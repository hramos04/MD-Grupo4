Good nutrition is a cornerstone of health. A balanced diet provides the body with the nutrients it needs for energy, growth, and repair. 
A healthy eating pattern includes a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. 
Nutrient-rich foods can help maintain a healthy weight and prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.
Eating a balanced diet also plays a critical role in mental well-being, as certain nutrients can impact brain function.
