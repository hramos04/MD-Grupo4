Climate change refers to long-term changes in the temperature, precipitation patterns, and other climate systems of Earth. 
Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly contributed to global warming. 
This warming leads to rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. 
Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy, 
and promote sustainable practices in various sectors.
