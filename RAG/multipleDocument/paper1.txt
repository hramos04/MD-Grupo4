Sleep is a vital, often-neglected component of our overall health. It is essential for both physical and mental well-being. 
Sleep allows the body to repair itself, consolidates memories, and plays a key role in maintaining cognitive function. 
The average adult needs 1-2 hours of sleep per night for optimal health. Lack of sleep can have significant negative effects, 
including impaired concentration, mood changes, and increased risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. 
Sleep hygiene, including a regular sleep schedule and a comfortable sleep environment, is essential for good sleep.
