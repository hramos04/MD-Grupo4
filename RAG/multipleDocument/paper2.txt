Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health. It helps improve cardiovascular health, increases 
muscle strength, and boosts overall energy levels. Exercise has also been shown to reduce stress and improve mental health. 
A balanced exercise routine, including aerobic and strength training exercises, can be beneficial for overall well-being. 
It is recommended to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week.
