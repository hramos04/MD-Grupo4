cloud computing, and robotics have created new opportunities and challenges for society. While technology has made life more 
convenient, it also raises ethical concerns, such as privacy issues and the potential for job displacement. 
As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to consider both the benefits and risks to ensure that it serves the public good.
