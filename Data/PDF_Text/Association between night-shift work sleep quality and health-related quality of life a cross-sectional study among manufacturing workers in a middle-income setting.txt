This study aimed to determine the impact of night- shift work on health- related quality of life HRQoL, and to assess whether sleep quality was a mediating factor. Design A cross- sectional study. Setting 11 manufacturing factories in Malaysia. Participants 177 night- shift workers aged 40–65 years old were compared with 317 non- night- shift workers. Primary and secondary outcomes Participants completed a self- administered questionnaire on socio- demographics and lifestyle factors, 12- item Short Form Health Survey V.2 SF- 12v2 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI. The Baron and Kenny’s method, Sobel test and multiple mediation model with bootstrapping were applied to determine whether PSQI score or its components mediated the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. Results Night- shift work was associated with sleep impairment and HRQoL. Night- shift workers had significantly lower mean scores in all the eight SF-12 domains p0.001. Compared with non- night- shift workers, night- shift workers were significantly more likely to report poorer sleep quality, longer sleep latency, shorter sleep duration, sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction p0.001. Mediation analyses showed that PSQI global score mediated the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. ‘Subjective sleep quality’ indirect effect=−0.24, SE=0.14 and bias corrected BC 95% CI −0.58 to −0.01 and ‘sleep disturbances’ indirect effect=−0.79, SE=0.22 and BC 95% CI −1.30 to −0.42 were mediators for the association between night- shift work and physical well- being, whereas ‘sleep latency’ indirect effect=−0.51, SE=0.21 and BC 95% CI −1.02 to −0.16 and ‘daytime dysfunction’ indirect effect=−1.11, SE=0.32 and BC 95% CI −1.86 to −0.58 were mediators with respect to mental well- being. Conclusion Sleep quality partially explains the association between night- shift work and poorer HRQoL. Organisations should treat the sleep quality of night- shift workers as a top priority area for action to improve their employees’ overall wellbeing. Strengths and limitations of this study ► The strengths of the study lie in the methodologies used to assess mediation, including the classical method of Baron and Kenny, Sobel test and multiple mediation analysis with bootstrapping. ► Post- hoc mediation analyses were performed to determine whether other lifestyle factors may have explained the association between night- shift work and health- related quality of life. ► The nature of study limits the assessment of causal relationship and bidirectional effects. Shift work is defined by the International Labour Organization as a ‘method of organ- isation of working time in which workers succeed one another at the workplace so that the establishment can operate longer than the normal working hours of an individual’.1 As shift work is essential especially in manu- facturing sectors to optimise productivity and maintain business competitiveness, it is widely adopted around the world.2 Shift work has been found to be associ- ated with a myriad of adverse health impacts, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, cancers and reproductive disor- ders.3–6 Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that night- shift work is associ- ated with poor general well- being, as well as depression and anxiety.7–11 A study among more than 2000 women in Korea showed that working in rotating shift or night shift was associated with significantly poor health- related quality of life HRQoL.12 HRQoL is defined as the way health is empirically esti- mated to affect QoL.13 Sleep disturbance is a common problem faced by night- shift workers.

A number of studies have demonstrated that poor sleep quality and short sleep duration is associated with mood disturbances and lower subjective well- being.14 15 However, it remains unclear whether poor sleep quality explains the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. Previous studies examining the association between shift work and HRQoL have treated sleep quality as a confounder and not as a mediator.16 17 Given the scarcity of evidence and a high demand for night- shift work worldwide, more evidence is needed to improve our understanding on the impact of night- shift work on health. The first part of our study, which focused on the association between night- shift work and metabolic syndrome, has been published elsewhere.4 In the present work, we investigated the association between night- shift work and HRQoL, and assessed whether sleep quality was a mediating factor. Knowledge on whether sleep quality mediates this association will provide an avenue for early intervention to improve the overall well- being of night- shift workers.18 Study design This cross- sectional study was conducted between October Security Organization’s SOCSO Health Screening Programme HSP.19 SOCSO is legislated to provide social security insurance to all private sector employees in Malaysia.19 The HSP was introduced by SOCSO in aged 40 years and above.19 The details on the study and selection of participants had been described in our previ- ously published paper,4 where 11 factories involved with manufacturing in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, that were registered with SOCSO were selected through conve- nience sampling. Invitation letters were sent to the respective human resource departments. All workers who participated in the HSP were invited to complete the study questionnaires.4 Out of 667 participants from the HSP, 510 workers fulfilled the criteria of no changes in their work schedule within 2 years prior to study recruit- ment. However, 16 participants failed to complete the study questionnaires, resulting in a final number of 494 participants. Data collection Data were collected using a self- administered Malay language questionnaire. The questionnaire included data on age, sex, ethnicity, education level and total income, participants’ smoking status ever or never and alcohol intake ever or never. The validated Malay version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire- Short Form was used to assess the level of physical activity.20 In the present study, night- shift work was defined as at least 8 hours of work between 0921:00 and 05:00, with at least 4 night shifts in a month.4 These include permanent night schedule, day–evening–night and day–night work schedules. Non- night- shift work comprised permanent daytime and day–evening- shift schedules. Sleep quality was assessed using the self- administered Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI questionnaire.21 The tool comprises seven components of sleep, that is, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction. It has been translated into the Malay language, and proven to be a valid and reliable question- naire.22 Each component of the questionnaire is rated on a 4- point scale 0–3, which generates a total score ranging between 0 and 21. A global score greater than five is an indication of poor sleep quality.21 HRQoL was assessed using 12- item Short Form Health Survey V.2 SF- 12v2, which is a shorter version of the 36- item Short Form Health Survey SF-36.23 It measures eight domains of health and well- being under two overall scales, that is, Physical Component Summary PCS and Mental Component Summary MCS scales. The PCS assesses physical functioning, including walking, bending, stretching and climbing stairs, without limitation and problems of work or other daily activity resulting from the physical health. It consists of physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, body pain and general health perceptions. The MCS, on the other hand, assesses general well- being, psychological distress, degree of happiness and limitations that emotional problems place on the extent of activities one is able to perform.23 It is made up of vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health domains. The Malay version of SF- 12v2 has been shown to have good internal consistency.24 The scoring of SF- 12v2 was calcu- lated using the Quality Metric Health Outcomes Scoring Software V.5.0. Each of the eight domains was scored out of 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. Statistical analysis The demographic and lifestyle characteristics of partici- pants were compared according to their shift work status. All categorical variables were described by proportions and compared using χ2 test. The non- parametric Mann- Whitney U test was used for asymmetrical continuous variables. The Baron and Kenny’s method and Sobel test4 were applied to assess whether the association between night- shift work and HRQoL was mediated by the PSQI global score. According to Baron and Kenny’s criteria,25 four statistical conditions need to be met to establish complete mediation or partial mediation. 1 Path c: night- shift work independent variable should significantly influ- ence HRQoL dependent variable. 2 Path a: night- shift work independent variable should significantly influence PSQI global score mediator. 3 Path b: PSQI global score mediator should also significantly influ- ence HRQoL dependent variable when adjusted for night- shift work status independent variable. 4 Path c′: mediation occurs if when Paths a and b are controlled, P r o t e c t e d b y c o p y r i g h t , i l i n c u d n g f o r u s e s r e l a t e d t o t e x t a n d d a t a m n n g i i , A I t r a i n n g i , a n d s i m i l a r t e c h n o o g i e s . l B M J O p e n : f i r s t p u b l i s h e d a s . / j b m o p e n - - o n S e p t e m b e r . l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p : / / j b m o p e n b m . j . c o m / o n A p r i l , a t i i U n v e r s d a d e d o M n h o i .

A complete medi- ation is established if the association between night- shift work and HRQoL is reduced to zero Path c′. The conceptual framework is shown in online supplementary material e- Figure 1 and summarised by the regression equations in online supplementary material e- Figure 2. To explore sleep quality dimensions, multiple medi- ation analysis using the PROCESS macro on SPSS V.21 developed by Hayes was employed to test a multiple medi- ation model with the seven components of the PSQI.26 This test allows multiple mediators to be examined and covariates to be controlled simultaneously.26 Bootstrap- ping was conducted to enable the detection of an indi- rect effect in the absence of total effect. Coefficient for Paths a, b and c were estimated using ordinary least squares regression. The mediation analysis was adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education level, total household income, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking status and physical activity. Bias corrected BC 95% CI for the indirect effects were generated from 5000 boot- strap samples26; statistically, significance was indicated when the BC 95% CI values do not cross zero.26 The paths between night- shift work independent vari- able, components of the PSQI mediators and physical/ mental well- being dependent variable are summarised in online supplementary material e- Figure 3: Paths a₁–a₇: night- shift work to each of the potential mediator; Paths b₁–b₇: each of the potential mediators to physical/mental well- being; Path c: the total effect of night- shift work to physical/mental well- being and Path c′: the direct effect of night- shift work on physical/mental well- being after adjusting for the effect of the potential mediators. Open access Patient and public involvement Study participants were not involved in the development of this study. The results from the blood investigation, along with the details of sleep quality and HRQoL, were discussed with the individual study participants during their follow- up visits. B M J O p e n : f i r s t p u b l i A total of 494 workers from 11 manufacturing factories participated in the study, of whom 177 36% were night- shift workers. Night- shift workers consisted of day–night- shift workers 94; 53%, day–evening–night- shift workers 75; 42% and permanent night- shift workers 8; 5%. Among the 317 non- night- shift workers 64%, 253 were permanent daytime workers 80%, while 64 were day– evening- shift workers 20%. As compared with non- night- shift worker, night- shift workers were younger 46 years old vs 47 years old, more likely to be female 68% vs 38% and predominantly of Malay ethnicity 81% vs 68%. They also reported significantly lower income RM5000 per month and were less likely to have attained tertiary education 10% vs 27% compared with non- night- shift workers. Detailed characteristics of study participants can be found in a previous publication.4 In general, night- shift workers had significantly lower mean scores in all eight SF-12 domains, which meant that night- shift workers reported substantially poorer HRQoL than non- night- shift workers table 1. The largest differ- ence was observed in the social functioning domain 44.39 vs 50.20 and the smallest difference in the vitality domain 52.90 vs 55.92. In addition, the summary scores showed a significantly lower SF-12 PCS 45.35 vs 48.58 and lower SF-12 MCS scores 47.31 vs 52.03 among night- shift P r o t e c t e d b y c o p y r i g h t , i l i n c u d n g f o r u s e s r e l a t e d t o t e x t a n d d a t a m n n g i i , Table 1 The SF-12 and the PSQI scores divided according to night- shift work status A I Night- shift workers Non- night- shift workers Parameters Variables for SF-12 General health perception Physical functioning Role limitation due to physical health Role limitation due to emotional problems Body pain Mental health Vitality Social functioning Physical Component Summary Mental Component Summary PSQI global score n=177 Mean±SD 42.07±9.06 46.91±8.75 45.26±8.48 45.03±9.61 45.43±8.91 47.39±7.99 52.90±8.12 44.39±8.66 45.35±7.19 47.31±8.83 n=317 Mean±SD 46.55±8.76 50.01±8.35 49.49±7.97 49.30±9.00 48.77±8.02 51.34±8.26 55.92±9.24 50.20±8.38 48.58±6.62 52.03±7.84 6.3±2.6 4.8±2.8 Non- parametric Mann- Whitney U Test.

Lim YC, et al. BMJ Open 2020;10:e034455. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034455 Open access workers compared with non- night- shift workers. The mean PSQI global score for night- shift workers was higher 6.3±2.6 as compared with non- night- shift workers 4.8±2.8, p0.001 and 95% CI 1.01 to 1.99, indicating poorer quality of sleep table 1. Compared with non- night shift workers, night- shift workers were significantly more likely to report longer sleep latency, poorer sleep quality, more sleep disturbances, shorter sleep duration and daytime dysfunction. The details of sleep quality can be found in our previously published paper.4 Mediation analysis using the Baron and Kenny’s method online supplementary material e- Figures 4 and 5 revealed that: 1 Path c: night- shift work was significantly associated with SF-12 PCS unstandardised β coefficient, β=−3.24, SE=0.64 and p0.001 and SF-12 MCS β=−4.72, SE=0.77 and p0.001, 2 Path a: night- shift work was significantly associated with PSQI global score β=1.50, SE=0.25 and p0.001, 3 Path b: PSQI global score was significantly associated with SF-12 PCS β=−0.57, SE=0.11 and p=0.001 and SF-12 MCS β=−0.71, SE=0.13 and p0.001 and 4 Path c′: after controlling for PSQI global score, night- shift work was still a significant predictor for SF-12 PCS β=−2.30, SE=0.67 and p0.001 and SF-12 MCS β=−3.42, SE=0.80 and p0.001. Thus, the associations between night- shift work and SF-12 PCS, and SF-12 MCS seem to be partially mediated by PSQI global score. The mediating effects of the seven individual compo- nents of the PSQI on the association between night- shift work and physical well- being were additionally tested table 2. Beyond the effects of covariates, the only signif- icant mediators were ‘subjective sleep quality’ indirect effect=−0.24, SE=0.14 and BC 95% CI −0.58 to −0.01 and ‘sleep disturbances’ indirect effect=−0.79, SE=0.22 and BC 95% CI −1.30 to −0.42. Indirect effects through ‘subjective sleep quality’ and ‘sleep disturbances’ were significant as the point estimate for these two compo- nents did not cross zero. The total indirect effect was statistically significant indirect effect=−1.43, SE=0.33, BC 95% CI −2.15 to −0.84. In term of effect ratio, the contribution of subjective sleep quality and sleep distur- bances components as mediators in the association between night- shift work and SF-12 PCS was 8% and 21%, respectively. On ‘sleep the other hand, latency’ indirect effect=−0.51, SE=0.21 and BC 95% CI −1.02 to −0.16 and ‘daytime dysfunction’ indirect effect=−1.11, SE=0.32 and BC 95% CI −1.86 to −0.58 were found to mediate the association between night- shift work and mental well- being table 3. The total indirect effect was statis- tically significant indirect effect=−2.14, SE=0.39 and BC 95% CI −3.00 to −1.43. The contribution of sleep latency and daytime dysfunction as mediators in the association between night- shift work and mental well- being was 10% Table 2 Mediation model between night- shift work and PCS as mediated by components of PSQI P r o t e c t e d b y c o p y r i g h t , i l i n c u d n g f o r u s e s r e l a t e d t o t e x t Path a Path b Path c Path c′ Path ab β SE P value β SE P value β SE P value β SE P value Path Potential mediators Subjective sleep quality Sleep latency Sleep duration 0.23 0.06 0.46 0.09 0.19 0.09 Habitual sleep efficiency −0.11 0.07 Sleep disturbances Use of sleep medications Daytime dysfunction 0.32 0.05 0.01 0.03 0.41 0.06 −3.16 0.64 0.001 −1.73 0.71 0.015 0.001 0.001 0.036 0.146 0.001 0.854 0.001 −1.05 0.56 −0.53 0.34 0.19 0.36 0.03 0.44 −2.50 0.59 −1.54 0.99 −0.44 0.48 0.060 0.113 0.606 0.954 0.001 0.120 0.365 Total indirect effects a₁b₁ a₂b₂ a₃b₃ a₄b₄ a₅b₅ a₆b₆ a₇b₇ AB β SE −0.24 0.14 −0.24 0.15 0.04 0.08 −0.01 0.05 −0.79 0.22 −0.01 0.06 −0.18 0.21 −1.43 0.33 BC 95% CI −0.58 to −0.01 −0.61 to 0.01 −0.09 to 0.27 −0.12 to 0.10 −1.30 to −0.42 −0.18 to 0.08 −0.61 to 0.21 −2.15 to −0.84 Mediation analysis performed by PROCESS macro.

Given that the association between nightshift work and HRQoL was not completely mediated by sleep quality, post- hoc analysis was performed to assess whether other lifestyle factors may have mediated the association. Anal- yses using Baron and Kenny’s criteria data not shown and Sobel test showed that neither smoking status Z=0.05 and p=0.963, alcohol intake Z=0.94 and p=0.346 nor physical activity Z=0.86 and p=0.389 mediated the association between night- shift work and physical well- being and neither smoking status Z=0.42 and p=0.675, alcohol intake Z=0.42 and p=0.675 nor physical activity Z=0.84 and p=0.375 mediated the association between night- shift work and mental well- being data not shown. Our current study findings suggest that night- shift work is associated with lower HRQoL compared with non- night- shift work, on both the physical and mental well- being domains. This association appears to be partially medi- ated by sleep quality. Our finding that night- shift workers were associated with worst sleep quality compared with non- night- shift workers is consistent with findings from previous studies.7 27 Sleep deprivation had received increasing attention for its adverse impact on HRQoL. The current results are also in agreement with prior studies investigating the association between sleep and general well- being, which have indi- cated that poor sleep quality is detrimental to the physical and mental well- being.28 29 This is corroborated further by findings of a clinical trial, in which use of hypnosis to treat participants with insomnia resulted in significant improvements in several domains of the SF-36.30 Besides being associated with poorer HRQoL, a meta- analysis of 34 cohort studies had reported that insomnia is significantly associated with depression Relative Risk RR=2.27 and 95% CI 1.89 to 2.71,31 whereby depression is found to have severe impact on HRQoL.32 There are several mechanistic pathways that have been postulated to explain the association between poor sleep quality and poor HRQoL. Firstly, night- shift work is associated with reduction in production of melatonin, given that its production takes place in darkness and is inhibited by exposure to bright light at night.33 There is evidence showing that treatment with melatonin may improve quality of life in cancer patients and epileptic children.34 35 Secondly, poor sleep quality leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system via the hypo- thalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.36 This in turn will lead to alteration of metabolic and endocrine functions, which has been found to be associated with poor HRQoL.37 Finally, the increased levels of C reactive protein and interleukin-6 due to poor sleep quality have been found to be associated with poor HRQoL.38 Our study showed that sleep quality appears to be a significant mediator in the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. Further analysis showed that the asso- ciation between night- shift work and physical well- being was mediated through ‘subjective sleep quality’ and ‘sleep disturbances’, whereas the association between night- shift work and mental well- being was mediated through ‘sleep latency’ and ‘daytime dysfunction’. These findings have not been reported previously and warrant further investigation. Besides sleep, other possible mediators such as stress and sedentary lifestyle may link night- shift work and HRQoL. Stress due to night- shift work might lead to lower HRQoL.39 Besides the above, shift workers are also likely to lead unhealthy lifestyles, such as low recreational physical activity and smoking, which have been found to be associated with lower HRQoL.40 In view of the above, in addition to adjusting for smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity in the multivariable analysis, post- hoc analyses were performed to determine whether any of the above- mentioned lifestyle factors acted as mediators in the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. However, our findings suggest that these lifestyle factors do not mediate the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. We acknowledge some limitations of the present study. The nature of this study limits our ability to explain causal relationships and bi- directional effects among shift work, sleep quality and HRQoL. Reverse causation whereby lower HRQoL leads to poorer sleep quality is possible. A lower HRQoL could in itself manifest as psychological distress,32 which is also known to affect sleep quality.41 There is a possibility of misclassification, since shift work, sleep quality and HRQoL were self- reported. Even though sleep was not measured objectively using actigraphy or polysomnography, it should be noted that the PSQI is a validated tool for measuring sleep quality. The infor- mation on the chronotype, stress levels and drug history anxiolytics, hypnotics or psychotropics of the partici- pants were not collected; thus, the confounding effects of these factors were not evaluated. Finally, the sample size is relatively small. The novelty of our present work lies in the robust medi- ation analysis that we had employed to ascertain the role of sleep quality as a potential mediating factor in the association between night- shift work and HRQoL. Apart from the above, we also undertook post- hoc mediation analyses to determine whether other lifestyle factors may P r o t e c t e d b y c o p y r i g h t , i l i n c u d n g f o r u s e s r e l a t e d t o t e x t a n d d a t a m n n g i i , A I t r a i n n g i , a n d s i m i l a r t e c h n o o g i e s . l B M J O p e n : f i r s t p u b l i s h e d a s . / j b m o p e n - - o n S e p t e m b e r . l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p : / / j b m o p e n b m . j . c o m / o n A p r i l , a t i i U n v e r s d a d e d o M n h o i . Lim YC, et al. BMJ Open 2020;10:e034455. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034455 have explained the association between shift work and HRQoL. The findings from this study underscore the importance of monitoring sleep quality among night- shift workers. There is an urgent need for development and imple- mentation of multidisciplinary interventions focusing on the improvement of sleep quality in affected night- shift workers. Nonetheless, any such intervention strat- egies, including medications such as modafinil and melatonin supplement, cognitive–behavioural therapy and education programmes, must be tested for effective- ness through randomised trials.18 Future studies aiming to unravel other potential mediators linking night- shift work and HRQoL are also warranted to improve the overall well- being of employees, as better HRQoL has been found to be significantly associated with higher productivity.
