Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 Open Access The negative impact of chronic tobacco smoking on adult neuropsychological function: a cross-sectional study Mohammed Sh. Nadar1 , Abdullah M. Hasan2 and Mohammed Alsaleh2 Abstract Background: The evidence on the effects of chronic tobacco smoking on neuropsychological functions is conflicting. The literature remains limited by inconsistent accounting for potentially confounding biomedical and psychiatric conditions. This study aimed to assess the neuropsychological functions of adult chronic tobacco smokers in comparison to group-matched non-smokers. Method: The study included 73 smokers and 84 group-matched non-smokers. The data was collected during the year 2019. After an initial interview to collect demographics and smoking profile, the subjects undertook neuropsychological assessments that targeted a wide range of cognitive domains. Results: The performance of smokers was poorer on almost all neuropsychological domains, namely selective attention p ≤ .001, p = .044, alternating attention p = .002 working memory p ≤ .001, Short-term memory p = .006 and .003, Long-term memory p ≤ .001, processing accuracy p ≤ .001, and executive function p = .011 and .026. Smokers were intact on processing speed. Smoking accumulation and lower age onset of regular smoking were correlated with lower neuropsychological function. Conclusion: Our findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic tobacco smoking impacts cognition negatively.

Smoking is one form of tobacco exposure that is preva- lent across the world. The harmful impact of chronic tobacco smoking on physical health is well documented and includes cardio- vascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and various forms of cancer .

A large number of studies have examined the effects of smoking on neuropsychological function across mul- tiple variables. Compared to non-smokers, chronic smoking was cumulatively reported to have detrimental effects on various neuropsychological domains, including general intellectual abilities, processing speed, attention, memory, cognitive flexibility and executive functions 2, 3, 5. The effects of smoking on cognition are believed to vary based on the dose and onset of regular use.

Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 example, a 10-year longitudinal study of 1436 older adults found that smokers were less likely to develop cognitive impairment than those who had never smoked . Another study consisting of 2553 adults found smokers to have lower rates of cognitive impairment compared to non-smokers , and both studies con- cluded that smoking may be protective of cognitive function. Several other studies also support the notion that cigarette smoking seems not to affect cognition or to have a positive effect on some aspects of cognitive function of smokers 8–11. the studies did not account function . The influence of Based on the current literature, it is difficult to draw solid conclusions on the impact of smoking on neuro- psychological tobacco smoking on specific domains of cognition is complex and much remains to be known about its impact on neuropsychology and cognition. The literature remains limited by inconsistent accounting for potentially con- founding biomedical and psychiatric conditions. For ex- ample, many of for confounding variables such as psychiatric disorders and comorbid substance abuse i.e., alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs. In other studies, the duration of tobacco use was not taken into account . Other studies var- ied in terms of which subcategories of specific neuro- psychological domains were tested. Some controversy also remains regarding smoking effect on specific cogni- tive functions, and individual differences in smoking cognitive effects. Consequently, it is essential to continue to investigate the association between chronic tobacco smoking and potential neuropsychological impairments while controlling for possible confounding variables. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the neuro- psychological functions of chronic tobacco smokers in comparison to group-matched non-smokers. It was hy- pothesized that chronic tobacco smokers would have significantly poorer global neuropsychological functions compared to non-smokers. smoking group, the participant must have been a smoker for at least 10 years and smoked a minimum of one pack per day.

Past smokers functions that The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all participants signed a written consent form to participate in the study before data collection. An ini- tial interview collected information related to socio- demographic, health, and smoking profiles. After the interview session, all participants completed a compre- hensive battery of outcome measures assessing neuro- psychological target a wide range of cognitive domains. All the measures used in this study have well-established and comprehensive psychometric properties, and were used in other studies on neuro- psychological function a brief description of each meas- ure is provided in Table 1. In addition to the neuropsychological measures, we used the Grooved Peg- board Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN as a measure of fine motor dexterity, which requires visual-spatial and motor coordination. The test battery was administered by a trained researcher, and the entire battery required about 60–70 min to complete. The participants were allowed short breaks between tests, and smokers were free to smoke during the breaks if desired. The sequence of outcome measures was administered consistently across all participants. After completion of all measures, the participants were presented with two questions which they were required to answer by “Yes” or “No”. 1 “Do you believe that smoking increases the risk of physical health problems, such as getting heart disease, lung disease, stroke and cancer?”, and 2 “Do you believe that smoking increases the risk of cognitive health problems, such as reduced memory, attention, and concentration?”. Method Participants and procedure We recruited the participants via social medial and local adverts during the year 2019. The participants were interviewed regarding cigarette smoking and use of other tobacco products. We excluded participants who re- ported current use of other substances that are known to affect cognition i.e., alcohol, cannabis, and psycho- tropic medications, except for caffeine up to 3 months prior to study enrollment. Since psychiatric illness is strongly correlated to cognitive impairment, we excluded subjects with any known psychiatric problems or mental diseases. Participants with any medical condition or his- tory of serious head injury that are known to influence cognition were also excluded.

The number of correct answers in each condition W, C, CW in 45 s. Processing speed and alternating attention Executive function 10–15 min The primary score is the response time required to complete each trial. The norms for each trail are presented in the form of Percentile ranks and T-scores, which have a mean of 50 and a standard devi- ation of 10. Error scores, with lower scores indicating better executive function. Perseveration errors number of errors where the participant has used the same rule as the previous choice Non-perseveration errors all remaining incorrect responses other than the Perseveration errors This executive function measure primarily assesses the ability to inhibit interference from distracting stimuli i.e., selective attention in a fixed time i.e., processing speed. In this test, the subject is instructed to read the names of colors from three different conditions as fast as possible. In the first condition, the subject reads a list of color names printed in black ink W = Word. Next, the subject is presented with a card containing shapes in different colors of ink, and the subject names the color of the ink C = Color. In the third condition, the subject is given a card with color names written in an incongruent ink color when the words and colors do not match. The subject is required to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word CW = Color- Word. That is, the subject is required to inhibit the interference arising from reading the word i.e., an automated task and naming the color of the ink i.e., an effortful task. The CTMT test uses a set of five standardized visual search and sequencing tasks trials to evaluate brain functions. The CTMT requires the participant to utilize visual scanning and sequencing abilities to draw lines to connect a series of stimuli numbers or letters in a specified order as fast as possible. We used Trial 1 processing speed and Trial 5 alternating attention. The WCST-64 is a measure of ab- stract thinking in which the partici- pant has to classify cards with various geometric shapes in differ- ent colors and numbers according to different criteria e.g., color, shape, or number. The participants are ex- pected to accurately sort every re- sponse card with one of four stimulus cards through feedback right or wrong given to them based on a classification rule. The rule changes every few cards with- out prior notice, and the participant has to figure out the new rule. It is typical for the participant to start making one or more mistakes when the rule changes. The Contextual Memory Test The participant is presented with pictures of 20 related objects for 90 s, as the items to be remembered. Short-term memory and long-term memory number of objects correctly recalled Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 Table 1 Assessments used in the study Continued Description No. Measure Variables measured Time to administer Scoring short-term memory and working memory The maximum number of forward or backward digits recalled without error The Digit Span Task The d2 Test of Attention The participant is then requested to recall the objects immediately and again after 15 min. In this test, the subjects are read a series of digits of increasing length and asked to repeat the same sequence back to the examiner in order forward span or reverse order backward span. Forward span captures attention efficiency and short-term memory capacity. Backward span is an executive task particularly dependent on working memory. The participant is presented with a paper that has 14 rows, each comprised of 47 characters, for a total of 658 items. The participant is instructed to scan each row and cross out any letter “d” that has two dashes, which can be above or below the letter “d” in any order while ignoring/suppressing irrelevant distracters. The distractors are orthographically similar stimuli the letters “p” or “d” with 1–4 dashes over and under each letter. The participant is allowed 20 s per row before moving to the next one, with no pauses allowed between rows processing speed, selective attention, sustained attention, and quality of visual scanning performance in response to the discrimination of similar visual stimuli. Total number of items processed TN: The aggregated number of processed items both correct and incorrect from each raw. This is a measure of processing speed. Omission errors OE: The number of missed correct items. This is a measure of processing accuracy carelessness. Commission errors CE: The number of incorrect items crossed out. This is a measure of processing accuracy impulsivity, with lower scores indicating better function. Total number of errors TE: Total number of commission and omission errors OE + CE. Total performance TP: The difference between the total number of items processed and the total number of errors TN-TE. This is a measure of the balance between processing speed and accuracy of attention mechanisms. The time required to complete 25 pegs.

Data for all neuropsychological tasks are summarized In the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Table 3. MoCA, both groups performed above the cutoff score of 26/30, indicating global cognition scores within the “normal” range. Nonetheless, the smokers’ group scored significantly lower than the non-smokers’ group p = .042 with a moderate effect size of .49.

The Digit Span Task revealed comparable short-term memory results to the Contextual Memory Test, where the non-smokers’ group performed better than the smoking group p = .003, d = .40. For working memory, a significant and large effect size of .75 was de- tected in favor of the non-smokers’ group p ≤ .001. The total number of items processed in the d2 Test of Attention was similar in both groups, indicating parallel processing speed.

There was an association between lifetime years of smoking and poorer performance on the fine Grooved Pegboard psychomotor measure of motor dexterity r = −.41; p = .047. The age onset of regular smoking was also correlated with the lower performance in the same measures above; namely selective attention r = − 0.41; p = .037, alternating attention r = − 0.29; p = .048, working memory r = − 0.62; p ≤ .001, and also processing accuracy of the d2 Test of Attention r = − 0.46; p = .039. There were no other significant correlations between the number of cigarettes smoked per day or Pack-Years and neuropsychological performance. When asking the participants about the effects of smoking on health, 100% of non-smokers and 92% of smokers believe that smoking has negative effects on physical health, while 37% of non-smokers and 19% of smokers believed that smoking has negative effects on cognitive health. Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 of chronic functions Discussion The current study aimed to assess and compare the neuropsychological tobacco smokers in comparison to non-smokers. As hypothe- sized, the results indicated that chronic tobacco smokers had significantly poorer neuropsychological functions compared to their group-matched non-smokers. The poorer performance was apparent in almost all cognitive domains, namely attention, memory, processing accur- acy, and executive function, but not processing speed. With respect to global neuropsychological function, the performance of smokers in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA was not impaired since they scored within the “normal” range. Nonetheless, their perform- ance was compared to their matched non-smokers. Despite the “normal” results of the MoCA, the more dedicated measures in this study clearly revealed a sub-optimal neuropsychological per- formance of our smokers’ group. significantly weaker The effects of smoking on memory performance is in- consistent in the literature, with studies reporting signifi- cant differences between smokers and non-smokers in some memory measures 4, 21–25 while others report- ing insignificant differences 10, 21, 22, 26–28. Our re- sults showed the neuropsychological domain of memory to be affected in our smoking sample and with group differences of moderate to strong effect sizes, as our non-smokers’ group outperformed the smokers in all components of memory measures. The non-smokers’ group had better short-term and long-term memory as indicated by their superior capacity to recall information in the Contextual Memory Test, which involves visual presentation of pictures, as well as the Digit Span Task, which involves auditory and verbal presentation of num- bers. Working memory was particularly compromised in our chronic tobacco smokers, as evident by the largest the neuropsychological effect measures employed in this study. Similar results for working memory impairments were found in middle- aged adults 22, 29, young adults 30–33 and even ado- lescent smokers . Based on the compromised overall memory performance of smokers, it is plausible to state that chronic tobacco smoking may predispose the devel- opment of dementia. size d = .75 amongst While the effects of tobacco smoking on memory have been widely studied, their effects on attention have been less investigated. Attention is central for learning and memory since encoding information requires attention in the first place. The smokers in our study were less able to block irrelevant information and focus their se- lective attention on the task at hand. This was strongly demonstrated in the Stroop Color and Word Test and less significantly demonstrated in the d2 Test of Atten- tion. Alternating attention was also affected in our stimuli, smokers’ CTMT test, indicating more difficulty to disen- gage and reengage the focus of attention in response to environmental in comparison to the non- smokers’ group. Our findings on the domain of attention are consistent with the literature where attention was found to be affected in smokers 28, 31, but contrasted several other studies where attention was not affected 10, 26, 33, 34. Given the intertwined relationship be- tween attention and memory, it is reasonable to suggest that smoking may diminish memory as a result of de- creasing attentional capacities, reflected in reduced abil- ity to resist distraction and blocking irrelevant stimuli. Executive function involves the simultaneous use of a set of cognitive abilities to allow the individual to per- form higher-level complex tasks. The findings in our study detected a significant executive function difference in favor of the non-smokers’ group, who performed bet- ter in both subtests of the WCST-64. These results are consistent with previous literature findings of executive function limitation among smokers 9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 26, 31, 35, indicating that chronic tobacco smokers have in- ferior mental flexibility and abstract thinking compared to non-smokers. Interestingly, processing speed was not significantly af- fected in the smoking group across all the four subtests we used in this study, albeit two of the subtests were sta- tistically borderline p = .052, .055. These findings agree with few studies 10, 26, 31, 33, but contrast with most other studies that assessed processing speed for their smoking participants 4, 21, 22, 36–38. Despite this finding, the processing accuracy of our smokers’ sample was significantly lower than non-smokers p ≤ .001. That is, the smokers’ processing speed matched that of non-smokers, but with a significantly higher number of errors. The substandard performance of smokers on measures of processing accuracy, as evident by a signifi- cantly higher number of cognitive errors, should be added to a growing list of neuropsychological sequelae associated with persistent smoking. Within the smoker group, smoking onset was corre- lated with lower performance on working memory, se- lective attention, alternating attention, and the number of errors made. This means that individuals who start smoking at a younger age are at a greater risk of devel- oping neuropsychological dysfunction. The impairments appear to manifest very early in smokers, as demon- strated in the inferior working memory of adolescents with a mean of only 4 years of smoking . Additional support on the effects of smoking on the young brain was objectively shown in functional magnetic resonance imaging where young adult smokers had reduced pre- frontal cortex activation during attentional tasks when compared with non-smokers . This pronounced negative effects of smoking on the young brain might be Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 explained by the fact that the prefrontal cortex has not completed its maturation, as the prefrontal cortex is one of the last brain areas to mature and is still developing during adolescence and early adulthood . This stage of ongoing development makes the brain more suscep- tible to the influence of tobacco smoking and other psy- choactive substances . Correspondingly, smoking accumulation in this study similarly affected neuropsychological function, meaning the longer an individual smoked during their lifetime, the more prone they become to cognitive dysfunction. These results are consistent with other studies that re- ported total lifetime years of smoking to be correlated with inferior neuropsychological efficiency and ex- ecutive function . Interestingly, the number of ciga- rettes per day or pack-years were not associated with neuropsychological performance in this study, contrast- ing the main findings of a recent review conducted by Conti et al. 2019, in which several studies included in their review reported a negative link between the num- ber of pack-years and neuropsychological function . This discrepancy in results may be confounded by the considerable variations in the number of pack-years re- ported across studies ranging from 4.26 to 73.73 . The magnitude of differences between smokers and non-smokers in this study extend beyond neuropsycho- logical function to include the psychomotor domain as well. Our non-smokers’ group outperformed the smok- ing group in the Grooved Pegboard test of fine motor dexterity, albeit with a relatively small effect size of .37. Durazzo et al. also reported significantly poorer fine motor dexterity performance in their smoking sample, but with much larger effect sizes i.e., .72. The psycho- motor function was also negatively correlated with smoking accumulation, where longer lifetime smoking was associated with reduced fine motor dexterity. The question arises related to the reasons for hetero- geneity in study outcomes between studies of compar- able designs. For example, processing speed was reported in some studies to be reduced among smokers 4, 21, 22, 36–38 but not in other studies 10, 26, 31, 33. The same point can be raised for memory and at- tention. Several reasons could explain such variations in the performance; 1 The outcome measures used to as- sess the target variable i.e., processing speed are differ- ent across studies, which may vary in their sensitivity and other psychometric properties. 2 Some studies did not report which version of the tests they used e.g., ori- ginal version, modified version, pen and paper, or elec- it tronic version. Depending on the assessment used, could involve a visual task, an auditory task, or even a motor task. An assessment that involves the use of pen and paper will recruit a variety of motor and cognitive pathways in the brain to facilitate writing or tracing, while an electronic version of the same assessment will involve different brain pathways. Such variations in as- sessment components could yield different results. These factors make it less accurate to perform cross-study comparisons or to compare the study scores with nor- mative data. A possible solution to help makes the re- sults more comparable across studies, and thus more clinically meaningful, is to use complete reporting of the specific testing procedures e.g., test version, subtests used, and scoring methods and to use consistent and systematic data collection and analysis procedures. The participants awareness about the negative effects of smoking on physical health were very high. However, their awareness about the negative effects of smoking on neuropsychological health was low, particularly among smokes 37% of non-smokers and 19% of smokers. This very low awareness of the negative consequences of smoking on neuropsychological function among smokers and non-smokers is a major public health issue that should be properly addressed. Since tobacco smoking remains highly prevalent across the globe and is known to be influenced by public per- ception of risk and associations with negative outcomes , it is imperative to invest further in policy initiatives to control smoking. The emphasis of public health cam- paigns primarily focuses on physical health, and less commonly address neuropsychological health. Increasing public awareness should go beyond the already estab- lished physical health consequences to include the nega- tive impact of smoking on neuropsychological function. We hope that raising awareness about the wider effects of tobacco smoking on cognition could help encourage people to stop smoking. Limitations and future research There are several limitations and areas for improvement in future research. Although we attempted group match- ing for demographics and health variables, the self- reported health & medical profile can be problematic due to matters of inaccuracy of some participants. Fu- ture research should adopt standardized screening mea- sures to provide accurate objective measures. The scope of neuropsychological associated with chronic cigarette smoking has yet to be fully delineated. Large-scale prospective studies with more consistent, highly sensitive, and robust cognitive outcome measures are required to determine the true links between smok- ing and neuropsychological dysfunction. impairment Conclusion Chronic tobacco smoking seems to be a prospective risk factor for neuropsychological impairment, as expressed in our data by reduced attention, memory, executive function, and processing accuracy of smokers compared Nadar et al. BMC Public Health 2021 21:1278 to their group-matched non-smokers. The cognitive per- formance of participants decreased as the number of years smoking increased. Similarly, the younger the age when regular smoking started, the lower was the cogni- tive performance. The consequences of smoking go be- yond neuropsychological performance to encompass fine motor dexterity tasks as well.
