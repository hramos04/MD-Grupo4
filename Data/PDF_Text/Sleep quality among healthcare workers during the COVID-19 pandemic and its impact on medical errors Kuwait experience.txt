Sleep Quality Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Medical Errors: Kuwait Experience. Turk Thorac J 2021; 222: 142-8. Abstract OBJECTIVE: Millions of people suffer from sleep disturbances. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic created several new challenges–particularly for frontline healthcare workers HCWs. This study assessed the sleep quality SQ among HCWs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an English-language online survey. The participants were invited via a web link sent using social network platforms. It included sociodemographic- and profession-related characteristics. COVID- 19-associated risks were assessed e.g., being on the front line, doing swabs, satisfaction about protective equipment, and management protocols. Assessment of SQ was done using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI and various medical errors were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 217 HCWs completed the survey with mean ±standard deviation age of 35.8 ±7.3 years; 56.2% were male, 18.43% had comorbidities, and 61.75% experienced sleep difficulties before the COVID-19 crisis. This work reports a 78.8% prevalence of poor SQ, with the mean standard deviation global PSQI score of 9.36 ±4.4. HCWs with poor sleep experienced more positive co- morbid profile 23.64% versus 6.52%, p=0.01. Working on the front lines of COVID-19 was associated with poor sleep 69.59% versus 47.83%, p=0.006. Among the participants, 77.42% performed medical errors, particularly not checking for drug allergies 17.97%, dispensing medication with incomplete instructions 20.74%, providing incorrect doses or overdosing 14.75%, incorrectly explaining the use of medication 9.22%, and prescribing a drug to the wrong patient 10.14%. CONCLUSION: This nationwide survey reported high prevalence of poor SQ among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being an HCW on the front lines of COVID-19 and doing swabs with a positive comorbidity was associated with poor sleep. KEYWORDS: COVID-19, medical errors, sleep quality Received: October 23, 2020 Accepted: January 21, 2021 Sleep is a refreshing, healing, and crucial part of human physiology. Sleep disturbances and deprivation, particularly in a chronic form, are linked to immune system depression and affect memory. This could be alarming in physicians, whose main responsibility is to care for the sick and critically ill, make decisions, and calculate doses–responsibilities in which there is no space for errors 1–5. Coronaviruses are known animal and human pathogens. By the end of 2019, a pneumonia cluster with an unidentified etiology was reported by Chinese officials; afterwards, a novel coronavirus was identified. In February 2020, the World Health Organization WHO designated the disease “coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19.” The virus that causes the disease was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus 2. Initially, cases outside China occurred mainly among travelers from China and those who had contact with them. However, the WHO now considers COVID-19 a pandemic . Sleep disturbances were prevalent in millions of people even before the pandemic, a global event that created a fertile en- vironment for new challenges in those who had not experienced sleep problems before. Infected persons and healthcare workers HCWs on the front line are at higher risk than others. Lockdowns, social distancing, distance learning, quaran- tines, fear about oneself and ones loved ones, and economic consequences added burdens to normal routine life 7–9. It was a common finding that HCWs took frequent night shifts, on-call hours, and experienced stress that led to loss of sleep and manifested symptoms of sleep deprivation.

Sleep Quality Among HCWs During COVID-19 Pandemic Statistics provided in China show that HCWs in Wuhan, the initial epicenter of COVID-19, experienced high levels of anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and stress because of exces- sive work pressures, direct exposure to the disease, and the possibility of being infected. Extensive research confirms that sleep deprivation affects the functioning and concentration of physicians. Allowing sleep deprivation to permeate all medical specialties will cause damage both to patients and healthcare professionals 10,11. Given the importance of sleep and its known effect on cogni- tive performance, the link between sleep and patient safety has garnered considerable attention. proximately 5%, the minimal sample size was calculated to be 209 participants Epi Info 7, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. Data Collection An English-language online survey was conducted via Google forms. Participants from different medical specialties were invited to complete this via an online web link sent us- ing social network platforms. Google forms saves each filled questionnaire in the principal investigator’s Google Drive. Before collecting data, a pilot test was conducted on 10% of the sample not included in the study to estimate the av- erage time needed to finish the questionnaire, evaluate its adequacy, and predict suspected obstacles. In one report, fatigue is characterized as a latent hazard and “an unsafe condition” that leads to increased rates of medi- cal errors among HCWs. These cognitive activities place sig- nificant loads on prefrontal cortex functions, such as memory and tracking capacity, which are particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation and related fatigue. Respondents were assured of anonymity and confidentiality. Consent to participate was the first question and answering “yes” was mandatory. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the MOH, Kuwait. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki on hu- man research. Both acute and chronic sleep deprivation result in cumula- tive deficits in executive function and mood as well as height- ened irritability; all of these can impair communication and coordination in teams of HCWs. Chronic sleep deprivation can also contribute to burnout, which is increasingly recog- nized as a threat to patient safety . This study aimed to assess the sleep quality SQ among HCWs on the front line of COVID-19 management at Kuwait Ministry of Health MOH hospitals and its relationship to experiencing medical errors. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: HCWs at Kuwait MOH hospitals, Kuwait, from May–July 2020. Exclusion criteria • Age above 60 years. • Refusal to participate. • Incomplete or duplicate answers. • Not being on duty at the time of the study. Sample size: The prevalence of poor sleep in HCWs ranged from 21–66% . At a 90% confidence level with a type I error rate of ap- • • The prevalence of poor SQ during COVID-19 pandemic was 78.8% There was a higher frequency of medical errors in HCWs with poor SQ ; 82.46% versus 58.7% in those with good SQ. • Being a front line HCW, taking swabs, and having a positive comorbid profile were the three independent predictors of poor sleep among study participants. The survey focused on the following. Sociodemographic characteristics: age, sex, smoking and marital states, number of siblings, partner’s job, history of previous sleep disorders or medications affecting sleep, and comorbidities. Profession-related characteristics: specialty, current job title, years of experience, and number of hours worked per week. COVID-19-associated risks: being on the front line of COV- ID-19 management, doing swabs for suspected or confirmed cases, following updates and news about COVID-19, satisfac- tion with and availability of personal protective equipment PPE, satisfaction with management protocols and arrange- ments between triage and isolation, and becoming infected with or knowing a colleague/friend who was infected with or died of COVID-19. Assessment of SQ using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI: the PSQI is a simple tool that assesses SQ over a 1 month period. It includes 7 components, with a global PSQI score 5 being indicative of poor SQ 14–16. Documentation of various medical errors: not checking for drug allergies, dispensing medication with incomplete in- structions, accidental extubation, provision of incorrect dos- es or overdosage, incorrect explanation of the use of medica- tion, and prescribing drugs to the wrong patient. Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 17.1.0.0 for Windows Minitab Inc., 2013, State College, PA, USA. Continuous data were presented as mean and standard devia- tion SD and categorical data as number and percentage %; the normality of data was examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The associations between poor SQ and participant char- acteristics or COVID-19-related risks were evaluated using the Chi-square test and an independent t-test. The poor SQ prediction was evaluated using multiple regression analysis Turk Thorac J 2021; 222:142-8 Table 1.

Of these, 64 ex- perienced sleep difficulties before COVID-19 crisis and 21 9.68% had a history of consuming medication for sleep dif- ficulties. In this work, the reported prevalence of poor SQ during the COVID-19 pandemic and its stresses increased to 171 78.8%, with a global PSQI score mean SD of 9.36 ± 4.4; the worst components of SQ were sleep latency, du- ration, and efficacy; hence, the mean scores for these were near 2–1.94, 1.54, and 1.54, respectively, as illustrated in Table 1. Sociodemographic and profession-related character- istics and their relationship to poor SQ are shown in Table 2. All participants had mean SD age of 35.8 ± 7.3 years; of them, 56.2% were male, 8.76% were current smokers, and 18.43% had a positive comorbid profile. Moreover, 76.96% of the participants were married and 42.86% had a HCW partner. HCWs with poor sleep compared with good sleep experienced a more positive comorbid profile 23.64% ver- sus 6.52%, p=0.01, while there was no significant associa- tion between other sociodemographics age, sex, smoking status, and marital status with poor sleep state.

Working on the front line of COVID-19 was associated with poor sleep 69.59% versus 47.83%, p =0.006. Moreover, HCWs with poor sleep had higher weekly working hours compared with those with good sleep 67.25% versus 47.83, p =0.015. Table 3 highlights the impact of COVID-19-related risks on SQ. Among the participants, 81.11% were regularly followed updates and news about COVID-19, 45.16% were satisfied with their PPE, 48.39% were satisfied with the management protocol, and 52.99% were satisfied with the arrangement between triage and isolation. Moreover, 3.23% of partici- pants had been infected with COVID-19, 79.72% had a fam- ily member infected with COVID-19, 8.76% had a colleague infected with COVID-19, and, finally, 16.13% of them expe- rienced a colleague or a family member passed away because of COVID-19. Furthermore, 83.04% of participants with poor sleep compared with 67.39% of those with good sleep had a family member infected with COVID-19 p=0.01. Among the 32 participants who did swabs for suspected COVID-19 patients during their duties, 30 93.75% of them p =0.01 experienced poor sleep. The consequences of poor SQ on both HCWs and the rate of medical errors occurring are shown in Table 4. Of the participants, 77.42% experienced medical errors in the form of not checking for drug allergies 17.97%, dispens- ing medication with incomplete instructions 20.74%, un- planned extubation episodes 12.9%, giving incorrect doses or overdosage 14.75%, incorrectly explaining the usage of medications 9.22%, and prescribing a drug to the incorrect patient 10.14%. In participants with poor SQ, there was a higher frequency of experiencing medical errors compared with those with good sleep 82.46% versus 58.7%, p=0.006; this was particularly significant in the form of medications being dispensed with incomplete instructions 39.98% ver- sus 8.7%, p=0.02, incorrect or overdosage 17.54% versus Turk Thorac J 2021; 222:142-8 Table 5.

Moreover, 70.05% of participants showed nervousness with a greater association among those with a poor SQ, p0.001. Multivariate regression analysis of factors associated with poor SQ revealed three independenet predictors of poor SQ; being a front line HCW odds ratio OR = 2.80, p =0.01, doing swabs for suspected or confirmed cases OR = 4.95, p=0.032, with a positive comorbid profile OR = 4.57, p=0.017, Table 5. The impact of working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic as an independent predictor of poor SQ is illustrated in Table 6 using multivariate regression analysis models with adjusted and nonadjusted simulation. The likelihood of poor SQ increased up to 3 times in both ad- justed and nonadjusted models OR = 2.8; p=0.01 and 2.5; p=0.007, respectively. Sleep disorders are not uncommon among HCWs, including nurses; physicians; and administrative and technical staff. Grow- ing reports disagree about the prevalence of sleep difficulties among HCWs, which range from 21–65.5%. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant high stress levels, high chances of getting infected, inadequate availability of protec- tive equipment, high workloads, and exhaustion, HCWs are at an increased risk for mental health issues and sleep difficulties compared to the time before the pandemic 17–22. During any outbreak or pandemic with high transmissibility and mortality, screening for deleterious mental health effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and other sleep disturbances is desirable, particularly among HCWs. This not only assures their long-term wellbeing, but also keeps them away from negative outcomes as they are the first line of defense against the pandemic 23–25. was 171 78.8%, similar to a study confirmed that working with COVID-19 patients had a negative effect on the sleep of physicians ; another study conducted in the same re- gion in 2019 reported that 45.5% of physicians experienced sleepless; however, this percentage reached 68.3% during COVID-19 outbreak . A large report from China agreed with other studies includ- ing HCWs involved in the management of patients with CO- VID-19 showed a higher frequency of mental health issues– particularly insomnia 34%, distress 71.5%, depressive disorders 50.4%, and anxiety disorders 44.6%. Frontline HCWs had an increased risk of developing anxiety and de- pression OR: 1.52 and 1.57, respectively 28,29. A cross-sectional study by Huang and Zhao conducted through a web-based survey screened for the prevalence of mental health issues among HCWs during the current pan- demic; 35% of the participants presented with poor sleep. Sleep disorders and circadian rhythm abnormalities have also been linked to negative influences on the patient-doctor re- lationship. Efficient sleep during the COVID-19 is important; a night of good sleep is generally considered one of the best ways to improve immunity and defend against viruses and diseases . Good sleep had been associated with adequate immune re- sponse and production of undifferentiated naïve T cells and proinflammatory cytokines, which improve the adaptive re- sponse toward different antigens, and a reduction in the sub- sequent liability to infection 16,31,32. In a study by Abdulah and Musa , a longer duration of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients was associated with sleep difficulties, no matter the medical spe- cialty of a HCW, but SQ was worse among female physicians compared with males. Spending too much time up to 3 h daily focusing on the outbreak and following updates and news was associated with anxiety and subsequent sleep dif- ficulties in HCWs . Unsurprisingly, HCWs have poor SQ compared with those in other occupations, a condition that could be mediated by stress during COVID-19 pandemic; the former was reported to have reached a critical frequency up to 70% and was correlated with an increased duration of close contact with suspected or confirmed cases. This finding was also notable in the previous coronavirus outbreaks 33–35. In Toronto, during the first month of SARS outbreak, 11 of reflected by fear, anger, anxiety, insomnia, and worry about the effect of isolation and contact with patients on their fam- ily members and friends. This motivated the hospital to al- low mental health support teams to alleviate these negative impacts, which could have affected later performance post- recovery . In this work, the reported prevalence of poor SQ among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its stressful work Nochaiwong et al. found that negative emotion and psy- chosocial distress may occur among frontline HCWs who are Abbas et al. Sleep Quality Among HCWs During COVID-19 Pandemic directly in contact with the COVID-19 patients; this could be characterized by unintentional mistakes and delays in treat- ment owing to communication failures. This study had some limitations. First, it was cross-sectional; therefore, SQ and medical errors were not assessed for differ- ent time intervals. Second, it could have been influenced by the wave of COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. Finally, other vari- ables that could have affected SQ and medical errors, e.g., depression, anxiety, burnout, and the influence of nursing experience and workload, were not measured. In conclusion, this nationwide online survey reported high prevalence of poor SQ among HCWs in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic, with negative impact on medi- cal errors committed. Being a HCW on the front line of the COVID-19, taking swabs from suspected or confirmed cases, and having a positive comorbid profile were the three independent predictors of poor sleep among study participants.
