BMC Public Health 2019 19:36 Open Access Tobacco smoking and semen quality in infertile males: a systematic review and meta-analysis Pravesh Kumar Bundhun1, Girish Janoo2, Akash Bhurtu2, Abhishek Rishikesh Teeluck2, Mohammad Zafooruddin Sani Soogund2, Manish Pursun2 and Feng Huang3 Abstract Background: Nowadays, the total number of couples visiting an infertility clinic is on the rise. Tobacco smoking is considered one of the major factors leading to male infertility. In this study, we aimed to systematically investigate the impact of tobacco smoking on semen quality in infertile male participants. Methods: Online databases Cochrane Central database of Randomized Controlled Trials and the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE respectively were searched for relevant English publications that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this analysis. The clinical endpoints which were assessed included semen parameters oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and azoospermia, morphological defects of spermatozoa and the hormones involved in reproduction. RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze the data whereby mean difference MD and risk ratios RR with 95% confidence intervals CI were generated to represent the results. Results: Sixteen studies with a total number of 10,823 infertile male participants 5257 smokers and 5566 non-smokers were included. Results of this analysis showed oligozoospermia to be significantly higher in smokers RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05– 1.59; P = 0.02. Morphological defect of spermatozoa MD: 2.44, 95% CI: 0.99–3.89; P = 0.001 was also significantly higher in smokers whereby significant head MD: 1.76, 95% CI: 0.32–3.20; P = 0.02, neck MD: 1.97, 95% CI: 0.75–3.18; P = 0.002 and tail MD: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.35–2.22; P = 0.007 defects were observed. However, smoking did not affected the pH MD: 0.04, 95% CI: − 0.03–0.11; P = 0.30 and motility RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.97–2.09; P = 0.07 of spermatozoa. Additionally, tobacco smoking did not cause any dis-balance in hormones which were involved in reproduction. Conclusions: In conclusion, with reference to the clinical endpoints which were studied in this analysis, tobacco smoking was associated with a lower sperm count and an increase in the number of morphological defects of spermatozoa. However, the pH and motility of spermatozoa as well as the production of hormones which were involved in reproduction were not affected in this population of infertile males.

The effect of tobacco smoking on lung cancer is already well-known . However, other serious health hazards of smoking have not often well Correspondence: 3Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases and Guangxi Key Laboratory Base of Precision Medicine in Cardio-cerebrovascular Disease Control and Prevention and Guangxi Clinical Research Center for Cardio-cerebrovascular Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article been investigated . Not lately, there has been evidence showing tobacco smoking to have shocking impact on reproductive health irrespective of gender status. Nowadays, the total number of couples visiting an infer- tility clinic is on the rise . According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after a duration period of one year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse .

Male infertility approximately 50% of the cases of infertility among couples is grad- ually leading to depression and other psychological out- comes, and this might be potential signs of serious future consequences. The impact of tobacco smoking on semen quality has sel- dom been systematically studied. Therefore, by comparing semen parameters between smokers and non-smokers, we aimed to systematically investigate the impact of tobacco smoking on semen quality in infertile male participants. Methods Electronic databases and searched strategies An electronic search was carried out for English language publications through the Cochrane Central database of Randomized Controlled Trials, the databases of MED- LINE Medical-related publications and EMBASE re- spectively. The terms ‘smoking and infertility’, ‘smoking and male infertility’, ‘smoking and semen’, ‘smoking and sperm’, ‘smoking and young males’, ‘infertility and tobacco smoking’, ‘smoking and male health’, ‘smoking, males and impotence’, ‘smoking and sperm morphology’, ‘smoking and sex’, ‘smoking and sperm count’, ‘smoking and testosterone’, ‘smoking and LH’, ‘smok- ing and FSH’, ‘smoking and prolactin’ and ‘smoking and sperm motility’ were used to find relevant publications. ‘smoking and infertile men’, To improve this search process, the terms ‘males, men, cigarettes, nicotine, tobacco and non-fertile’ were also included one at a time during the search process. In addition, reference lists of suitable articles were also reviewed for relevant publications. Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were based on the following features: a Studies based strictly on infertile male participants; b Studies that compared respective semen parameters in smokers versus non-smokers; c Studies that reported the following endpoints: semen parameters, pH of semen, morphological defects of spermatozoa, types of abnormal structural defects, and hormones which were involved in the functioning of the male reproductive system. Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria were based on the following features: a Studies that consisted of fertile/normal male participants; b Studies that did not compare respective semen parameters in smokers versus non-smokers; c Studies that did not report the above-mentioned endpoints; d Duplicated studies. Endpoints Selective endpoints included: – Oligozoospermia; – Asthenozoospermia; – Teratozoospermia; – Azoospermia; – Morphological defects of spermatozoa: head, neck or tail defects; – pH of semen; – Testosterone level; – Follicle stimulating hormone FSH level; – Luteinizing hormone LH level; – Prolactin level.

BMC Public Health 2019 19:36 Data extraction and review The search of studies was carried out with reference to the PRISMA guideline . Six authors PKB, GJ, AB, ART, MZSS and MP independently reviewed the arti- cles which were considered relevant to this analysis and data were extracted appropriately. The authors’ names, year of publication, the endpoints which were reported, the total number of smokers and non-smokers respectively, age of patients, and the total number of events which were reported in each study were carefully extracted. the study design, Any disagreement which was raised was spontaneously resolved by the seventh author FH. With the exception of the mean age of the partici- pants, other data at baseline were not included in this analysis for two main reasons: – Many original studies did not include risk factors and co-morbidities at baseline; – Baseline features which were reported in certain studies were different from those reported in other studies and a comparison would not have been possible. Statistical analysis The latest version of RevMan software 5.3 was used to analyze the data. This analysis involved both continuous and dichotomous data. Mean and standard deviation SD were used during subgroup analysis whereby pooled mean difference MD was calculated for the continuous data. For dichotomous data, risk ratios RR and 95% confidence intervals CI were generated to represent the results. The statistic Q test and statistic I2 test were used to evaluate heterogeneity . During the subgroup analysis, statistical significance was set at a P value ≤0.05. A fixed effects model I2 50% or a random effects model I2 50% was used based upon the I2 value which was ob- tained during each subgroup analysis. Each study was excluded one by one and a new ana- lysis was carried out each time to observe any significant difference compared to the main results which were ob- tained sensitivity analysis. Ethical approval or board review approval was not re- quired for this type of research articles. Results Search outcomes Electronic search resulted in a total number of 342 arti- cles. After a proper assessment of the titles and ab- stracts, we excluded 285 studies. Fifty-seven 57 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Among the full-text eliminated because: studies were articles, further – They included fertile/normal male participants 8; – They involved infertile couples without specifying the gender 3; – They reported endpoints which were not considered relevant specifically for this analysis 9; – They were duplicated studies 21. Finally, 16 studies 10–25 which satisfied all the inclu- sion and exclusion criteria of this research were included in this analysis Fig. 1. Basic features of the studies which were included in this analysis A total number of 10,823 infertile male participants 5257 smokers and 5566 non-smokers were included in this analysis. The main features of the original studies have been summarized in Table 2. The study design, the participants’ enrollment time pe- riods 1985–2015, the mean age 26.5–40.5 years old, and the total number of smokers 5257 participants and non-smokers 5566 participants have been listed in Table 2. Other characteristics of the participants and the rea- sons for exclusion have been summarized in Table 3. Majority of the patients did not consume alcohol and the minority who consumed alcohol were only moderate consumers. Participants with varicocele, cryptorchidism, infections, genital aspermia, chronic diseases, genital trauma, chromosomal abnormalities were excluded from this analysis Table 3. Oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia Results of this analysis showed oligozoospermia to be significantly higher in smokers RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05– 1.59; P = 0.02 whereas teratozoospermia was not signifi- cantly different RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.96–1.56; P = 0.10 between the smokers and the non-smokers as illustrated in Fig. 2.

BMC Public Health 2019 19:36 Fig. 2 Oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia observed in smoking and non-smoking infertile male participants Discussion As expected, this analysis showed smoking to have a sig- nificant impact on the quantity and quality of sperms in the infertile male participants. Tobacco smoking was as- sociated with a lower sperm count and an increase in the number of morphological defects including head, neck and tail defects of spermatozoa. However, the pH and motility of spermatozoa as well as the hormones which were involved in reproduction were not affected in this population of infertile males. A recent meta-analysis which assessed human semen showed tobacco smoking to have a negative impact on semen parameters . The analysis which consisted of a total number of 5865 fertile and infertile men showed a reduced sperm count and impaired motility in semen samples of these young men. Even though the results Fig. 3 Asthenozoospermia and azoospermia observed in smoking and non-smoking infertile male participants Bundhun et al.

BMC Public Health 2019 19:36 Fig. 6 Hormones involved with reproduction observed in smoking and non-smoking infertile male participants part 1 which were obtained were almost similar with respect to this current analysis, the other analysis included only studies which were published between the years 2010 to 2015, whereas our current analysis included studies which were published even before the year 2010. An- other difference with respect to the current analysis was the fact that there was no language barrier in the other analysis. Moreover, the other analysis also assessed re- sults with reference to the total number of cigarettes which were consumed daily. In contrast to the other analysis, this current meta-analysis assessed specific morphological defects, as well as any dis-balance of the hormones which were involved in reproduction. Another study evaluating the effect of cigarette smok- ing on vital seminal parameters which influence fertility showed smoking to cause impaired motility to a higher extent in comparison to the impairment in sperm count . Men with primary infertility aged between 25 to 40 years were included and a follow-up period of less and above 5 years were considered. A case control study also showed smoking to be asso- ciated with a lower semen concentration, impaired mo- tility of spermatozoa and an increased morphology defect in part reflecting the results of this current analysis. Additionally, an article published by the Canad- ian Society of Clinical Chemists showed that abnormal structural defects of spermatozoa, especially round head defects, were associated with tobacco smoking which might be attributed to increased oxidative stress and in- sufficient scavenging antioxidant enzymes in the seminal fluids of infertile men . Other studies have shown zinc to contribute to this unwanted mechanism in Fig. 7 Hormones involved with reproduction observed in smoking and non-smoking infertile male participants part 2 Bundhun et al.

Other mechanisms have well been explained in previously published reviews 31, 32. Briefly, the possible mechanisms which might be in- volved with the effect of cigarette smoking on semen pa- rameters are: toxic contents found in cigarette smoking might have harmful effects on male germ cells and their developmental processes . Negative effects of nico- tine on semen parameters have also previously been re- ported . Other possible mechanisms might be related to the negative impact of smoking on the 8 nAChR subunits found in human spermatozoa, resulting in smoking-related sperm damage . In addition, dif- ferent proteins Aldoa, ATP5a1, Gpx4, Cs expressed in sperms were significantly altered in smokers . Cigarette smoking was found to also affect Ca2+- ATPase activity of the spermatozoa as well . However, even though clinical research has shown smoking to have an adverse effect on the progressive sperm motility irrespective of the total number of ciga- rettes smoked daily 38, 39, other studies showed no re- lationship between smoking and male infertility . This current analysis showed no significant influence of smoking on testosterone, prolactin, FSH and LH levels. To support this point, Wang et al. showed smok- ing not to be an independent predictor of sex-hormone binding globulin even though a relation or linked was observed between increasing packets of cigarette and sex-hormone binding globulin . Similarly, another study conducted in Taiwan showed no significant differ- ence in LH and FSH levels between smokers and non-smokers showing smoking to have a much higher impact on semen compared to the production of hormones which were involved in the functioning of the male reproductive system. Several alternative methods to stop smoking have been suggested 43–46. However, apart from smoking, other factors such as regular heavy alcohol consumption , certain medications, co-morbidities, autoimmune diseases and other environmental factors might also contribute to abnormalities in semen parameters, morphology and impaired motility and should further be investigated . This interesting research should inspire other scientists to investigate more about the mechanisms, the factors associated with a poor semen quality in smokers; in order for proper actions to be taken in a timely manner to reduce this serious dilemma faced by several young men and couples in our society. This meta-analysis should be considered new for the fol- lowing reasons: it is among the only few meta-analyses to systematically show the impact of smoking on the quality of semen in infertile males. This article might be consid- ered new on the basis of the total number of participants and the number of different endpoints which were analyzed in one particular study. Limitations that a high level of Limitations might be the fact heterogeneity was observed among several of the subgroups analyzing the different endpoints. This could be due to the inclusion of observational data. In addition, several endpoints were analyzed only using a small number of studies. Factors such as alco- hol consumption could have had an influence on the main results. Moreover, the infertility duration, and other associated factors such as genital infections, varicocele, environmental factors were not clearly re- ported in several studies. Bundhun et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:36 Conclusions In conclusion, with reference to the clinical endpoints which were studied in this analysis, tobacco smoking was associated with a lower sperm count and an increase in the number of morphological defects of spermatozoa. However, the pH and motility of spermatozoa as well as the production of hormones which were involved in reproduction were not affected in this population of in- fertile males.
