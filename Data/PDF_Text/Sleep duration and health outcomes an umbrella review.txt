Methods A thorough search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to January, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational and interventional studies were eligible if they examined the associations between sleep duration and human health. Results In total, this umbrella review identified 69 meta-analyses with 11 outcomes for cancers and 30 outcomes for non- cancer conditions. Inappropriate sleep durations may significantly elevate the risk for cardiovascular disease CVD, cogni- tive decline, coronary heart disease CHD, depression, falls, frailty, lung cancer, metabolic syndrome MS, and stroke. Dose–response analysis revealed that a 1-h reduction per 24 hours is associated with an increased risk by 3–11% of all-cause mortality, CHD, osteoporosis, stroke, and T2DM among short sleepers. Conversely, a 1-h increment in long sleepers is associated with a 7–17% higher risk of stroke mortality, CHD, stroke, and T2DM in adults. Conclusion Inappropriate sleep duration is a risk factor for developing non-cancer conditions. Decreasing and increasing sleep hours towards extreme sleep durations are associated with poor health outcomes.

Healthy sleep, including appropriate sleep duration is crucial for the regulation of body metabolism and physiolog- ical functions. A recommended appropriate sleep duration or known as referent sleep duration has been published annu- ally by the National Sleep Foundation NSF panel 1, 2. In recent years there has been a trend world-wide towards fewer sleep hours each night , while an increased prevalence of longer sleep length in some parts of Australia, Finland, Sweden, the U.K., and the USA from 1970 to 2010s has been Vol.:01234567891 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 reported . A complex alteration of sleep patterns has also been observed among individuals due to shift-work and 24–7 occupational requirements, resulting disorders of sleep. Therefore, great importance has been attached to the rela- tionship between sleep duration and health outcomes. Short sleep time has been significantly linked with an increased risk for obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 5, 6, cardiovascular diseases CVD 7–9, coronary heart dis- eases CHD , hypertension 5, 10, and all-cause mor- tality 5, 11–13 in generally healthy populations. Other epidemiologic studies have shown an association between long sleep duration and increased risk for mortality , CVD 9, 14, obesity , incident diabetes mellitus 9, 16, and stroke 9, 17. However, the strength and validity of associations between short and prolonged sleep duration remain weak and incomplete. Furthermore, there is a grow- ing interest in investigating the connection between sleep and cancers. A potential role of sleep duration as a modifier of tumorigenesis and progression of cancers remains con- troversial 18, 19. Numerous epidemiological studies and clinical trials have been conducted to assess the effects of sleep dura- tion 5–22. While these studies were conducted in various different populations, they did not provide a comprehen- sive view of diverse health outcomes 5, 8. Furthermore, dose–response analyses on the relationship between sleep duration and health outcomes have yielded inconclusive results 12, 14, 22. Therefore, a comprehensive evalua- tion is required to evaluate existing evidence from qualified meta-analyses with or without systematic reviews on mul- tiple health outcomes 23, 24. We therefore conducted an umbrella review to synthesize the data on sleep duration and its effects on health outcomes. Experimental section Umbrella review and literature search Compared to a single meta-analysis, an umbrella review is a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses character- izing the most comprehensive critical appraisals of previous published data. An umbrella review is one of the highest levels of evidence synthesis and is gaining traction in multi- disciplinary areas 23, 24. As sleep duration could be meas- ured by hours in the meta-analyses, any systematic reviews without meta-analyses were excluded in this study. Four electronic databases were systematically searched through January, 2021 for articles that investigated the correlation between sleep duration and health outcomes: Embase, Pub- Med, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Sys- tematic Reviews. The following search terms were used: sleep or sleep duration or sleep length or sleep time or sleep deprivation AND systematic review OR meta-analys, using truncated terminology following the SIGN guidance . In addition, the reference lists of eligible articles were also screened for inclusion. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Eligibility criteria Articles with meta-analyses were deemed eligible if inter- ventions were the length of sleep and outcomes were the diverse outcomes related to human beings. No restrictions were imposed on the age of populations, regions, races, or study categories, be they case–control studies, cohort stud- ies, cross sectional studies, or randomized controlled studies. Articles were excluded if they 1 only included a system- atic review, 2 were laboratory studies done in animals, 3 were published in languages other than English, 4 used undefined methodology. Investigations on sleep disruptions 14, 26 such as nocturnal urination, restless legs syndrome, apnea syndromes, were also excluded because researchers only focused on the length of sleep. If an article included more than one health outcome, these health outcomes were assessed separately. When two or more meta-analyses reported data for the same studies, we excluded the dupli- cate articles and selected the one with the largest sample size and the latest date of publication. When subgroup analy- ses in a study reported summary estimate effects of cohort and case–control studies separately, the cohort studies were included in this review because they were generally less sus- ceptible to selection and recall biases. Data extraction The following information returned from the search were independently extracted by two authors JL and DHC: 1 cancer outcomes and non-cancer outcomes, 2 first-author last name and publication year, 3 population, 4 meta- analysis metrics the shortest vs. middle category, the long- est vs. middle category, short vs. reference category, long vs. reference category, 1-h increment or 1-h decrement per day or night, 5 estimated effect relative risk RR, odds ratio OR, hazard ratio HR, with the 95% confidence intervals CIs, 6 number of cohorts/studies, 7 number of cases/total participants, 8 study design cohort, case- control, cross-sectional, randomized controlled trial RCT, 9 type of effects model random or fixed, 10 statistical p value, 11 I2 metric, 12 Cochran’s Q test value, and 13 publication bias. Definition of sleep duration Reference or appropriate sleep duration is conceptualized as a time point or a time period with a cutoff dividing the 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 sleep duration into short and long sleep duration. However, the exact reference sleep time from different source papers lacks definitional consensus. In our review, the duration of reference sleep in adults was defined based on each source paper. For papers investigating children or adolescents less than 18 years old, reference sleep duration was adopted according to the SHF criteria 1, 20. In view of the fact that non-adults 18 years old of different ages require differing sleep durations , the reference sleep time of the largest population in the specific study was selected as the representative standard by that source paper. Most articles embodied short and long sleep duration in comparison to reference time, while some papers also contained the longest or shortest sleep duration versus reference sleep duration in addition to the two typical pairs, which were also included in our study. When more than one sleep category more or less than the reference sleep duration were found simulta- neously in a study, all qualified time categories that met the requirements were combined to be conceptualized as the short or long sleep duration category. Furthermore, when a study reported sleep durations both per night and per 24 h, the former was selected. For dose–response analysis, two types of the comparisons were in line with the records. One was characterized as 1-h reduction in those who sleep less than reference duration and the other was 1-h increment in people with longer sleep duration. Quality assessment and evidence grading The methodological quality and risk of biases of included meta-analyses were assessed by the Assessing the Methodo- logical Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 AMSTAR-2 , which featured an overall rating based on weaknesses in crit- ical domains than the original AMSTAR. We assessed the quality of evidence for unique outcome through the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evalu- ation GRADE working group classification system. Data analysis The most-adjusted summary estimates and 95% confi- dence interval CI calculated through fixed or random effects methods were selected from each meta-analysis in the review. Publication bias and the heterogeneity were respectively assessed by Egger’s test, I2 metric, together with Cochran’s Q test when available. For heterogeneity and publication bias as well as other applicable tests, P 0.05 was deemed as significance. Results Overall, 414 articles from databases were identified, out of which 198 articles were excluded after duplicates and 109 excluded after screening titles and abstracts. The remain- ing 216 articles yielded 69 meta-analyses after full-text screening Fig. 1. The included articles covered 11 out- comes for cancers and mortality as well as 30 outcomes for non-cancer conditions Fig. 2. The cancer and mortality outcomes are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Tables 3, 4, and 5 show the associations between sleep duration and non- cancer problems in different populations. Full versions of the total summary data with regard to cancer and non-cancer outcomes including the definition of sleep duration are available in the Table S1 to Table S5, Supplementary data. AMSTAR2 scores and GRADE classifications are shown in Tables 6 and 7. The complete rating of AMSTAR2 scores and GRADE classifications relating to health outcomes are presented from Table S6 to Table S9, Supplementary data, respectively. Furthermore, we illustrated the nonlinear dose–response relationship between sleep duration and some specific out- comes Fig. 3. Cancer and mortality outcomes Long and short sleep were not associated with cancers, including ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , colorec- tal cancer , and breast cancer . The same outcomes applied to the dose–response analysis on sleep duration and risk of cancers Fig. 3a . Lung cancer was the only cancer found to be significantly associated with an elevated risk of mortality in short 1.21, 1.10–1.33 and long duration sleepers 1.65, 1.36–2.00 . Long sleep duration was significantly linked with an increased risk of all-cause mortality 1.39, 1.31–1.47 and cancer-related mortality 1.05, 1.02–1.08 , while neither were influenced by short sleep. Extreme sleep durations both predicted the substantial increase in all- cause mortality, with the shortest duration sleepers hav- ing a 13% increase 1.13, 1.10–1.17 and the longest hav- ing a 35% increase 1.35, 1.29–1.41 . Regarding the dose–response analysis in short sleep duration, 1-h incre- ment more than reference time and 1-h decrement less than reference time per day or night were statistically significant parameters on all-cause mortality Fig. 3b, c . Mortality in some specific diseases was also explored in part in this review. An hour increment per day significantly increased the stroke mortality by 17% 1.17, 1.13–1.20; Fig. 3d in the general population . Otherwise, no asso- ciations were found between sleep duration and the risk of 1 3 Fig. 1 Flowchart of the selec- tion process Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 Fig. 2 Map of outcomes related to sleep durations 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 A N . % . m o d n a R A N . % .

Neurological outcomes Inappropriate sleep durations were significantly associ- ated with cognitive decline among adults . Risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease AD were increased by long sleep duration, both reaching significant statis- tics, representing 1.77, 1.32–2.37 and 1.63, 1.24–2.31 respectively , while short sleep did not affect incident disease rates. Longest and shortest sleep durations had a statistical effect on the risk of dementia and AD. The longest sleep duration doubled the risk of suffering from AD 2.19, 1.08–4.46 compared to the reference sleep time . In children, short sleepers were at higher risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD 1.28, 1.16–1.41 . From another perspective, the cerebral vascular disease, also known as stroke, was affected by inappropriate sleep durations. Short sleep in adults showed an increase of 32% of incident stroke 1.32, 1.18–1.47 , and long sleepers were at even higher risks than those with short sleep 1.48, 1.31–1.68 . In addition, dose–response analysis corroborated the previous con- clusion. General populations with long sleep duration met an increased risk of 17% 1.17, 1.14–1.20 of inci- dent stroke with every 1-h increment while short sleepers increased 7% 1.07, 1.02–1.12 per hour decrement per night Fig. 3e . Metabolic outcomes Short and long duration were not significant indicators for dyslipidemia, including increases of triglycerides, total cho- lesterol, low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol, or the decrease of high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol , and the occurrence of fatty liver disease . However, long sleep was associated with an increased risk of metabolic syn- drome MS 1.25, 1.09–1.43 in adults and osteoporosis among middle-aged and elderly women 1.22, 1.06–1.38 compared with referent sleep hours. In one study there was a protective effect from obesity 0.99, 0.89–1.11 . Sleep durations less than 7 to 8 h and 7 h per day were linked with 19% higher risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver dis- ease NFLD 1.19, 1.04–1.36 , 41% higher risk of obesity and overweight 1.41, 1.18–1.69 , 34% higher risk of T2DM 1.34, 1.24–1.46 , and 19% higher risk of metabolic syndrome 1.19, 1.05–1.36 in adults. A meta-analysis including 214,773 subjects reported that long sleep time was associated with 7% risk of gaining weight in adults but this finding did not achieve statistical significance 1.07, 0.98–1.17 .

There was evidence that short sleep was not related to gestational diabetes mel- litus GDM 1.24, 0.91–1.68 . Conversely, adults with longer sleep time were significantly at higher risk of GDM 1.19, 1.04–1.35 . Other outcomes There is some evidence that sleeping less or more than refer- ence duration significantly elevated the risk of falls in adults and frailty in elderly adults 51, 52. Otherwise, no relation- ship was observed between short sleep duration and chronic kidney disease CKD , but there was a 47% increased risk 1.47, 1.26–1.72 of proteinuria in adults associated with suboptimal sleep duration . Heterogeneity Of all the studies, 9 studies presented a high degree of het- erogeneity with I2 75%; 44 meta-analyses presented mod- erate level of heterogeneity, with I2 ranging from 25 to 75%; However, 6 meta-analyses did not report the heterogeneity. 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 Fig. 3 Nonlinear dose–response analyses of sleep duration and risk of cancer in adults a, all-cause mortality in adults b, c, stroke mortality in general population d, stroke in general population e, osteoporosis in general population f, T2DM in general population g, CHD in general population h. CHD, coronary heart disease; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus Publication bias Of all meta-analyses, 5 reported significant publication bias by Egger’s test including all-cause mortality, ADHD, GDM in adults, and obesity/overweight in children. Of the included articles, 62% were not linked to a significant pub- lication bias and 30% did not report the publication bias. 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 AMSTAR2 scores and GRADE classification The results of AMSTAR 2 of the included meta-analyses are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Among the studies focusing on cancers and mortality, about 10% of the studies were classified by GRADE into “moderate,” 17% were classified into “low,” and 73% were “critically low.” In studies related to non-cancer field, about 1%, 21%, and 78% studies were rated as “moderate,” “low,” and “critically low.” Most stud- ies did not meet the requirements that studies need for com- prehensive reporting of the prior design, excluded assays, and funding information in detail as well as accounting for bias in individual studies. The detailed results of each item of AMSTAR 2 for the included meta-analyses are available in Table S6 and S7, Supplementary data. As for the quality of outcomes concerning cancers and mortality, about 67% were graded as “very low,” 30% graded as “low,” and 3% graded as “moderate.” With respect to non- cancer outcomes, 79%, 16%, and 5% were rated as “very low,” “low,” and “moderate” regarding quality of evidence, respectively. None were stratified as “high” because most of the meta-analyses contained studies bearing serious risk of bias and imprecision while lacking plausible confounding analysis, magnitude, and dose–response ingredients. The detailed information about GRADE is shown in Table S8 and S9, Supplementary data. Discussion This umbrella review is the first systematic review of meta- analyses of associations between duration of sleep and health consequences in population-based studies. According to the recommendations from the expert panel of the NSF 1, 2, the reference sleep duration for infants is between 12 and aged children between 9 and 11 h. For adults, a sleep dura- tion of 7 to 9 h and for older adults 7 to 8 h are considered appropriate. At present, maintaining an appropriate sleep duration has become a critical public health issue and mas- tering the effect of inappropriate sleep durations on health outcomes constitutes a key success factor for promoting general health. From this umbrella review, we observed a strong nonlin- ear U-shaped or V-shaped association for the relationship between sleep duration and CVD, cognitive decline, CHD, depression, falls, frailty, lung cancer, MS, and stroke among adults. Yet, no associations were found between sleep dura- tions and the risk of cancers except lung cancer, cancer- specific mortality, CHD mortality, dyslipidemia includ- ing high LDL cholesterol, fatty liver disease, high total cholesterol, high triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol. Short sleep duration was linked with 19–47% higher risk of ADHD, NFLD, proteinuria, and T2DM in general popula- tion, 16% higher risk of hypertension in adults, and 55–58% higher risk of mood deficits and obesity. Furthermore, the most recent studies found that long sleep duration was asso- ciated with an increased risk by 63–77% of all-cause demen- tia and AD in general population as well as 5–37% all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality, GDM, and osteoporosis in adults. Extreme sleep durations including shortest and longest sleep duration were more likely to be associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality, AD, cognitive decline, cognitive disorders, CHD and T2DM in general population, and CVD in adults. We observed a J-shaped dose–response relationship revealing that 1-h reduction per day or night was associated with 3–11% higher risk of all-cause mortality, CHD, osteoporosis, stroke, and T2DM among short sleepers. Apart from that, a 1 h increment per day or night also linearly increased the risk of stroke mortal- ity, CHD, stroke, and T2DM by 7–17%. To a large extent, neurologic outcomes were signifi- cantly influenced by sleep durations, though a fair number of the studies had moderate heterogeneity that may not be balanced by the population, region, sex, or other determi- nants. Reference sleep duration 7 h/night or 7–8 h/night in adults is associated with decreased dementia, cognitive decline, and cognitive disorders 37, 54, but the effects of inappropriate sleep durations are controversial. Some stud- ies alleged that only long or short sleep time was linked to cognitive diseases. Two large studies from China in a significant U-shaped and V-shaped association between sleep duration and cognitive function 57, 58. From this umbrella review, cognitive decline was affected by both long and short sleep durations. In 2019, a meta-analysis containing 7 studies for dementia and 6 for AD suggested that longer sleep time was associated with a higher risk of dementia and AD by 77% and 63%, respectively. However, shorter sleep duration was insignificantly associated with a 20% 1.20, 0.91–1,59 increased risk of dementia and 18% 1.18, 0.91–1.54 increased risk of AD . Furthermore, short sleep time represented a hazard of ADHD for children under 18 years old. There are several plausible mechanisms for the effect of sleep duration. First, short sleep time was associated with cerebral white matter atrophy or lesions 59, 60, a direct cause for the cognitive disorders. Secondly, deprived and prolonged sleep contributed to neuroinflammation of the cerebral structure . An elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α level caused by insufficient sleeping is asso- ciated with longer reaction times, memory problems, and damaged attention . Furthermore, both short and long sleepers were found to be associated with an elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin IL-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein hsCRP 62, 63. 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 IL-6 and hsCRP can negatively influence synaptic plastic- ity and neurogenesis and are predictors for AD and vascu- lar dementia as well as ADHD in children 64, 65. Third, inappropriate sleep durations may involve the process of amyloid clearance . Appropriate clearance of amyloid is the premise of normal function of the brain. It is widely acknowledged that excessive β-amyloid peptide Aβ triggers amyloid cascade theory and consequently results in AD. The accumulation of Aβ, stimulated by sleep deprivation may in turn reciprocally aggravate sleep disruption, commenc- ing a vicious cycle of cognition disorders . Consistent stimulation of inflammation factors and the recruitment of immune cells activated by long hours of sleep may to some extent give rise to cognition impairment and AD 67, 68. In terms of cardiovascular disorders, sleep durations were tightly linked to a wide range of diseases including CVD, CHD, and hypertension. Inadequate sleep may boost the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and there- fore stimulate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system to increase catecholamines 69, 70. Accumulating catechola- mines may contribute to the constriction of blood vessels and onset of hypertension. Thus, a vicious circle may be formed as a stimulated sympathetic nervous system in turn shortens sleep time. On the other hand, magnesium is thought be a trace element essential for human as well as a physiologic calcium antagonist to decrease vascular tension. Intracellu- lar magnesium may decrease with severe sleep deprivation . Thus, inadequate sleep with low levels of intracellular magnesium may act as a potential indicator for hyperten- sion. Although from this umbrella review, longer sleep time was not significantly linked with the risk of hypertension in adults, other studies have demonstrated that long sleep duration was a risk factor for the onset of hypertension 72, 73. Mechanisms are not yet fully understood, though there are many hypotheses that long sleepers include subjects with obstructive sleep apnea, fatigue, depression , and low socioeconomic and employment status . As such, longer sleep duration may not necessarily signal better sleep quality. Interestingly, one study reported that patients with chronic heart failure did not have better sleep efficiency as the self-reported sleep time increased . Conversely, when using objective measurement like polysomnography, only objective short sleep duration or poor sleep quality were associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes . Higher risk of CHD and CVD may result from short or long sleep duration, increases or decreases in sleep time, and extreme sleep durations. The development of cardio- vascular disorders may not only include the direct effect of sleep duration change but also include altered insulin sen- sitivity , glucose intolerance , impaired glycemic control 9, 79, growth hormone metabolic activities 7, 9, and fluctuation of leptin, ghrelin, and cortisol secretion 75, 80. Further exploration into the relationship between long sleep duration and cardiovascular outcomes should focus on a the accompanying symptoms with long sleep rather than durations alone and b the difference between subjective and objective sleep durations. Meaningful associations between sleep duration and cancer-related outcomes were relatively few. Most meta- analyses did not demonstrate a significant association between inappropriate sleep durations and the oncogenesis and progression of the carcinoma 19, 29–31. However, this umbrella review did demonstrate a slightly positive associa- tion that long sleep duration was a risk factor for lung cancer. In a synthetic analysis curtailing 1,500,000 study individu- als from 13 countries , the RRs of colorectal and lung cancer were 1.08 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 and 1.11 95% CI: 1.00–1.22 in long sleepers, which was consistent with our conclusions. Mechanisms underlying these associations are under- explored, yet the melatonin hypothesis may play a part in oncogenesis of the cancers. Melatonin has a pivotal role in the circadian cycle, and the level is proportional to the length of sleep 19, 82. Shorter sleep means a greater possibility of nighttime activities and a greater chance of exposure to light at night, subsequently resulting in decreased melatonin levels . Melatonin plays an anti-cancer role experimen- tally by suppressing the initial phase of cell proliferation and stimulating differentiation and apoptosis, whereas decreased or insufficient melatonin may promote tumor growth 83, 84. Furthermore, melatonin is intricately linked with sex hormone levels . For example, inappropriate melatonin secretion may induce estrogen levels to increase, which has been reported to be a contributing factor to the aggres- siveness of breast cancer . The combined mechanisms mentioned above may disproportionately trigger the tumo- rigenesis of gastrointestinal , colorectal cancers , and the progression of hormone-related cancers including breast , prostate , and ovarian cancers . Addi- tionally, short sleep duration together with long sleep dura- tion is potentially associated with circadian rhythm, mood changes, activities alteration, and occupational demands, which also take part in the oncogenesis and progression of cancers. Short sleep time considerably contributes to exces- sive caloric intake , having an indirect effect on human insulin metabolism. Impaired glucose metabolism may elevate levels of insulin‐like growth factor‐1, a modifier for the increased risk of colorectal cancer 91, 92. Inappropri- ate sleep durations may stimulate ulcers and gastrointestinal dysfunctions and subsequently predispose individual to a higher risk of gastrointestinal cancer . Of note, people may be inclined to switch their sleep patterns including the length of sleep. Fluctuations and alterations may therefor confound the exact relationship between sleep durations and the risk of cancers. 1 3 Sleep and Breathing 2022 26:1479–1501 Due to the fact that sleep disorders and circadian rhythm may not be easily and comprehensively quantified by hour or degree, we did not include them in the umbrella review. Alternatively, we reported sleep duration both as a night metric and day metric for dose-analysis calculation. Nor- mal sleep–wake rhythms and healthy sleep behaviors play a pivotal role in maintaining and boosting functioning . The effect of sleep disorders and circadian rhythm may exert their influence through impaired immunity , increased inflammation and oxidative stress , dysfunctional cata- bolic process, and hormone release 96, 97. In a study in which some workers were assigned to work on a night shift work, their waketime blood pressure and average systolic and diastolic blood pressure was higher than the control group . The disruption of circadian rhythm may also attenuate the cardioprotective vagal modulation . Fur- thermore, the misalignment of circadian rhythm may accom- pany the loss of PER2 and the increase of β-catenin protein in breast cancer and intestinal cancer . In 2015, a study reported that individuals suffering from insomnia, parasom- nia, or obstructive sleep apnea were at higher risk of devel- oping nasal cancer, oral cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer than patients without sleep disturbances . Strengths and limitations An umbrella review is thought to represent one of the high- est levels of synthesis of comprehensive evidence . There has been no previous attempt to conduct an overview assessing whether or not sleep duration has an effect on health and well-being. This newly developed approach helps to assess any harm that may be related to inappropriate sleep duration and provides future direction in sleep investigation. We utilized the up-to-date AMSTAR2 appraisal tool and GRADE classifications to assess the quality and validity of the included studies. However, possible limitations should be acknowledged in the interpretation of this umbrella review. First, based on the definition of sleep duration, there may be variations of objec- tive and subjective sleep durations. Night shifts and sleep disorders as mentioned were confounding factors potentially contributing to bias. Secondly, we did not include sleep qual- ity in our umbrella review. Sleep quality was assessed by questionnaires of various types and could not be separated from sleep duration. Lack of dose–response analysis on quality of sleep is another consideration. Third, AMSTAR and GRADE classifications of the mentioned studies were relatively low. Low AMSTAR grades were explained by the fact that many included meta-analyses did not satisfy the principal criteria in terms of their description of excluded studies and funding sources. On the other hand, more than half of the studies included in this umbrella review were meta-analyses of observational studies which contributed to low GRADE classifications due to their low-quality evi- dence. Fourth, the number of cases in each subgroup was often ambiguous. This was caused by the phenomenon that source papers usually reported the total numbers of patients rather than the exact numbers in subgroups. Also, stud- ies on cancer-related outcomes were not able to develop a consensus despite the fact that potential mechanisms are being discovered gradually. These findings suggest that more research is needed to address the the association between sleep duration and lung cancer mortality. Conclusion Inappropriate sleep durations exhibit considerable asso- ciations with outcomes of non-cancer conditions. Long and short sleep duration increased the risk for cognitive diseases and other chronic diseases. Increased sleep hours in long sleepers and decreased hours in short sleepers did more harm to patients than good . Future large and robustly designed studies may continue to clarify the effect of sleep duration on different aspects of human health.
