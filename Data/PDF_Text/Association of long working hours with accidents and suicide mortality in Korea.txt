Association of long working hours with accidents and suicide mortality in Korea. Scand J Work Environ Health. 2020;465:480–487. doi:10.5271/sjweh.3890 Objectives The deleterious health effects of long working hours have been previously investigated, but there is a dearth of studies on mortality resulting from accidents or suicide. This prospective study aims to examine the association between working hours and external-cause mortality accidents and suicide in Korea, a country with some of the longest working hours in the world. Methods Employed workers N=14 484 participating in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey KNHANES were matched with the Korea National Statistical Office’s death registry from 2007–2016 person-years = 81 927.5 years, mean weighted follow-up duration = 5.7 years. Hazard ratios HR for accident N=25 and suicide N=27 mortality were estimated according to weekly working hours, with 35–44 hours per week as the reference. Results Individuals working 45–52 hours per week had higher risk of total external cause mortality compared to those working 35–44 hours per week HR 2.79, 95% confidence interval CI 1.22–6.40, adjusting for sex, age, household income, education, occupation, and depressive symptoms. Among the external causes of death, suicide risk was higher HR 3.89, 95% CI 1.06–14.29 for working 45–52 hours per week compared to working 35–44 hours per week. Working 52 hours per week also showed increased risk for suicide HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.03–13.64. No statistically significant associations were found for accident mortality. Conclusions Long working hours are associated with higher suicide mortality rates in Korea. Key terms depression; injury; karoshi; KNHANES; Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; mental health; occupational; overwork; work hour; working time; work time. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries, Korea ranked as one of the top nations for longest working hours between 2008 and 2018 1. In 2018, the annual working hour average in Korea was 1993 hours, while the working hour average for the OECD countries collectively was 1734 hours per year 1. Previous studies have established an associa- tion between long working hours and adverse outcomes, including coronary heart disease 2, stroke 3, mental health disorders 4, 5, reproductive health problems 6, and accidents 7. As working hours in East Asian coun- tries Japan, Korea, and Taiwan are generally longer than those of western countries, deaths related to overwork called karoshi, usually from cardiovascular disease, represent a growing social concern 8. Recently, suicide among overworked employees has drawn urgent atten- tion in both Japan and Korea 9, 10. However, studies on working hours and suicide are limited to descriptive case series 11, 12, with one notable exception of a longitudi- nal study in the UK 13. Although the mechanism linking long working hours and suicide is not yet fully under- stood, a number of studies have examined the association between long working hours and depressive symptoms or suicide ideation 4, 5, 14. The deleterious impact of long working hours on mental health status is an obvious pathway connecting long working hours and suicide. Besides cardiovascular disease and suicide, accidents are another potentially fatal outcome associated with long working hours. Fatigue and sleep loss potentially mediate the association between long working hours Correspondence to: Inah Kim, Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul 04763, Korea.

However, the majority of studies on working hours and accidents have remained cross-sectional and/or used self- reported accidents as the outcome 7. On the contrary, a recent prospective study using national registers to assess accidents concluded there was no association between long working hours and accidents 17. Thus, although some previous studies support an adverse impact of long working hours on suicide and accident mortality, this association is not well estab- lished by longitudinal data. In addition, to our knowl- edge, the association between long working hours and suicide or accident-related deaths has not been previ- ously reported in the East Asian context. Accordingly, the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the relationship between long working hours and accident mortality/suicide in a Korean work- ing population based on nationwide longitudinal data. Methods Study population Our data were derived from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey KNHANES con- ducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention KCDC between 2007–2015. These data were then matched with death registry data compiled by the Korea National Statistical Office KNSO from 2007–2016. The survey used a multi-stage, cluster- sampling design based on the National Census Registry; hence, statistical analyses of this survey were based on sample weights assigned to sample participants. Among the 73 353 participants in KNHANES, 66 384 partici- pants provided consent to link their data to the death registry. We restricted the subjects to employed work- ers by excluding the economically inactive population 37 702, employers and self-employed workers 8965, and unpaid family workers 2105. Employers and self- employed workers were excluded due to their ability to control their working hours; despite their working hours being even longer than employed workers, they are not subject to working hour regulations 18. Additionally, we excluded the following individuals: those 18 years, individuals with 15 work hours per week or missing information on working hours, and covariates. After these exclusions, our analytic cohort comprised 14 484 men and women. The selection process of the study population is presented in figure 1. Ascertainment of outcomes The cohort dataset was matched with the death registry Figure 1. Flow chart illustrating the process of creating the cohort. Weighted frequencies showed in .

As all deaths in Korea are reported to the KNSO by law, coverage of the death registry can be considered complete. Information on the specific cause of death according to the Korean Classification of Disease KCD and date of death was provided by KNSO. The KCD is compatible with the International Classification of Diseases-10 ICD-10. Deaths from total external cause V01–Y98, subsets including accidents V01–V99; transport accidents, and W00–X59; other external causes of accidental injury, and intentional self-harm X60– X84 were used as our outcomes. During an average 5.2 person-years of follow-up, 56 participants died from total external causes. Among them, 25 individuals died from accidents 13 from transport accidents and 12 from the other accidents and 27 died from suicide. Assessment of working hours Working hours were measured by responses to a question on the KNHANES asking: “How many hours do you usu- ally work per week, including overtime?” Working hours were classified into four groups: i 15–34, ii 35–44, iii Scand J Work Environ Health 2020, vol 46, no 5 Lee et al 45–52, and iv 52 hours per week. The top code of 52 hours per week was based on the maximum permitted working hours according to the Labor Standard Act in Korea 19. This Act has defined standard working hours as 40 hours per week, with extensions up to 52 hours per week permitted with the worker’s consent. However, working on weekends was not subject to regulation until 2018, therefore enabling workers to work 52 hours per week legally if they worked on a Saturday or Sunday. was derived. More KNHANES sampling weight details can be found elsewhere 23. Ethical approval The Institutional Review Board of the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed and approved the pilot study of the KNHANES-linked cause of death data IRB No. 2018-07-01-P-A. Covariates Age, sex, household income, education, occupation, and depressive symptoms were included in our regression models as possible confounders. Socioeconomic status SES, including occupation, is associated with both accident and suicide mortality 20. Depressive symp- toms are a well-established risk factor for suicide and could be related to accidents as well 21. These covari- ates were collected during interviews in the KNHANES. Monthly household income was equalized for house- hold size gross monthly household income divided by the square root of household size and participants were divided into four groups according to quartile of stan- dardized household income by survey year. Occupation was coded into nine categories according to the Korean Standard Classification of Occupation 22, and we col- lapsed these into six groups managers and profession- als; office workers; service and sales workers; agricul- tural, forestry, and fishery workers; plant and machine operators and assemblers; and elementary occupations. The response to the question, “Have you experienced serious sadness or hopelessness that restricts your daily life continuously for 2 weeks in the last year?” was used to define depressive symptoms, with an affirmative response indicating a positive for depressive symptoms. Statistical analysis Cox proportional hazards models were developed to estimate hazard ratios HR with 95% confidence inter- vals CI for the association between working hours and deaths from accidents and suicide. In the Cox models, person-days were calculated from the initial date of par- ticipation in the KNHANES until either the date of death including deaths from non-accidental causes or 31 December 2016, whichever occurred first. The analytic model included age, sex, education, occupation, house- hold income, and depressive symptoms as covariates. We applied the integrated survey weights, calculated by averaging weights over sampled years, because we used data from multiple waves of the survey. The sampling weights for each wave of the survey was calculated and provided by the KCDC to ensure the survey data could be inflated to the population level from which the sample Scand J Work Environ Health 2020, vol 46, no 5 Results The distribution of working hours according to sample characteristics is presented in table 1. Of these par- ticipants, 35.6% worked 35–44 hours per week, 24.7% worked 45–52 hours per week, and 24.9% worked 52 hours per week. Working for 52 hours per week was prevalent among men 30.9%, those with middle lower household income 29.1%, those with middle school education 30.5%, and plant and machine operators and assemblers 39.1%. The number of cases and participant mortality rates are shown in table 2. The accident mortality rates were 16.4, 21.1, 46.7, and 36.3 per 100 000 in the 35, 35–44, 45–52, and 52 hours/week groups, respectively. Sui- cide rates of 12.5, 12.0, 51.2, and 52.8 per 100 000 were observed in the 35, 35–44, 45–52, and 52 hours/week groups, respectively. The majority of deaths from acci- dents 24 cases were among men; there was only one case among women. Suicide rates were also higher among men 46.8 per 100 000 than women 10.2 per 100 000. Table 3 shows the results from the Cox regressions examining the association between working hours and mortality due to accidents and suicide. Proportional hazards assumptions were met. In the model adjusting for sex, age, household income, education, occupation, and depressive symptoms, participants working 45–52 hours/week showed elevated total external cause mor- tality risk HR 2.79, 95% CI 1.22–6.40 compared to the reference group reporting 35–44 hours/ week. Men and women working 45 hours/week showed higher suicide mortality risk 45–52 hours: HR 3.89, 95% CI 1.06–14.29; 52 hours: HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.03–13.64 compared to the reference group. No statistically sig- nificant associations were found for accident mortality.

Those working 52 hours showed a higher HR, but the result was not statistically signifi- cant. The risk of total external cause mortality is mainly driven by the excess risk of suicide because suicide showed a significantly elevated HR in the groups work- ing 45–52 and 52 hours. On the contrary, those work- ing 52 hours showed a lower risk of accidents com- pared to the standard working hour group. This opposite direction of association between accidents and suicide among the 52 hours group suggests that mortality from these causes might have different pathways. Accidents In previous studies 24, 25, an adverse impact of long working hours among hospital workers including young doctors on traffic accidents have been reported odds ratio 2.3 for extended shift 24 hours, 95% CI 1.6– 3.3. In one case-crossover study 16, there was a strong trend in increased rate ratios RR for traffic accidents and shift duration RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52–1.62 for 8 hours/day, RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.45–35.8 for 12 hours/ day. For work-related accidents, several studies have also revealed the association between long working hours and increased self-reported or objectively con- firmed work-related injury 26, 27. One case-crossover study showed that the risk for work-related injury in workers who worked 64 hours per week was 1.88 times greater than among those who worked ≤40 hours 28. A probable explanation for the association between long working hours and accidents is fatigue due to lack of sleep 24, 29. The current study’s results were not consistent with these previous findings. The HR for accident mortality was lower among the 52 working hour group than the standard working hour group, although the differences were not statistically significant, and the CI was wide. A number of reasons could underlie this discrepancy. First, in the current study, there was a wide time gap between the assessment of working hours and accidents, while previous works measured working hours at the time of accidents 16, 24, 25. Sleep loss and fatigue can be more related to long working hours immediately preceding the accidents. Second, the outcome of the current study was mortality from accidents, while most previous studies used experiences of accidents as an Scand J Work Environ Health 2020, vol 46, no 5 Lee et al Table 2.

In fact, a previous study using a similar design to ours census-based longitudinal study in UK found lower or similar risk of all accidental mortality for men working 55 compared to 35–40 hours/week among professional/ managers, self-employed, and routine occupations 13.

Scand J Work Environ Health 2020, vol 46, no 5 Although extensive research has been conducted on the association between long working hours and men- tal health including depressive symptoms and sui- cidal ideation, very few studies have focused specifi- cally on completed suicide. In Korea and Japan, where overwork-related suicide is a growing social concern, descriptive characteristics of suicide cases compen- sated as work-related mortality have been reported 11, 12. The daily working hours of 22 work-related suicide cases in Japan ranged from 10–16 hours 11. In a Korean report, "chronic long working hours" was the second most prevalent reason, following "acute stressful events", for approved cases of compensable work-related mental disease, which included suicide Working hours and accidents and suicide mortality 12. One UK-based longitudinal study examining the association of long working hours and completed suicide showed a 1.23–1.24 times higher risk in the 55 hour/ week group compared to the 35–40 hour/week group among professionals/managers, but the results were not statistically significant 13. Elevated risk of suicide might be due to the well- established association between long working hours and poor mental health 4, 5. However, suicide rate was not associated with depressive symptoms at our data baseline. This could be caused by the time gap between the survey and the events of suicide or depression. Indeed, a longitudinal study in the UK, which reported no depressive symptoms at baseline, showed a higher risk of incident depression among participants with long working hours after a 5-year follow-up 4. A second explanation for the association between long working hours and suicide could be the deleterious effects these long hours have on relationships with fam- ily and friends. Social isolation and family conflict are widely reported risk factors for suicide 30, and long working hours have been shown to increase work–life conflict 31, 32. According to a 2018 psychological autopsy report of the Korean Psychological Autopsy Center, among the 103 suicide cases, occupational stress was second only to mental health issues as a primary stressor. 33. In this report, qualitative analysis of 52 employed workers’ pathways to suicide revealed that their main occupational stressors included change of work, work demands, and relationships in the workplace 33. Long working hours are closely related to work demands, and work demands could affect the relationships between supervisors and coworkers. Low SES is also a risk factor for suicide. A previous study in Korea revealed that suicide risk is 2.28 times higher in Medicaid recipients than in 10th-decile highest income individuals 34. In the current study, the lowest household income group showed markedly higher suicide rates 97.9 per 100 000 than other groups 20.1–37.7 per 100 000. Since working hours could be confounded by SES, we built analytic models adjusting for SES. However, we found that the association persisted in the adjusted model, suggesting that long working hours are associated with suicide risk, regardless of SES. Limitations of our study must be mentioned as well: the number of cases was relatively small; therefore, the CI for HR remained wide. Especially for women, accident mortality was extremely rare. Due to the small number of the cases, caution is warranted in generaliz- ing the results of the current study. Working hours were measured based on self-report and collected only once at baseline. Since working hours are time-dependent variables, we cannot rule out the misclassification of exposure during follow-up. This possibility of non- differential working hour misclassification could have biased the results toward the null. Other time-varying covariates such as depressive symptoms could have changed during follow-up as well. However, due to the scarcity of repeated assessments of mental health status, we were unable to conduct a mediation analysis ie, to check whether changes in depressive symptoms medi- ated the association between long working hours and suicide. Nevertheless, the lack of mediation analysis does not affect overall risk estimates of working hours for outcomes. Further analysis of working hour effects on mortality from accidents and suicide with a sufficient number of cases with longer follow-up periods, larger cohorts, and additional measures of working hours and covariates may follow in the future. Concluding remarks In conclusion, our study shows that workers who work long hours 44 hours per week have a higher risk of suicide in Korea.

Its strengths are that the subjects were drawn from a nationwide sample rather than from selected subgroups. Additionally, cause of death was determined from validated records. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the impact of long working hours on accident and suicide mortality in Korea. 1. OECD.
