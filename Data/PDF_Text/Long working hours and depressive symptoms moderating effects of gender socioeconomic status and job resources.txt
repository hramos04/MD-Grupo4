International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Long working hours and depressive symptoms: moderating effects of gender, socioeconomic status, and job resources Kanami Tsuno1,2 Norito Kawakami4 · JSTRESS Group · Ichiro Kawachi1 · Akiomi Inoue3 · Saki Nakai2 · Takumi Tanigaki2 · Hikaru Nagatomi2 · Received: 23 February 2018 / Accepted: 13 January 2019 / Published online: 12 March 2019 © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019 Abstract Purpose Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found inconsistent associations between working hours and depres- sive symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible moderators of this association, using data from a large-scale cross-sectional survey. Methods A total of 16,136 Japanese employees men 83.5%; women 16.5% responded to a self-administered questionnaire inquiring about overtime working hours during the previous month and depressive symptoms Center for Epidemiologic Stud- ies Depression scale, as well as moderating factors including gender, age, marital status, socioeconomic status, commuting time, sleeping hours per day, job control and worksite social support Job Content Questionnaire, neuroticism Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire Revised, and social desirability Social Desirability Scale response rate, 85%. We conducted sequential regression analyses to investigate the main effects and interaction effects of all moderating variables. Results The association between overtime working hours and depressive symptoms was significantly moderated by gender interaction effect: β = 0.03, age β = − 0.02, manager β = 0.03, sleeping hours β = − 0.02, job control β = − 0.03, and neuroticism β = 0.02. Among workers engaged in 80 + hours of overtime, higher depressive symptoms were reported by women, younger employees, non-managers, employees with low job control, low worksite social support, and high neu- roticism. A significant main effect of long overtime working hours on depressive symptoms was also observed even after controlling for all independent variables β = 0.02. Conclusions Long overtime working hours is associated with depressive symptoms. We also found significant heterogeneity in the association according to employee characteristics, which may explain the inconsistent findings in previous literature.

Although average total working hours have been declining, daily working hours are actu- ally on the rise among certain groups such as full-time male workers Kuroda 2010. Epidemiologic research indicates that long working hours are a cause of various physical health problems. For example, two systematic reviews Bannai and Tamakoshi 2014; Kivimäki et al. 2015 showed that long working hours ≥ 41 h/week or ≥ 55 h/week are associated with high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality. In contrast, several systematic reviews or meta-analyses Vol.:01234567891 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 have reported inconsistent findings for the association between working hours and mental health problems such as depression Bannai and Tamakoshi 2014; Fujino et al. 2006; Sparks et al. 1997; Van der Hulst 2003; Virtanen et al. 2018; Watanabe et al. 2016. Specifically, although Bannai and Tamakoshi 2014, Sparks et al. 1997, and Watanabe et al. 2016 found a positive association between working hours and depression, Fujino et al. 2006 and Van der Hulst 2003 found inconsistent results. However, the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis Virtanen et al. 2018 found an association between long working hours and the onset of depressive symptoms. Additionally, they found a stronger association in Asia than in European countries and no association in North America and Australia. However, this study did not reveal the reason for this regional dif- ference nor what moderating factors affect this association. Inconsistencies in the relation between long work hours and depression may stem from the potential heterogeneity of the association according to employee characteristics. For example, one possible modifier of the association between long working hours and mental illness is gender. Several studies reported that the association between overtime work and depressive disorder for women was greater than in men Artazcoz and Gutiérrez 2012; Shields 1999. Among work- ers reporting the same working hours, it is likely that female workers—especially married women—are also engaged in more domestic labor compared to male workers, as captured by the concept of the “double shift” Milner et al. 2015; Spurgeon et al. 1997. In Japan, gender differences in the division of household labor are even more marked than in many western societies. For example, working married women perform domestic chores for 5 h, while the average working married men report less than 1 h even if they have children under 6 years old Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 2016. Since there are only 24 h in a day, long work hours will be inversely correlated with sleeping time. Insufficient sleep could potentiate the adverse effects of long working hours by increasing negative affect Kahn-Greene et al. 2007. Indeed, Nakata 2011 reported that combination of long work and short sleep posed the strongest risk for depressive symptoms among full-time employees. A similar argument applies to commuting time. Hence, sleep or commute time is a poten- tial moderator of long working hours and depression. Another possible reason for inconsistent results is the buffering role of job resources. According to the job demands–control model by Karasek 1979, the combina- tion of high job demands and low job control generates the highest levels of worker stress. This situation which is called job strain was reported in a systematic review as a strong and consistent predictor for onset of clinical depression Madsen et al. 2017. Thus, job control is critical when considering the impact of overwork on depressive symptoms Hino et al. 2015. Additionally, as suggested by the iso-strain model Johnson and Hall 1988, worksite social support supervisor support and coworker support may also buffer the associa- tion between long working hours and depressive symptoms. Thus, the effect of longer working hours on mental health is likely to be moderated by the availability of these job resources Bannai and Tamakoshi 2014. Socioeconomic status SES, which is defined by educa- tional status, income, or occupational status, is also robustly lined with health outcomes such as mortality or depression and anxiety Glymour et al. 2014. Although there is no clear gradient in the association between SES and long work hours, a census-based longitudinal study revealed that the adverse effect of long working hours on mortality from car- diovascular disease was more marked in individuals engaged in low SES occupations O’reilly and Rosato 2013. Thus, the adverse impact of long working hours on depressive symptoms might be observed among low SES workers, pos- sibly because of low job control. Finally, the association between long working hours and depressive symptoms might be moderated by the worker’s personality characteristics. Neuroticism is strongly associ- ated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, while introver- sion is moderately associated with depressive symptoms Jylhä and Isometsä 2006. On the other hand, social desir- ability has been negatively correlated with depression Cole 1988. In summary, the purpose of this study was to investigate a comprehensive range of possible moderators, i.e., gender, age, marital status, socioeconomic status SES, commut- ing time, sleeping hours per a day, job control, worksite social support, neuroticism, and social desirability, of the association between overtime working hours and depres- sive symptoms, using data from the large-scale cross-sec- tional survey Kawakami et al. 2004. We hypothesized that women, younger employees, lower SES employees, as well as workers with longer commuting time, shorter sleeping hours, fewer workplace resources e.g., job control or social support, higher neuroticism, and lower social desirability are more likely to report depressive symptoms than men, older employees, higher SES employees, as well as workers with shorter commuting time, longer sleeping hours, larger workplace resources, lower neuroticism, and higher social desirability in situations involving severe overtime working hours. Methods Participants The present study was conducted using the baseline sur- vey of the Japan Work Stress and Health Cohort Study 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 JSTRESS Study which was conducted from April 1996 until May 1998 and recruitment strategies were as previously described Kawakami et al. 2004. A questionnaire was dis- tributed to 29,471 workers at nine manufacturing compa- nies and factories, and a total of 22,770 questionnaires were returned average response rate, 85.2%. After excluding participants with at least one missing response for variables relevant to the study, data from 16,136 respondents 13,467 men and 2669 women were analyzed in this study. The study procedure was reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, before the surveys were conducted. Measures Overtime working hours per month All study participants were full-time workers and their scheduled working hours were 40 h/week. Overtime working hours exceeding scheduled working hours were measured by asking participants average overtime working hours per month. First, we used overtime working hours as a continu- ous variable, but we also classified them into three groups 45 h, 45–79 h, and ≥ 80 h/month to compare depressive symptoms scores among sub categories. This classification is generally used in the Japanese society and research, and equal to 51.25 h, 51.25–59.75 h, ≥ 60 h/week e.g., Hino et al. 2015. Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms were measured by Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression CES- D scale Radloff 1977; Shima et al. 1985. This scale con- sists of 20 items asking participants to rate how often they experienced symptoms associated with depression over the past week. The response options were from 0 “rarely” or “never” to 3 “most” or “almost all of the time”. The Japa- nese version of the CES-D has a good reliability and validity Shima et al. 1985. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coef- ficient for internal consistency was 0.82. SES and demographic characteristics Gender, age, marital status, and SES variables education and occupation were assessed in the questionnaire. Marital status was classified into currently married and unmarried, which consists of never married, divorced, or widowed. Edu- cation was dichotomized into under high school graduates and higher education. Occupation was classified into man- ager, white-collar, and blue-collar. Commuting and sleeping time One-way commuting time and average sleeping hours per a day were assessed in the questionnaire. One-way commut- ing time was classified into two groups with median time of the participants: short ≤ 40 min and long 40 min. Average sleeping hours per a day during previous 1 year were grouped into short ≤ 6 h and long ≥ 7 h because the median daily sleeping hours in this sample are 7 h. Job control and worksite social support Job control and worksite social support were measured using the Japanese version of the Job Content Questionnaire JCQ Karasek 1985; Kawakami et al. 1995. Job control consists of skill discretion six items and decision authority three items total Cronbach alpha for nine items = 0.79. Social support consists of supervisor support four items and cow- orker support four items total Cronbach alpha for eight items = 0.84. Response options ranged from 1 “strongly disagree” to 4 “strongly agree”. Neuroticism Neuroticism was measured using scales from the short ver- sion of Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire Revised SEPQ- R Eysenck et al. 1985. This scale consists of 12 items with a yes/no response yielding a total score 0–12: a high score reflects the degree of nervousness or anxiety experienced by the respondent for neuroticism or the degree of participation and interaction with others in social situations for extrover- sion. The Japanese version of SEPQ-R was proven to be reli- able and valid Hosokawa and Ohyama 1993. Respondents were classified into two groups: low score 0.0–5.0 and high score 5.1–12.0. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for internal consistency was 0.77. Social desirability Social desirability was measured using the Japanese version of the Social Desirability Scale Crowne and Marlowe 1960; Kitamura and Suzuki 1986. This scale consists of ten items with a yes/no response. A high score reflects the high degree of social desirability. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coef- ficient for internal consistency was 0.53. Statistical analyses We conducted sequential regression analyses to investigate the association of long overtime working hours on depres- sive symptoms. All continuous variables were grand-mean centered to avoid multicollinearity when entering interac- tion effects into the model. In Step 1, we first entered long 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 overtime working hours, demographic characteristics, SES, commuting time, and sleeping hours Model 1. In Step 2, job resources and personality traits were additionally entered Model 2. Finally, interaction terms gender, age, marital status, education, manager, blue-collar, commuting time, sleeping hours, job control, worksite social support, neuroti- cism, social desirability × working hours were additionally entered into the model Model 3. Subsequently, two-way ANCOVA and post hoc test Bonferroni were also con- ducted on the significant interaction effects to see the score differences of depressive symptoms. The level of signifi- cance was 0.05 two tailed. The statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 23.0J for Windows. Results Characteristics of participants Table 1 shows the demographic and occupational charac- teristics, overtime working hours, job resources, personality traits, and depressive symptoms scores of respondents in this study. Most of them were men 83.5%, married 77.6%, high school graduates 52.9%, and blue-collar workers 47.2%. The average overtime working time was 27.9 h. The prevalence of depressive symptoms when using cut-off point of 16 + was 24.0% in this study. Main effects of overtime working hours and characteristics on depression A significant main effect of long overtime working hours on depression was observed after adjusting for gender, age, marital status, education, occupational status, commuting time, and sleeping hours in Model 1 Table 2. In Model 2, the main effect of long overtime working hours on depres- sion remained significant, while main effects were also found for all other variables including job resources and personality traits. Interaction effects of long overtime working hours and depressive symptoms Significant interaction effects of overtime hours and age, woman, manager, sleeping hours, job control, and neuroti- cism were observed for depressive symptoms Table 3. On the other hand, we did not find significant interaction effects of overtime hours and unmarried p = 0.417, no college p = 0.960, blue-collar p = 0.257, long commuting time p = 0.877, worksite social support p = 0.633, or social desirability p = 0.808. Table 4 and Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show score differ- ences of CES-D among the groups which showed significant interaction effects. We found that women, younger work- ers 30–49 years, workers in non-managerial white-collar occupations, and employees reporting low job control were more likely to report depressive symptoms when experienc- ing ≥ 80 h overtime working hours. Employees with high neuroticism were also more likely to experience depressive symptoms under conditions of long working hours. On the other hand, short-sleepers were more likely to have depres- sive symptoms regardless of how many hours they had worked overtime. Discussion In this large-scale cross-sectional study, we found a signifi- cant main effect of long work hours on depressive symp- toms. However, we also found significant heterogeneity in the relation according to gender, age, occupational sta- tus, sleeping hours, job control, and neuroticism. Women, younger employees, non-managers, employees with low con- trol or high neuroticism are more likely to have depressive symptoms when they suffer from heavy overwork, compared to men, older employees, managers, employees with high control or low neuroticism, respectively. In other words, if an employee is a man, ≥ 50 years old, manager, having high job control, and having low neuroticism, he/she is less likely to have depressive symptoms even though working ≥ 80 h overtime per a month. The results of the current study revealed that the effect of severe overtime working time is heterogeneous, which helps to understand why some existing literature had inconsistent results on the association between working hours and depression. The result differences highly depend on the characteristics of participants. In the current study, long overtime working hours them- selves were one of the predictors of depressive symptoms. This is consistent with the systematic reviews or meta-anal- yses, which reported a positive association between long working hours and depression Bannai and Tamakoshi 2014; Sparks et al. 1997; Virtanen et al. 2018; Watanabe et al. 2016. Additionally, the severity of depressive symptoms was obvious in working overtime 80 + h in the current study. This is also in line with the studies which showed that risk of psychiatric morbidity predominated in longest working hour group such as ≥ 60 h/week Kato et al. 2014, 49–100 h/ week Kleppa et al. 2008, or ≥ 280 h/month Nagashima et al. 2007. Working overtime ≥ 80 h means employees work at least 60 h/week or 12 h/day. Sleeping, bathing, or eating time are part of employees’ free time so that if they work longer their free time will be reduced, resulting in less time to relax or recover efficiently. Both men and women who work overtime ≥ 80 h had significantly higher depressive symptoms compared with those working less hours; however, women had much higher 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Table 1 Demographic and occupational characteristics, over time working hours per month, job resources, personality traits, and depressive symptoms among Japanese employees N = 16,136 Variables Demographic characteristics Gender Men Women Age years Marital status Married Unmarried SES Educational status Junior high school/high school graduate College/university/graduate school graduate Occupational status Manager White-collar Profession Engineer Clerical job Blue-collar Service worker Craft worker Machinery operator Physical worker Others Over time working hours/month Less than 45 h 45–79 h One-way commuting time Less than 40 min Average sleeping hours/day Average SD n 40.1 9.2 27.9 30.9 38.2 7.9 13,467 12,528 10,395 12,950 10,413 Variables scale Job control JCQ Worksite social support JCQ Neuroticism EPQ-R Social desirability SDS Depressive symptoms CES-D Range 24–96 12–60 0–12 0–10 0–60 Average SD 66.2 11.1 45.2 7.17 5.4 3.3 4.5 2.0 12.3 6.7 % 83.5 16.5 77.6 22.4 64.4 35.6 13.7 39.3 13.9 13.9 11.5 47.0 1.1 11.5 20.7 8.7 5.1 80.3 14.4 5.4 35.5 64.5 40.8 59.2 Cronbach’s α 0.79 0.84 0.77 0.53 0.82 SD standard deviation, JCQ Job Content Questionnaire, EPQ-R Eysenck Personality Questionnaire- Revised, SDS Social Desirability Scale, CES-D Center for Epidemiologic Scale for Depression depressive scores than men when they worked ≥ 80 h over- time, as expected. This finding is consistent with previous studies Artazcoz and Gutiérrez 2012; Kleppa et al. 2008; Shields 1999. Although the current study did not ask par- ticipants about their household labor, it seems reasonable to assume that women had more responsibility for domes- tic chores, child care, and elderly care compared to men Milner et al. 2015; Spurgeon et al. 1997. Shimazu et al. 2013 reported that the association between family-to-work or work-to-family conflict and psychological distress among wives is greater than among husbands, which also supports out results. Moreover, long working hours are hazardous for pregnant women, because especially if associated with heavy lifting and prolonged standing, it may also increase 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Table 2 Sequential regression analyses with depressive symptoms N = 16,136 Model 1 Model 2 b SE β p b SE β p Step 1 Overtime working hours Age Gender woman = 1, man = 0 Marital status unmarried = 1, married = 0 Education no college = 1, college = 0 Manager manager = 1, non-manager = 0 Blue-collar blue-collar = 1, others = 0 Commuting time 40 min = 1, ≤ 40 min = 0 Sleeping hours ≤ 6 h = 1, ≥ 7 h = 0 Step 2 Job control Worksite social support Neuroticism Social desirability Adjusted R2 ΔR2 F change 0.01 − 0.03 0.35 1.96 0.92 − 1.60 1.13 0.51 0.77 0.00 0.01 0.15 0.14 0.14 0.17 0.13 0.11 0.11 0.03 − 0.04 0.02 0.12 0.07 − 0.08 0.08 0.04 0.06 0.000 0.000 0.017 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.060 115.380 0.00 − 0.01 − 0.56 1.26 0.82 − 0.85 0.63 0.30 0.45 − 0.06 − 0.16 0.90 − 0.09 0.00 0.01 0.13 0.12 0.12 0.15 0.11 0.09 0.09 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 − 0.02 − 0.03 0.08 0.06 − 0.04 0.05 0.02 0.03 − 0.09 − 0.17 0.44 − 0.03 0.026 0.022 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.001 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.326 0.266 1594.173 b partial regression coefficient, SE standard error, β standard partial regression coefficient, R2 p 0.01 coefficient of determination Table 3 Sequential regression analyses with depressive symptoms: interaction effects N = 16,136 Model 3 b SE β p 0.00 0.00 − 0.02 0.034 0.03 0.014 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.049 0.01 0.01 − 0.01 0.00 − 0.01 n.s. 0.00 0.00 Step 3 Overtime hours × age Overtime hours × woman Overtime hours × unmarried Overtime hours × no college Overtime hours × manager Overtime hours × blue-collar Overtime hours × long commuting time Overtime hours × short sleeping 0.01 0.00 0.03 0.004 hours Overtime hours × job control Overtime hours × worksite social − 0.00 0.00 − 0.03 0.000 0.00 0.00 − 0.00 n.s. support Overtime hours × neuroticism Overtime hours × social desirability Adjusted R2 ΔR2 F change 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.003 0.328 0.003 5.265 b partial regression coefficient, SE standard error, β standard partial regression coefficient, R2 p 0.01 coefficient of determination the risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight Palmer et al. 2013. Thus, the results of the current study indicate long working hours impose a heavy burden on women and reducing overtime working hours may contribute to gender equality and occupational safety. Occupation and age were significant moderators of the relationship between long working hours and depressive symptoms. In the present study, managers and employees aged ≥ 50 years were less likely to report depressive symp- toms even when they worked ≥ 80 h overtime, while blue- collar employees had higher depressive symptoms regardless of how many hours they worked overtime. This finding is in line with previous studies Glymour et al. 2014; O’reilly and Rosato 2013; Rawshani et al. 2016 and can be explained by job control, since low SES workers have less flexibility in the choice of overtime work or autonomy. In other words, workers in higher positions have more discretion over the content and hours of work. In this sample, the average age of managers was older 45.6 vs. 39.3 years old and their score for job control was much higher than among non-managers 74.6 vs. 64.9. The traditional Japanese companies are nota- ble for promoting workers based on seniority i.e., age, or duration of tenure in the company—as opposed to a system whereby talented employees can leap-frog over more senior colleagues. As O’Reilly and Rosato 2013 reported, men, managers, and own-account workers tend to work longer hours. Since workers with high job control tend to be more 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Table 4 Two-way interaction between overtime and other covariates on depression with post hoc tests results: adjusted means of CES-D score Overtime hours × gender Man Woman Overtime hours × age 30–39 40–49 Overtime hours × occupation Manager White-collar Blue-collar Overtime hours × sleeping hours Short sleeping hours ≤ 6 Long sleeping hours ≥ 7 Overtime hours × job control Low job control 0.0–66.0 High job control 66.1–96.0 Overtime hours × neuroticism Low neuroticism 0.0–5.0 High neuroticism 5.1–12.0 Overtime hours per month 45 45–79 ≥ 80 F p 4.82 0.01 12.2a 12.3c 12.1b 9.9d 13.6ab 21.2cd 1.02 0.411 12.6 12.6a 11.9c 11.7 13.3 12.3b 12.0c 11.4 10.3a 11.8c 10.6b 12.1d 13.0 12.5 14.3 14.2ab 13.4cd 11.9 11.9ab 13.7cd 13.6 1.83 0.118 12.5a 12.0c 13.0a 11.4c 9.8 14.9a 16.3 0.01 12.8b 11.5d 14.0ab 13.3cd 13.2b 11.3d 15.5ab 12.4cd 9.7 14.8b 10.0 16.9ab 4.42 0.012 9.23 0.01 Adjusted for gender, age, education, marital status, occupation, commuting time, and sleeping time abcd p 0.05; p 0.05, p 0.01 from post hoc tests Bonferroni highly engaged in their work Bakker et al. 2007, many of them contribute longer hours on a voluntary basis and thus they may experience less psychological stress. According to a model put forward by Shimazu and Schaufeli 2009, workaholism working excessively and working compul- sively is positively associated with distress, while work engagement vigor, dedication, and absorption is protec- tively associated with psychological distress. Employees with low job control and low worksite social support were more likely to suffer from depressive symp- toms, and the score difference was more marked among those working 80 + overtime working hours. This is con- gruent with job demands–control support model itself and those reporting buffering effects of job resources on health outcomes Bakker and Demerouti 2007; Hino et al. 2015. As we discussed in the previous paper Hino et al. 2015, this finding may be explained by the concept of worktime control WTC, which refers to the self-determination of worktime aspects including control over whether, when, and how many hours one should work overtime Nijp et al. 2012. The results of the current study also suggest that the amount of social support from supervisors or coworkers may influence depression risk regardless of how many hours they work overtime. Although we did not find a significant inter- action effect of overtime working hours and worksite social support on depressive symptoms, our findings indicate that reducing long working hours and improving job control and worksite social support reduce depressive symptoms. High neuroticism was a risk factor of depressive symp- toms and its effect was more pronounced when employees work ≥ 80 h overtime. This pattern is consistent with the finding that neurotic traits are strongly related to depression Jylhä and Isometsä 2006. We did not find an interaction effect of overtime working hours and social desirability on depressive symptoms but did a main effect, which is in line with the study that reported a negative association between social desirability and depression Cole 1988. The interaction of overtime working and sleeping time was significant, while a significant interaction effect of overtime working hours and commute time was not found on depressive symptoms. As many studies reported Kahn- Greene et al. 2007, the results of the current study suggest 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Fig. 1 Overtime hours × gender Fig. 2 Overtime hours × age that sleep deprivation would associate with depressive symptoms because short-sleepers had higher depressive symptoms than long-sleepers even among employees who worked overtime for 45 h. Our study results are also in line with Nakata’s 2011 study that reported combination of long work and short sleep had a strongest risk for depres- sive symptoms among full-time employees. This might be because sleep may moderate the association between long work hours and depressive symptoms, and also short sleep is often a consequence of depression. 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Fig. 3 Overtime hours × occu- pation Fig. 4 Overtime hours × sleep- ing time Some possible limitations of our study should be con- sidered. First, a causal relationship cannot be determined because this is a cross-sectional study. A prospective study is required to elucidate the causal relationship between overtime working hours and depressive symptoms and its moderators. Second, overtime working hours were meas- ured by self-report, which may cause recall bias. Informa- tion of overtime working hours should obtain from com- pany data or from employees on a daily basis to avoid this bias. Finally, our sample was only from male-dominated manufacturing companies in Japan; therefore, there may be some degree of some health worker effect among female employees and generalization of the findings should be done with caution. 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Fig. 5 Overtime hours × job control Fig. 6 Overtime hours × neu- roticism Conclusion Long overtime working hours were a predictor of depres- sive symptoms, independent of employee characteristics, commute or sleeping time, job resources, and personality traits. However, severity of depressive symptoms was greater among women, younger employees, non-manag- ers, employees with low job control, employees with low worksite social support, and employees with high neuroti- cism when they suffer from long overtime working hours. 1 3 International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 2019 92:661–672 Acknowledgements The following are members of JSTRESS the Japan Work Stress and Health Cohort Study group: Takashi Haratani National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan, Fumio Kobayashi Aichi Medical University, Japan, Masao Ishizaki Kanaz- awa Medical University, Japan, Takeshi Hayashi Hitachi Health Care Center, Japan, Osamu Fujita Kariya Toyota General Hospital, Japan, Yoshiharu Aizawa Kitasato University, Japan, Shogo Miyazaki Kanda Christian Clinic, Japan, Hisanori Hiro University of Occu- pational and Environmental Health, Japan,Takeshi Masumoto Kim- itsu Health Service Center, Japan, Shuji Hashimoto Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Japan, and Shunichi Araki Saitama Occupational Health Promotion Center, Japan.
