Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 Open Access Impact of long working hours on health based on observations in China Liming Chu Abstract Background: Health should be a key focus in considerations of long working hours. Little is known about for which groups of people working longer hours is more harmful to their health. Additionally, the definition of long working hours varies slightly due to country differences in working hours systems. Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between long working hours and the self-rated health SRH level, taking into account gender and educational differences. Method: Data were collected from two waves 2016 and 2018 of the China Family Panel Studies CFPS. A total of conditional mixed process CMP regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Furthermore, I conducted a stratified analysis by gender and education groups. Result: This study observed a negative association between long working hours and SRH. Compared to other education groups, labor with long working hours had a more negative impact on the SRH of those with higher education. Long working hours had a more negative influence on the SRH of male workers. In contrast, no clear association was found among female workers. Conclusion: This study estimates SRH of those with long working hours in China. Among workers, long working hours have a negative impact on the health of workers with college degrees or beyond. One possible explanation is that they do not exercise, their diet is unreasonable, and their working conditions involve chronic exposure to computer radiation. The negative health effects of long working hours on males are four times greater than those on females. This study provides valuable insights into the health of the workforce, working time regulations and overtime rules. Keywords: Long working hours, Self-rated health, CMP, China Background In the era of fast economic development, the quality of the labor force has drawn widespread attention, and in this regard, health is an important factor. In recent years, excessive labor has slowly become common due to the continuously extended working hours of workers, which have a direct impact on their health level and harms economic development and social stability. A better Correspondence: School of Labor Economics, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing 100070, China scholarly understanding of this topic appears to be ur- gently needed. China published the Health China 2030 plan, which aims to provide every citizen with health services by 2030. China’s basic medical insurance system has reached the goal of covering both urban and rural residents, meeting their medical needs, and providing a strong guarantee for the improvement of workforce health. Understanding the impact of labor market per- formance on health holds great significance for explor- ing the influencing factors in the health level of the labor force. © The Authors. 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 Workforce health can be measured in two ways. The first is the self-assessment of health status, which can more intuitively reflect the health status of individuals, show a closer relationship with studies on individual choices such as labor force participation and retirement, and acquire data more easily 1–3. The second is the construction of comprehensive indicators. Regarding ac- tivities of daily living ADLs, little variation in young populations is shown . The Short Form 36 SF-36 health survey questionnaire , Euroqol-5D , Health Utilities Index HUI , and Quality of Well-Being which includes objective indicators Scale QWB based on individual health status, are also limited. Reflecting an individual’s subjective assessment of his or her health status, quality of life indicators are very rigor- ous in their data requirements. Subjective measures, such as self-assessed health SAH or satisfaction with one’s own health, provide valuable insights because they might respond more quickly to changes in working time than objective indicators, such as the frequency of doc- tor visits or absences from work due to sickness. Since the 1980s, working hours have been a matter of debate and have become a focal issue in Canada, France, Germany, the United States, the United King- dom, and other Western countries 9, 10. As a uni- versal phenomenon among most organizations and companies, longer working hours are motivated by the possibility of job advancement or better employ- ment opportunities and higher wages. According to efficiency wage theory, the cost of unemployment is positively correlated with the number of working hours, whose increase is an important indication of work effort but can be harmful to the health of the population above a certain level, with some degree of overtime being associated with high levels of stress and health effects accumulating over time 11–15. In general, related studies emphasize that health suf- fers from underemployment and, in particular, un- employment 16–20. In addition, an extensive literature documents that long working hours are closely related to chronic diseases, poor mental health and unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption 21–25. Epidemiological research has shown that long working hours affect the risk of cardiovascular diseases 26–29, stress, chronic fatigue , the probability of stroke , anxiety, sleep quality, all-cause mortality, smoking, hypertension, self-perceived health, health be- haviors and mental health status 32, 33. Regarding long working hours, similar results have been obtained by other studies, including myocardial infarction , injur- ies, poor physical health, alcohol consumption , physical inactivity , and depression . In general, it has been found that long working hours are detrimen- tal to health . While studies conclude that additional working hours have adverse consequences for health, they predominantly focus on specific symptoms. Mild differences between occupations in labor and heterogeneity in time commitment can have different ef- fects on health, with more resources and energy invested in career development leading to more distinct occupa- tional identities and highly complex jobs producing more significant effects on health . Gender differ- ences also exist in the effects of long working hours on health. Mainly due to the differences in the social roles and socioeconomic status of different gender groups, in- voluntary overwork is positively associated with the poor mental health of males but can lead to the poor physical health of females . Long working hours can be detri- mental to both individual and spousal health. Despite the significance of long working hours, a meta-analysis conducted by Sparks and Cooper dis- covered that a variety of health syndromes are slightly positively correlated with long working hours based on a relevant literature review. The research perspectives were mostly analyzed based on one aspect, such as the relationship between long working hours and the health status of a certain group of migrant workers, while het- erogeneity analysis focused on special groups and occu- research on the pational association between long working hours and health or combined medical insurance has been conducted. The issue of long working hours is quite important in every society, which thus highlights the need to investigate the connection between long working hours and the health of workers. Moreover, the link between long working hours and health is rarely studied from the perspective of different genders or educational levels. types. No subsequent Given the insufficient understanding of some details of this issue, this study investigated the association between long working hours and self-rated health SRH using data from the China Family Panel Studies CFPS. This study aimed to examine 1 the definition of long work- ing hours and 2 whether long working hours are asso- ciated with SRH, with particular attention to differences in gender and education. Data and methods Data Involving 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the data adopted in this paper were sourced from the CFPS and four main questionnaires, namely, community, family, adult, and child questionnaires, which can be used for research on individual microbeha- viors. In this paper, the 2016 and 2018 data were com- bined for a panel data analysis based on the nonfarm labor force aged 18–65 as subjects. A total of 6972 valid samples were obtained after the deletion of missing, ex- treme, and unreasonable values. Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 Measurement of the variables Measurement of the health level of the labor force In this study, the outcome variable was the SRH level. The question “What do you consider your health to be?” was chosen to measure the health level of the labor force based on the design of the CFPS questionnaire. The re- “relatively sponse options were “healthy” and “very healthy”, which were healthy”, assigned a value of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the average SRH level of the respon- dents was fair. “unhealthy”, “fair”, Measurement of long working hours In this paper, the core explanatory variable was long working hours. Based on the design of the CFPS ques- tionnaire, the question “How many hours a week does this job typically involve?” was chosen to measure work- ing hours. Referring to the related Chinese and inter- national research and according to the working time restrictions in the Labor Law of China, this paper used a working time of more than 50 working hours a week as the standard for identifying long working hours. Articles 36, 38, and 41 of the Labor Code stipulate that a worker should not work more than 8 h a day and 44 h a week on average. Employers should ensure at least 1 day of rest per week for workers. Employers may extend work- ing hours, which should generally not exceed 1 hur per day for production and business purposes, as suggested by the worker and trade union; additionally, if there is a need to extend work hours for special reasons, em- ployers should not extend working hours more than 3 h per day and more than 36 h per month to guarantee the Table 1 Definition of variables and descriptive statistics Variables Definition physical health of workers. As a result, the reference standard working time is 44 h, and the maximum weekly working time can be 44 + 1 6 = 50 h in view of produc- tion and operational needs. Therefore, in this paper, a working time of more than 50 h a week for workers was regarded as overwork, which is consistent with the standard of measuring overwork in China and inter- nationally. As illustrated in Table 1, the labor force works 52 h a week, exceeding the working hours standard. Measurements of the covariates To reduce the underlying bias in the statistical model caused by omitted variables, the empirical analysis con- trolled for variables including gender, age, educational level, personal income, marital status, smoking, drinking, exercise frequency, and medical insurance participation, which are specifically defined in Table 1. Ordered Probit model This paper focused on the relationship between long working hours and the physical health of the labor force, and the explanatory variable, SRH, as multi-ordered data, was unsuitable for ordinary least squares OLS es- timation. As an extension of the probit model dealing specifically with cases in which the interpreted variable is sorted data, the following model was set: cid:1 cid:3 healthi;t ¼ F βlongworkinghoursi;t þ γX i;t þ εi;t where healthi, t represents the dependent variable; β re- fers to the intercept term; Xi, t means a series of control Self-rated health Unhealthy = 1,fair = 2,relatively healthy =3, healthy = 4, very healthy = 5 Long work hours Whether working time is less than 50 h Gender Age Income Level of education Male = 1,female = 0 age Annual personal income Junior secondary and below = 1, senior secondary/technical school/vocational high school = 2, junior college and above = 3 8.42 1.84 4.03 0.88 Marital status At the wedding =1,otherwise = 0 Whether to smoke or not Smoking = 1,otherwise = 0 Whether to drink or not Three times a week in the past month = 1 0.80 0.05 0.07 Exercise Frequency How many times a week do you do exercise 2.16 Whether you have health insurance or not Health Insurance = 1, No = 0 0.90 0.40 0.22 0.25 2.92 0.30 Full sample N = 6972 Working hours are less than 50 h N = 3419 Working hours not less than 50 hN = 3553 Mean Standard Mean Standard Mean Standard Error Error Error 3.21 1.05 3.23 1.01 3.19 1.10 0.51 0.29 0.5 0.46 — — — — 0.26 0.44 0.33 0.47 36.74 11.06 36.38 11.03 37.08 11.09 9.06 2.15 0.77 0.04 0.06 2.40 0.91 3.55 0.89 0.42 0.19 0.24 2.93 0.29 7.80 1.54 4.36 0.77 0.82 0.06 0.08 1.93 0.89 0.39 0.24 0.27 2.89 0.31 −0.0519 0.090 0.150 0.000 −0.0275 0.000 0.00772 0.035 −0.0182 0.334 0.0519 0.182 −0.138 0.043 0.133 0.022 0.0264 0.000 −0.0662 0.168 YES YES 0.168 0.310 CMP − 0.0681 0.047 0.139 0.000 − 0.0254 0.000 0.00718 0.039 −0.0163 0.334 0.0481 0.169 −0.129 0.035 0.123 0.024 0.0246 0.000 −0.0276 0.606 YES YES 0.834 0.000 ERM − 0.0729 0.050 0.151 0.000 −0.0274 0.000 0.00764 0.045 −0.0180 0.324 0.0516 0.176 −0.138 0.039 0.132 0.026 0.0263 0.000 −0.0297 0.607 YES YES 0.834 0.000 0.106 0.000 Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 Table 2 Relationship between long working hours and individual health level variables; γ represents for the coefficient of the influence of these control variables on the health level of the re- spondents; εi, t is a random error term; and F ∙ denotes a nonlinear function that takes the following form: cid:1 cid:3 cid:2 i;t F y ¼ : y cid:2 ≤ C1 i;t cid:2 i;t M M C j−1 J y cid:2 i;t ≤ C2 where ycid:2 i;t represents the latent variable, satisfying ¼ βworkhouri;t þ γX i;t þ εi;t cid:2 y i;t Long working hours Gender Age Income C1 C2 … CJ-1 are tangent points and parameters Level of education cid:3 Marital status Smoking Drinking Exercise Medical insurance Year Province sigma2u cons n cons to be estimated. cid:1 P yi;t cid:1 P yi;t cid:1 P yi;t cid:1 P yi;t cid:3 cid:3 cid:3 cid:3 ¼ 1jX i;t ¼ 2jX i;t ¼ 3jX i;t ¼ JjX i;t C1 cid:2 i;t cid:1 ¼ P y cid:1 ¼ P C1 ≤ y cid:1 ¼ P C2 ≤ y cid:3 cid:3 cid:2 i;t cid:2 i;t C2 C3 cid:1 ¼ 1−P Cn−2 ≤ y cid:2 i;t Cn−1 cid:3 If the random error term is in the normal distribution, the probability of a higher health level of the labor force will increase. A causal relationship may exist between long working hours and other variables such as health. For example, a person will find it difficult to work if he or she is not in a healthy state. To solve the endogeneity of long working hours and to identify the econometric model, whether the average working time of industry is less than 50 h was used as the instrumental variable of working time. Whether the working time in the same trade is too long will affect the working time of individuals but have no impact on the health of individuals. However, in this paper, health is a discrete variable, and two-stage least squares based on a continuous variable may fail . Therefore, conditional mixed process CMP regression analyses and extended regression models ERMs that can handle endogeneity were used to re-estimate the baseline regression model. Results The regression results of the relationship between long working hours and the health level of individuals are re- ported in Table 2. Columns 1–3 are the ordered pro- bit oprobit, ERM, and CMP regressions results, which suggest that, all other things being equal, long working hours were negatively correlated with health across the entire sample; these results were significant at the 5– 10% levels.

The analysis above shows that the health level of the labor force is constrained by long working hours, but in- dividuals’ behavior is generally dominated by their be- liefs, value orientation and attitudes towards realistic interests. Different cultures form different ideas and life- styles, which ultimately exerts a direct or indirect impact on people’s health. Thus, the impact of long working hours on the health level of the labor force varies by gender and education. Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 Table 3 divides the sample by educational level and gen- der and further reports the relationship between long working hours and the health level of the labor force among different samples grouped by gender and educa- tional level. From the perspective of differences in educa- tional level, long working hours have a more significant impact on the SRH of workers with a college degree or above and a limited impact on the SRH of workers with other levels of educational attainment. From the perspec- tive of gender differences, long working hours have a more significant influence on the SRH of male workers, with this result being significant at the 1% level. Discussion This paper focused on investigating the impact of long working hours on the health of the workforce using the CMP regression analyses. Based on the literature on the effects of workforce health levels, the variables were strictly controlled to address the estimation bias result- ing from omitted variables and to ensure that the results were credible. The health of the workforce depends on the combination of long working hours, education, income levels and other individual characteristics Across the entire sample, long working hours were nega- tively correlated with health, that finding is consistent with previous reports 3, 36. An increase in working hours will diminish returns and lead to a decline in the SRH of the workforce. By participating in work activities, workers can give full play to their physical and social functions, but they can no longer obtain a sense of pleasure and belonging. Even if wage returns increase, the mental and physical strength of the workforce will be impaired. A gradual decline in the SRH level of the labor force will occur, increasing the risk factors for de- pression, hypertension, and other diseases 26, 42, 43. Participation in medical insurance has no significant effect on self-rated health Across the entire sample, long working hours were nega- tively correlated with health, and participation in med- insurance failed to significantly improve the SRH ical Table 3 Relationship between long working hours and the self-rated health of workforce among different age stages and education levels Long working hours Gender Age Income Level of education Marital status Smoking Drinking Exercise Frequency Medical Insurance Year Province Below junior college 0.0167 0.709 0.158 0.000 −0.0236 0.000 0.00865 0.019 0.0544 0.252 −0.107 0.140 0.0893 0.136 0.0164 0.002 −0.0925 0.228 YES YES Tertiary and above − 0.294 0.000 0.132 0.013 − 0.0329 0.000 −0.00458 0.578 0.0789 0.175 −0.245 0.054 0.235 0.047 0.0564 0.000 0.0942 0.306 YES YES Male −0.156 0.022 — — Female − 0.0394 0.325 — — − 0.0223 − 0.0273 0.000 0.0126 0.047 −0.0347 0.265 0.0108 0.864 − 0.0980 0.133 0.167 0.011 0.0312 0.001 0.101 0.316 YES YES 0.000 0.00459 0.272 −0.00783 0.698 0.0522 0.221 − 0.361 0.041 0.0202 0.841 0.0222 0.000 −0.0705 0.265 YES YES Observations Observations Log likelihood − 6889.171 Notes: p value in parentheses; p 0.1, p 0.05 and p 0.01. − 2976.8187 − 3117.2115 − 6990.6308 Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 level of the labor force In fact, it showed a downward trend. With a security model oriented towards “treat- ment, prevention, hospitalization and outpatient care”, China’s medical insurance system ignores disease pre- vention and outpatient treatment, and it fails to inter- vene in the workforce in a timely manner to eliminate the causes of workers’ physical discomfort. In China, the basic medical insurance for urban workers mainly covers inpatient medical expenses beyond the minimum pay- ment line, and medical expenses exceeding the max- imum payment line need to be paid by individuals. In some regions, medical expenses for general outpatient care are paid by individual or individual account of med- ical insurance. In order not to delay working hours or save expenses, the workforce physical appear “Minor ill- ness pain” more choice to wait for disease self-cure or buy medicine self-treatment, coupled with the labor force to disease prevention awareness is not strong, health level can not be improved. The medical insurance system “focus on treatment, neglect prevention ”of the ignored in the physical examination, security model maintenance and promotion of health protection. The relationship between long working hours and self- rated health varies by education and gender The study also demonstrates that long working hours have a more significant impact on the SRH of workers with higher levels of educational attainment. To some extent, the increase in the working hours of workers with higher educational levels is detrimental to their level of health, this is also supported by many other studies conducted in Korea , possibly because of the psychological pressure exerted by the self-expectations that they hold with regard to their occupations as well as the difference between giving and receiving. A differ- ence can be found in the time allocation between rest and workdays. The key to the decline in SRH lies in the factors that influence the physical and psychological as- pects of an individual, such as a lack of exercise, an un- reasonable diet, and working conditions that involve chronic exposure to computer radiation. Workers with lower educational levels are mostly engaged in alterna- tive work or repetitive manual labor, while those with levels are concentrated in low-end labor- lower skill intensive industries and services. Increased working hours have a limited impact on the health of these workers. Long working hours had a significant impact on the health of the male labor force. In the distribution of fam- ily roles, males have traditionally been breadwinners, fo- cusing more on their careers and being more susceptible to workplace stressors 45, 46. Men have to endure more stress and work longer hours than women, while women are more likely to play multiple roles at work and at home. Longer working hours have a limited im- pact on the health of women. Conclusions Using the nonfarm employed workforce and the 2016 and 2018 waves of the CFPS, this paper examined the relationship between long working hours and workforce health through the lens of working hours. It found that long working hours were negatively correlated with health and had a more significant impact on the SRH of workers with higher levels of educational attainment. The effects of long working hours on the SRH of the workforce vary by education and gender. This finding has great implications for future research, which should pay attention to regulating working time, carrying out a comprehensive health and hygiene education. This study offers several implications for working time to protect workers’ regulations and overtime rules health. In the short term, it may seem that long working hours for employees may be beneficial for maximizing the profits of companies, and increased working hours may result in higher performance. However, health is an important human capital factor for workers, and long working hours cannot contribute to sustained productiv- ity gains over a longer period. They lead to an excessive drain on the personal energy of workers, crowding out time that could be spent to invest in health and resulting in more work stress. This phenomenon can cause more work and mental stress and physical health problems, and it can even lead to the forced cessation of work. The analysis in this paper shows that the average working hours of the workforce exceed the requirements of the Labor Law of China, which thus makes it necessary to limit the excessive working hours of the workforce and promote the regularization of working hours in the labor market. Moreover, the regulations related to overtime hours should be further standardized, and employers should pay wages for the overtime hours of the work- force based on relevant legal standards to reduce the damage of excessive working hours to the health level of the workforce and to facilitate the balance between workers’ work and nonwork days. Although it is consistent with the characteristics of most Western countries in the period of rapid economic development, excessive labor harms the interests of workers and sustainable economic development. While maintaining sustained and healthy economic develop- ment, on the one hand, the government should raise the knowledge levels and skills of workers through formal targeting workers education and vocational with lower skill levels to increase their productivity. On the other hand, higher education should be the key to solving the health problems associated with educa- tion. Carrying out health education in universities and training, Chu BMC Public Health 2021 21:1347 changing life habits that are harmful to health provide directions for deepening the comprehensive hygiene edu- cation in China. The empirical analysis shows that whether the labor force participates in health insurance has no significant impact on workers’ SRH. From the promulgation of the Opinions on the Overall Planning of the Basic Medical Insurance System for Urban and Rural Residents to the completion of the integration of the system in the vast majority of regions in China, medical insurance has been able to meet more medical needs and has expanded its coverage, basically achieving the goal of universal health insurance. However, some problems remain to be solved in the implementation of China’s basic medical insur- ance system, which was originally established with the intention that all individuals facing the risk of diseases should share the risk to resist the financial and health impacts brought by diseases. Compared with commercial medical insurance, basic medical insurance can solve the problem of adverse selection. However, China has set up a basic medical insurance system for different groups of people instead of implementing a single basic medical insurance system. In terms of the payment for and treat- ment provided by basic medical insurance, there exists a large gap between urban workers and urban and rural residents. If they are able to make a choice, some healthy young people will choose to participate in the basic medical insurance of urban and rural residents, which involves low payment levels. To reduce the resistance of system integration, many regions have adopted the pol- icy of “Single System, Multi-Standard”. Based on the pre- mium level chosen, insured individuals can enjoy the corresponding treatment provided by medical insurance 47, 48. In practice, the “Single System, Multi-Standard” can easily cause an adverse selection of insured individ- uals, who will choose a high premium level if in poor health, which is not conducive to the long-term stable operation of health insurance funds. As a measure for promoting the integration of the basic medical insurance system, it is important to abolish the practice of “Single System, Multi-Standard”, increase the financial subsidies of low-income groups, ensure the full coverage of basic medical insurance, and truly unify the reimbursement provided by medical insurance.
