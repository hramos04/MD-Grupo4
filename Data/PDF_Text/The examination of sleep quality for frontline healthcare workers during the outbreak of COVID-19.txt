This study aimed to examine the sleep quality of frontline healthcare workers FLHCW in Bahrain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and compare it with the sleep quality of non-frontline healthcare workers NFLHCW. Methods Healthcare workers n = 280 from multiple facilities belonging to the Ministry of Health, Bahrain, were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including socio-demographics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI, and the Perceived Stress Scale PSS, was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and stress levels of healthcare workers. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI ≥ 5 and moderate-severe stress as PSS ≥ 14. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the scores of FLHCW and NFLHCW. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of poor sleep quality, moderate-severe stress, and the combined problem of poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. Results A total of 257 participants 129 FLHCW and 128 NFLHCW provided usable responses. The overall PSQI and PSS scores were 7.0 ± 3.3 and 20.2 ± 7.1, respectively. The FLHCW scored higher in the PSQI and PSS compared with the NFLHCW; however, the differences in the PSQI and PSS scores were not statistically significant. For the FLHCW, 75% were poor sleepers, 85% had moderate-severe stress, and 61% had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. For the NFLHCW, 76% were poor sleepers, 84% had moderate-severe stress, and 62% had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. Female sex and professional background were the predictors of poor sleep quality and stress. Conclusions Poor sleep quality and stress are common during the COVID-19 crisis. Approximately, 60% of both FLHCW and NFLHCW have poor sleep quality combined with moderate-severe stress. Keywords Bahrain . Coronavirus disease . Pandemic . Perceived stress scale .

Most human corona- virus infections are mild; however, some cases develop multi-organ infections, with the respiratory system being the most susceptible . In December 2019, a collection of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; a novel co- ronavirus was recognized with human-to-human transmis- sion mode 3, 4. The virus name is SARS-COV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 as named by the World Health Organization WHO . To date June 2, 2020, about 6,400,000 confirmed cases and more than 378,000 deaths attributable to this disease have been reported worldwide . Sleep Breath 2021 25:503–511 Outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the current COVID-19, are associated with major psychological distress and significant symptoms of mental illness 7–9. Healthcare workers may experience symptoms of sleep problems, anxi- ety, depression, and stress when facing a major incidence of public health threat 10–12. Subjective sleep quality is defined by the satisfaction of one’s overall sleep experience, including aspects of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, sleep quantity, and refreshment upon awakening . Objective sleep qual- ity consists of the total duration of sleep, the architec- ture of sleep, the amount of wake during sleep episode, and the frequency of awakenings across the night . Often, sleep quality measurement refers both to the sub- jective perception of sleep measured using a question- naire, or a clinical scale, and to objective measures derived from lab recordings, most often from polysomnographic PSG recordings . In the general population, poor sleep quality has been esti- mated to be between 9 and 45% . In general, research on healthcare workers revealed that approximately 50% of phy- sicians have poor sleep quality 16–18. Professionals in the healthcare industry are constantly under stress; deal with sick- ness, suffering, and death; and have an irregular work schedule and frequent shifts, which may all adversely impact their sleep 19–24. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Bahrain remains to be a serious challenge for healthcare workers. They are under constant risk of contracting the virus and be infected with the disease from their patients. They are also under great stress of keeping themselves and their family healthy; these may all lead to acute sleep problems, including poor sleep quality and short sleep duration . Very few studies have concentrated on the sleep quality of healthcare workers during pandemic events, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19. Therefore, the current study was de- signed to examine the sleep quality of healthcare workers in the confrontation with COVID-19, and to make a comparison between healthcare workers in the frontline and those not in the frontline. Frontline healthcare workers are defined in our research by those professionals in organizations dedicated to the assessment, quarantine, isolation, and treatment of established COVID-19 cases. We hypothesized that healthcare workers in frontline would have a poorer sleep quality profile compared with colleagues not directly engaged in the front line. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was planned and completed using the principles of the guidelines of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology . Ethical consideration The Research Ethics Committee REC of the Secondary Healthcare Research Committee/Ministry of Health, Bahrain, approved the research SHCRC/06/04/2020, and data collection was started after receiving the approval. Electronic informed consent was sought and obtained from each participant. Participation was voluntary, with no mone- tary or non-monetary incentives given, and the participant was permitted to withdraw at any time. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki for human research. Setting and participants The study was conducted using an online survey in April 2020. Frontline healthcare workers n = 138 were recruited using purposive sampling from two COVID-19 locations be- longing to the Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Bahrain. Frontline healthcare workers FLHCW were defined as those working in the isolation/quarantine units, fever clinics, nasal swab clinics, and those looking after patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Non-frontline healthcare workers NFLHCW n = 145 were selected through a convenience non-probability sample using the acquaintances of the research team. Participants from both groups were invited to take part in the survey via an online web link sent using social network platforms such as WhatsApp messenger offered by WhatsApp Inc. When the participants clicked on the link, they were taken to an elec- tronic Google Form, starting with a description for the study objectives, consent of participation, and other ethical points. Google Form saves each filled questionnaire in the principal investigator’s Google drive. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1 participants with more than 6 months of service in Ministry of Health, Bahrain; 2 professional healthcare workers in- cluding medical doctors, registered nurses, and state registered allied staff; 3 agreed to participate in the survey. The exclu- sion criteria were as follows: 1 healthcare workers who were not actively on duty at the time of the survey due to any leave of absence; 2 significantly incomplete data of the online questionnaires. Tools and techniques An English language, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, as the professional communication language of Medicine in Bahrain is English. The questionnaire consisted of structured, closed-ended questions. There were no open-ended or continuing questions, making the question- naire simple and quick to answer. Based on a pilot test, the research team estimated that it would take each participant around 7 to 10 min to complete the questionnaire. The Sleep Breath 2021 25:503–511 questionnaire was divided into three domains: socio-demo- graphics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI , and the Perceived Stress Scale PSS . Variables As described above, the survey collected data on several socio-demographic variables. These included basic data to preserve the anonymity of the participants, including age, sex, marital status, professional background, and type of fa- cility affiliated with to distinguish between FLHCW and NFLHCW. The PSQI is a well-known self-reported tool that assesses sleep quality over 1 month. The measure consists of 19 indi- vidual items, generating seven components that produce one global score, and takes 5–10 min to complete . The seven components include 1 subjective sleep quality, 2 sleep la- tency, 3 sleep duration, 4 habitual sleep efficiency, 5 sleep disturbances, 6 use of sleep-promoting medications, and 7 daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness . The PSQI has been used in many settings and with multiple pop- ulations . A recent meta-analysis confirmed that the PSQI has superior content validity, construct validity, and discrim- inant validity . It has a sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with a sleep disorder, using a cutoff score of 5 points . A global PSQI score ≥ 5 is sug- gestive of poor sleep quality . The PSS, also known as Cohen’s PSS, is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress . The tool measures the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful originally using a 14-item scale , which was later reduced to 10-item scale . Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores rang- ing from 0 to 13 would be considered low stress, scores rang- ing from 14 to 26 would be considered moderate stress, while scores ranging from 27 to 40 would be considered high per- ceived stress . A review of the psychometric evidence of the PSS concluded that PSS is an easy-to-use tool with established acceptable psychometric properties . The PSS was deemed appropriate in this research to be used as a complementary measure to examine the perceived stress of healthcare workers. This allows making a correlation between sleep quality and levels of stress especially during emergency and unusual times. Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using the STATA 16.1 version 16, 2019, College Station, TX; StataCorp LLC . Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participants’ socio- demographic factors. The arithmetic mean x̄ and standard deviation SD were reported for continuous variables, and counts and percentages were reported for categorical vari- ables. To compare the two groups, the independent sample t test was used for continuous variables, and Chi-square χ2 was used for categorical variables. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient r was used to measure the strength and direction of association that exist PSQI and PSS on a contin- uous scale. To assess the predictors of poor sleep quality, moderate- severe stress, or the combination of both poor sleep quality and stress, a univariate logistic regression model was applied in a preliminary analysis where one explanatory variable was tested in the model at a time. Tested variables included demo- graphics, age, sex, marital status, professional background, and being a frontline or non-frontline. All variables then en- tered in a multivariate logistic regression to define the inde- pendent predictors of high risk for poor sleep quality, stress, or both. Odds ratios were computed with 95% confidence inter- vals 95% CI. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI ≥ 5 and moderate-severe stress as PSS ≥ 14. Results Participants’ socio-demographic characteristics A total of 264 of the 280 approached healthcare workers responded to the study, with a response rate of 94%. Seven forms contained significant missing data and therefore were excluded from the analyses leaving us with 257 cases 129 in FLHCW and 128 in NFLHCW. The two groups were very homogenous in their socio-demographic characteristics. The overall mean age was 40.2 ± 9.7 years, about 70% were fe- males, and approximately 90% were married. Staff nurses represented 50% of the sample, medical doctors came second with about 30%, and finally, allied healthcare professionals were about 20%. Table 1 provides the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants and a comparison be- tween FLHCW and NFLHCW. Participants’ sleep quality and perceived stress were mea- sured using the PSQI and the PSS, respectively. Data on the PSQI and PSS scores are presented visually in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The mean PSQI for the entire sample was 7.0 ± 3.3, and FLHCW was slightly higher compared with none- FLHCW counterparts; however, no statistically significant difference was detected. The prevalence of poor sleep quality according to the utilized sleep index was 75%, using the stan- dard cutoff of 5 points. The prevalence of poor sleep quality drops to 64.6% and 51.2% using cutoffs of 6 points and 7 points, respectively. No statistical difference was obtained when comparing males with females P = 0.9. Single partic- ipants scored a mean PSQI score of 7.9 ± 0.6 compared with married participants who scored 6.9 ± 0.2; this difference did not reach statistical significance.

The difference in PSQI scores between the different professional backgrounds was not statistically signif- icant P = 0.11. Close inspection of the seven components of the PSQI revealed that the FLHCW group had lower subjec- tive sleep quality, longer sleep latency, longer sleep duration, similar sleep efficacy, more sleep disturbances, slightly more use of sleep-promoting medications, and slightly more day- time dysfunction compared with the NFLHCW group. The mean PSS score for the entire sample was 20.2 ± 7.1, and the score of the FLHCW group was slightly higher com- pared with the NFLHCW counterparts; however, no statisti- cally significant difference was detected. Generally, females scored a mean score of 20.7 ± 0.5, which is higher than males 19.2 ± 0.9; however, the difference was not statistically signif- icant. Single participants scored a mean score of 20.6 ± 1.2 compared with married participants 20.2 ± 0.5. Medical doctors and staff nurses and other healthcare professionals also appeared to have a similar PSS profile with values of 20.3 ± 7.6, 20.1 ± 7.1, and 20.4 ± 6.3, respectively. The differ- ence in PSS scores between the different professional back- grounds was not statistically significant P = 0.96. tests indicated that Table 3 presents the strength of the association be- tween sleep quality and perceived stress. The results of several the PSQI scores were not associated with the PSS scores. Pearson product- moment correlation coefficient indicated a weak positive association between the two variables, but this was not statistically significant at P 0.05. In a subsequent analysis, we categorized the participants into two categories based on the PSQI score and the PSS score severity. The results showered that 191 participants 75.2% of the total sample were of poor sleep quality a global PSQI score ≥ 5. On the other hand, 216 84% were experiencing moderate-severe stress a PSS score of 27–40.

Table 4 provides the results of the univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models for predicting poor sleep qual- ity, moderate-severe perceive stress, and the combination of both among healthcare workers. No predictors could be identi- fied for poor sleep quality. For moderate-severe stress, sex was the only independent predictor. Female sex had an OR 2.0 95% CI 1.1–4.0, P = 0.04. The independent predictors for combined poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress were female sex OR 2.0 95% CI 1.1–3.5, P = 0.01 and being a health-allied non-physician OR 0.7 95% CI 0.5–1.1, P = 0.05. Discussion This is the first study to examine the sleep quality and per- ceived stress among frontline medical staff in the Arab world and among the first in the world using the PSQI and the PSS during the COVID-19 pandemic. A major finding of this study is that FLHCW do not statistically differ from NFLHCW in sleep quality or stress. The mean global PSQI of the study group was 7.1 indicating poor sleep quality, and the mean PSS score was 20.3, which reflects moderate stress. The findings translate to that 75% of healthcare workers had poor sleep quality, and 84% had moderate-severe stress. A total of 61% of the studied participants had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. There was no significant linear association between PSQI and PSS scores. Female sex OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1–3.5, P = 0.01 and professional background OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5–1.1, P = 0.05 were pre- dictors for poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress using a multivariate model. This prevalence rate of poor sleep quality was higher than most of the studies that assessed sleep quality among healthcare workers. For example, in a sample of US doctors working in the emergency room, Machi et al. reported that the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 31% . Another study in Pakistan reported that poor sleep quality was 37% among physicians . A recent study in the region, in Saudi Arabia, reported that 51% of primary care physicians had poor sleep quality . The higher prevalence of poor sleep quality in this study may be related to concerns related to the contagious nature of COVID-19. This is supported by a recent study, in China, of tion that reported a higher mean PSQI score of 8.6 ± 4.6 com- parable with our results . Another recent study from China on insomnia among frontline health professionals using the Insomnia Severity Index reported that 36% of those healthcare professionals had reported sleep disturbances .

In general, healthcare workers are at an increased risk of work-related stress . In the current study, the mean PSS score was high, with a value of 20.3. With the added concerns about COVID-19, poor sleep and stress among healthcare workers are expected to increase. This is supported by the finding that severe stress in the present study was more prev- alent among FLHCW compared with the NFLHCW. The re- ported numbers of healthcare victims of SARS-CoV-2 fuel this fear and stress among FLHCW . Another interesting finding in this study is the fact that female sex was a predictor of poor sleep quality and stress. The majority of participates in this study were female nurses. Nurses, in general, as an occu- pational group, are subjected to multiple stressors . Additionally, women are more likely to complain of sleep problems 36, 37, stress, and neuropsychiatric complaints and somatoform disorders, such as headache, depression, and anxiety 44, 45. The present study demonstrated that sex and being a non- physician health-allied member were the predictors of the combined poor sleep quality and severe perceived stress. As discussed above, women had been reported to have a higher prevalence of poor sleep quality and stress . Additionally, women tend to have greater bodily attentiveness and aware- ness of physical symptoms than men . It has been pro- posed that society, in general, is more receptive to women to express their psychological distress and somatic symptoms . This is another plausible mechanism to explain the in- creased reporting of poor sleep quality and stress in survey studies. Poor sleep quality, stress, and mental health problems among healthcare workers could impair their cognitive abili- ties and their clinical decision-making 48, 49. Thus, increas- ing the likelihood of making medical errors that may increase the risk to patients. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that acute stress in disasters could result in a lasting effect on the overall well-being . Therefore, looking after the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic should be a crucial public health concern. The development and implementation of mental health assessment, support, and intervention become essential to manage the mental health consequences during the outbreak and after. Even though frontline healthcare workers are categorized as a level one category that is vulnerable to mental health problems, similar to the patient infected with the COVID-19 virus, still, there is a limited number of studies investigating the mental health im- pacts on these workers . Stress is closely associated with sleep quality and this has been documented by previous re- search that utilized the PSS and PSQI as research tools 52–54. Nonetheless, some studies suggested that people who are trained to deal with stress such as healthcare workers, Sleep Breath 2021 25:503–511 law enforcement officers, etc. can maintain relatively stable emotional state even under stress, and they may experience fewer episodes of night waking, sleep anxiety, and sleep delay . A recent study from Wuhan, China, that investigated anxiety, stress, self-efficacy, and sleep quality among frontline medical staff treating COVID-19 patients concluded that anx- iety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables to so- cial support and sleep quality. Several factors may contribute to healthcare workers’ sleep quality and stress in the working environment, including physical strain caused by the perceived physical isolation re- strictions on interaction with others, even after working hours, the use of protective equipment throughout working hours with the resulting dehydration and exhaustion, the ne- cessity for constant vigilance regarding infection control pro- cedures, long working shifts, and conceivable separation from and concern about family members with fears of infecting family members and beloved ones . A re- cent review concluded that the severity of stress and lack of sleep was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, prolonged night shifts, type of activities performed, and proximity to COVID-19 patients . These factors need to be addressed in future research as potential confounding factors. Recommended measures for supporting healthcare pro- viders include the provision of individually psychological support interventions. This includes the provision of training in some aspects that they perceived to be highly important to promote their competence, such as handling emotionally dis- tressed patients, guaranteeing staff daily supplies from protec- tive equipment, meals, and other daily living supplies and provision of accommodation and places for rest and leisure activities. To improve sleep, more focus could be directed toward a healthy diet provided to healthcare workers to be rich with vitamins, minerals, healthy fats omega-3 fatty acids, prebiotics, and probiotics, with a reduced amount of sugars and energy-dense fast foods 57, 58. It has been found that the provision of social support during the COVID-19 outbreak has positive impacts on lowering stress responses, anxiety symptoms, along with improving healthcare workers’ self-efficacy to enable them to maintain stable emotions and promote self-control during pressure. This indirectly is associated with promoting sleep quality . Strengths and limitations There are several strengths to make this study valuable. First, to our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the sleep quality of healthcare workers in Bahrain and the Arab World during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 and one of the first in the world. Second, the inclusion of multidisciplinary professionals allowed for compari- son between different backgrounds. However, our study has a few limitations that need to be addressed. First, the reliance on a cross-sectional study does not allow us to analyze sleep and stress over some time. Thus, data from different stages of the pandemic stages are lacking. For example, the alert phase will require significant prepared- ness efforts, and therefore, stress and sleep disturbances might be different than transition or end stages. Second, we focused on healthcare workers who are involved directly in the provi- sion of care to patients; however, other jobs may expose per- formers indirectly to COVID-19 patients, such as administra- tors, communication officers, and logistics. Therefore, these groups must also be studied in future studies. Third, to keep the survey time acceptable, our questionnaires did not address potential confounders, e.g., caffeine or nicotine intakes, diets, medical history, shift work details, and coexisting sleep dis- orders such as obstructive sleep apnea. Finally, we do not have a control group of participants working outside the healthcare profession. Conclusion The present study showed that about 75% of healthcare workers had poor sleep quality, 85% had moderate- severe stress, and 60% had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. The differences in PSQI and PSS were not significant between FLHCW and NFLHCW. No association was obtained between per- ceived stress and sleep quality. Sex and professional background were the most impacting predictors of poor sleep quality and mental health. During pandemics, pre- ventive interventions aiming to maintain the health con- dition of healthcare workers are warranted.
