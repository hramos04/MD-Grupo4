Hajat et al. Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 Open Access The health impact of smokeless tobacco products: a systematic review , E. Stein2, L. Ramstrom3, S. Shantikumar4 and R. Polosa5,6 C. Hajat1 Abstract Introduction: The objective was to systematically review studies on health outcomes from smokeless tobacco SLT products. Methods: We analysed published literature on the health outcomes from SLT use between 01/01/2015 to 01/02/2020, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA protocol using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Results: Of 53 studies included, six were global, 32 from Asia, Middle East and Africa AMEA, nine from USA and six from Europe. ‘Poor’-rated studies predominated 23;43%, in particular, for global 4;66% and AMEA 16;50%. Health outcomes differed between SLT-products and regions; those in AMEA were associated with higher mortality overall, cancer, Coronary heart disease CHD, respiratory but not cardiovascular disease CVD, and morbidity CVD, oral and head and neck cancers, with odds ratios up to 38.7. European studies showed no excess mortality overall, CVD, from cancers or morbidity ischemic heart disease IHD, stroke, oral, head and neck, pancreatic or colon cancers from several meta-analyses; single studies reported elevated risk of rectal cancer and respiratory disorders. Pooled study data showed protection against developing Parkinson’s disease. US studies showed mixed results for mortality raised overall, CHD, cancer and smoking-related cancer mortality; no excess risk of respiratory or CVD mortality. Morbidity outcomes were also mixed, with some evidence of increased IHD, stroke and cancer risk oral, head and neck. No studies reported on switching from cigarettes to SLT-products. Conclusion: Our review demonstrates stark differences between different SLT-products in different regions, ranging from zero harm from European snus to greatly increased health risks in AMEA. The literature on the safety profile for SLT-products for harm reduction is incomplete and potentially misinforming policy and regulation. Keywords: Tobacco harm reduction, Smokeless tobacco, Snus, Snuff, Moist snuff, Smoking, Tobacco, Cardiovascular disease, Cancer, Mortality, Respiratory disease, Mental health Introduction The use of SLT-products exceeds that of all other forms of tobacco use in some parts of the world. The prevalence of SLT-product use in men is 30% in India, 6% in Ice- land , and 20% in Sweden . SLT is rising in parts of Europe and some have attributed its use to the concomi- tant reduction in smoking prevalence 3–5. Correspondence: Full list of author information is available at the end of the article There are numerous types of SLT-products available globally which differ markedly in terms of their prepa- ration, method of use and toxicity. Key features of some of the most common SLT-products are detailed in “Appendix 1”. Although there has been no clear consensus on safety profiles of SLT-products, it is generally accepted that they pose a lower health risk than cigarettes. Despite the many differences described above, SLT-products are often regarded together as a single product and safety concerns have resulted in varying regulations and bans on sales and use globally.

Hajat et al. Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 review was to identify, narratively synthesize, assess the strength and quality of evidence, and critically appraise studies that report health outcomes associated with use of different SLT-products in different regions of the world. Methods We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the health impact of SLT-products between January 1, 2015, and February 1, 2020. SLT-products included all types including snus, chewing tobacco, snuff and other products included in Table 1 “Appendix 1”. For the purpose of this review, we reported findings according to three geographical regions, which best align with dif- ferent types of SLT-products consumed, namely Europe EU, the Americas USA, and SE Asia, Eastern Mediter- ranean and Africa AMEA regions. The study followed PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews . We included health outcomes of new onset or control of disease end-points. We did not include other health out- comes such as short-term physiological changes which do not necessarily manifest as disease or quality of life or in vitro effects. Search strategy and eligibility criteria A literature search was conducted between October 1, 2019, and February 26, 2020, using the databases Pub- Med, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar using medical subject headings.

Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 There were two domains: one for SLT-products and one for health outcomes, specifically CVD, cancer, res- piratory, mortality and ‘other’ health outcomes. Search terms included “Smokeless tobacco” OR “smokeless tobacco product” OR “chewing tobacco”OR “reduced risk tobacco”OR “non-cigarette tobacco” OR “snus” OR “snuff ” AND “health outcome” OR “morbidity” OR “mortality” OR “cancer”OR “cardiovascular disease”OR “chronic obstruct pulmonary disease” OR “COPD” OR “CVD” OR “acute myocardial infarction”OR “stroke” OR “cardiovascular” OR “cerebrovascular”OR “health effects”OR “adverse” OR “effects” OR “respiratory”. Search results were filtered to include English language, human studies and studies published from 01/01/2015 until 01/02/2020, in order to capture current product types and their changing pattern of use. The health out- comes of interest such as mortality, cancer and CVD, can take many years to develop and manifest and would still have been captured from use of historical SLT products. The references of relevant reviews were manually searched for additional eligible citations. Titles, abstracts and full texts of the search results were sequentially screened by two reviewers independently for inclusion, using the eligibility criteria below, with disa- greements resolved via blind review by a third reviewer. Figure 1 shows the inclusion and exclusion criteria used. Reasons for excluding studies are shown in Fig. 2. Data extraction and quality assessment For included studies, data were extracted including author, year, country, aim, study design, sample size, par- ticipants and relevant findings such as effect sizes and nature of impact on health outcomes. Studies were cat- egorized by region including global, AMEA, USA and EU. A level of evidence category was assigned using the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine framework and a similar approach used to categorise methodo- logical quality as “good”, “fair” or “poor” utilizing the National Institutes for Health NIH Quality Assessment Inclusion criteria were: Exclusion criteria were: • Meta-analyses/pooled data, randomized controlled trials, cohort, cross-sectional, ecological, case- control and case studies reporting primary or secondary quantitative data • Human in vivo studies • • English language articles Representative samples or clinical subgroups e.g., patients with asthma, patients with high blood pressure Studies examining impact on health outcomes defined as a disease end- point or impact on a disease end-point e.g., disease control, including mortality, cardiovascular or respiratory disease, cancer or ‘other’ health outcomes • Fig. 1 . • • Studies not presenting novel data e.g., commentaries, letters, reviews, consensus statements and institutional reports as these may have led to biased selection from a handful of countries Animal, in vitro and in silico studies, or studies examining constituents of SLT e.g., carcinogens or toxins because these do not necessarily translate to disease end-points in humans • Non-English language articles due to • • reasons of feasibility Studies published before 1st January Studies examining biomarkers, intermediate markers, risk factors for disease or short term physiological changes e.g., heart rate, blood pressure BP, levels of carcinogens rather than disease end-points, in non-disease situations, e.g. BP in non-diseased participants as they are not indicative of long-term disease outcomes. Only studies that reported on disease end- points or control of a condition, such as hypertension, myocardial infarction etc., were included. Hajat et al.

Tools . The NIH quality assessment tools include fea- tures to assess risk of bias, such as selection and report- ing bias, with a “good” rating reflecting a low risk of bias, and a “poor” rating suggesting a high risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis was performed by two reviewers independently with blind assessment by a third reviewer for cases with rater disagreement. Findings of all stud- ies were independently reviewed, coded and compared between studies to identify relationships and themes. We considered a meta-analysis of studies included in our review to be inappropriate, partly due to the com- mon methodological flaws and the vast heterogene- ity between studies. As such no statistical testing was required, only narrative reporting of study findings. Results Of the 53 studies included, six included global data, 32 were exclusively from AMEA, nine exclusively from USA, and six exclusively from Europe. The number of studies by study design and health outcomes are shown in Table 2. All six global studies were meta-analyses or of pooled data. Studies from AMEA were predominantly case– control designs 16; 50% and hospital-based, followed by cross-sectional 8; 25%. In Europe, the commonest study design was meta-analyses 4; 57% and cohort 4; 28%. In the USA, cross-sectional 3; 38% and cohort 2; 28% were the most common study designs. Cancer was the most common outcome, comprising more than Hajat et al.

Mortality was also reported commonly across all regions. Table 3 summarizes the quality ratings assigned to studies by health outcome, with inter-rater agreement on 49 out of 53 92% for quality and level of evidence categoriese. A ‘poor’ rating was commonest 23;43%, followed by fair 21;39%; then good 9;17%. Global 4;66% and AMEA studies 16;50% had greater ‘poor’- rated studies. ‘Good’ ratings were given to 33% 2 of global studies, 28% 2 of Europe studies, 6% 2 of AMEA studies and 38% 3 of US studies. Two studies reported on benefits from SLT-product use; a cross-sectional study on hypertension and a meta-analysis on Parkinson’s disease in Europe.

Quality assigned as “good”, “fair” or “poor” utilizing NIH Quality Assessment Tools . Health outcomes by region Global Six studies reported on combined global SLT-product data 10–14, 53. Mortality A “good”-rated meta-analysis of 20 studies on snuff not Swedish snus, chewing tobacco and naswar from Europe, the USA, Southeast Asia and the Mediterra- nean region found a borderline association of combined SLT-products and fatal CHD OR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.00– 1.20, higher risk with naswar OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.06– 1.54 but not chewing tobacco, in smoking-adjusted studies . A “poor”-rated meta-analysis of 14 stud- ies in Europe, USA, Southeast Asia and Mediterranean found combined SLT-product users had higher risk of fatal stroke OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.15–1.39 after exclud- ing or adjusting for smoking . Another “good”-rated meta-analysis of 19 studies from North America, Asia, and Europe found increased risk of deaths from ischae- mic heart disease IHD OR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.01–1.30 and stroke OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.29–1.49 in SLT-prod- uct ever-users compared with never tobacco-users . A “poor”-rated meta-analysis that pooled together different SLT-products from 16 global studies reported increased risk of overall mortality OR = 1.22; 95%I: 1.11–134, with significant heterogeneity . A “poor”-rated meta-analysis of 32 global studies esti- mated 1.7 million disability-adjusted life years DALYs lost and 62,283 deaths in 2010 globally from cancers of the mouth, pharynx and oesophagus attributed to SLT- product . Most included studies adjusted for but didn’t exclude smoking. Cardiovascular outcomes One ’good’-rated meta-analyses of 19 studies on chewing tobacco, dip, snuff and snus from Sweden, North Amer- ica, and Asia found no increase in IHD for combined regions OR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.92–1.42 in studies that excluded former smokers . Another ‘good’-rated meta-analysis of 20 studies from four WHO regions including snuff, chewing tobacco and naswar found no increased risk of CHD overall OR = 1.05; 95%CI 0.95–1.16 or for chewing tobacco OR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.92–1.06, but did for naswar OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.06–1.54, including studies that excluded or adjusted for smoking . A ‘poor’-rated global meta-analysis on SLT-prod- ucts, which did not account for variation in handling of smoking status, reported an association with stroke overall OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.04–1.32 and chewing tobacco OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.20–1.50 but not for snuff OR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.93–1.13 or naswar OR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.57–1.39 . Cancer Oral Cancer A ‘poor’-rated global meta-analysis of 32 studies found an association with oral cancer overall OR = 3.43; 95% CI 2.26–5.19 . Head and Neck Cancer HNC A ‘poor’-rated meta-analysis reported an association with pharyngeal cancer for all countries combined OR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.55–3.20 and India OR = 2.60; 95% CI 1.76– 3.85; and oesophageal cancer for all countries combined OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.70–2.78, India OR = 2.57; 95% CI 2.20–3.00 and Pakistan OR = 8.20; 95% CI 1.45–27.47 . Other cancers A meta-analysis of 16 global studies found combined SLT products were associated with mortality due to cancers overall HR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.16–1.47, of upper aero digestive tract UADT HR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.47– 3.22, stomach HR = 1.33; 95% CI 1.12–1.59 and cervix HR = 2.07; 95% CI 1.64–2.61 .

Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 SE Asia, Middle East, Africa AMEA Oral cancer 10–40, 53, 80–84, 32 exclusively from AMEA region 15–40, 80–84. Mortality ‘poor’-rated meta-analysis of 16 global studies A reported increased overall mortality for South East Asian SEAR OR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.08–1.44, with significant heterogeneity . A longitudinal study of 50,045 participants from Iran found naswar use in never-smokers was associated with increased overall mortality HR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.00–1.36 and cancer mortality HR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.01–1.95, which was further elevated in dual cigarette and naswar users overall mortality: HR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.00–1.64; can- cer mortality: HR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.75; there was no elevated risk of IHD, CVD or respiratory mortality . A ‘poor’-rated Indian case–control study found increased overall RR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.2–1.4 and respir- atory mortality RR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.4–1.7 for chewing tobacco users amongst never-smokers . Cardiovascular outcomes One good quality global meta-analyses on 19 studies of SLT-products chewing tobacco, dip, snuff and snus found increased IHD risk in Asia OR = 1.40; 95%CI 1.01–1.95 after excluding former smokers . A poor- rated meta-analysis reported an association between SLT-products and stroke in SE Asia OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.18–1.51, but not in Mediterranean . A poor- rated cohort study in India reported increased stroke OR = 3.71; 95% CI 1.57–9.05 and myocardial infarc- tion MI OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.10–5.40 in SLT users without excluding former smokers . study Indian cross-sectional reported no increased diabetes or hypertension in exclusive SLT- product users , although former smoking was not accounted for. An Indian cross-sectional study of reported no association with CHD compared with exclusive smokers ; another study with 30 exclusive SLT-product users reported strong associations with dyslipidaemia OR = 6.37; 95% CI 1.4–27.3 and hyper- tension OR = 6.97; 95% CI 1.7–28.0 compared with non-tobacco users . An Cancer Of 25 studies on cancer in AMEA region 14, 21–29, 31–40, 53, 80–82, only one was rated as ‘good’ . ‘good’-rated meta-analysis A in Pakistan reported an association between naswar use and oral cancer OR = 11.8; 95% CI 11.4–25.3, four of six studies had adjusted for smoking . A ‘poor’-rated meta-analysis of 32 global studies reported an association between combined SLT-products and oral cancer in India OR = 5.12; 95% CI 3.27–8.02 and Pakistan OR = 8.81; 95% CI 3.14–24.69 . A ‘poor’-rated Indian meta-analysis of 25 studies reported increased oral cancer risk with combined SLT- products OR = 5.65; 95% CI 3.83–8.40 . A ‘poor’- rated meta-analysis of Shammah use in Middle East and North Africa , in which only one of three studies adjusted for smoking, reported elevated risk of oral can- cer OR = 38.7; 95% CI 19.50–76.96. Of several small, predominantly hospital-based, case– control studies, two in Saudi Arabia found elevated oral cancer with exclusive Shammah use OR = 29.30; 95% CI 10.33–83.13 , OR = 33.01; 95% CI 3.22–39.88 and lower risk with dual use of shammah and ciga- rettes OR = 10.10; 95%CI = 0.50–20.40 . A study in Pakistan found elevated risk with gutka OR = 5.54; 95% CI 2.83–10.83 and chewing tobacco OR = 5.32; 95% CI 1.14–24.77 . An Indian study reported elevated risks with chewing tobacco OR = 8.51; 95% CI 4.90– 14.77 , and a Sudanese study from Tokomak dipping OR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.7–8.6, after adjusting for smoking . A study of naswar use in Pakistan reported elevated risk for current users OR = 23.4; 95% CI 6.6–82.1, ever users OR = 21.0; 95% CI 6.1–72.1 and former users OR = 16.4; 95% CI 4.1–65.4, after adjusting for smok- ing . An Indian study reported elevated risk of oral cancer for combined SLT-products OR = 6.0; 95% CI 2.6–15.5, gutkha OR = 5.1; 95% CI 2.0–10.3, supari OR = 11.4; 95% CI 3.4–38.2 and betel quid OR = 6.4; 95% CI 2.6–15.5, but not for snuff OR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.3–3.0, after adjusting for smoking . Another Indian study reported elevated risk in sole chewing tobacco users OR = 2.8; 95% CI 1.2–7.0 but not in dual users OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.2–2.6 . A case–control study in Pakistan reported elevated risk for combined SLT-prod- ucts OR = 4.71; 95% CI 2.53–8.74, snuff OR = 4.82; 95% CI 2.37–9.80, betel leaf OR = 4.42; 95% CI 1.66– 11.91 and supari/chalia OR = 4.67; 95% CI 1.14–19.12 after adjusting for smoking . We found in addition two case series 33, 34 and one ecological study . Head and neck cancer Of studies investigating SLT-product use and head and neck cancer HNC, a ‘poor’-rated meta-analysis reported an association with pharyngeal cancer in India Hajat et al. Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 OR = 2.60; 95%CI = 1.76–3.85 and oesophageal can- cer in India OR = 2.57; 95% CI 2.20–3.00 and Pakistan OR = 8.20; 95% CI 1.45–27.47 . A ‘poor’-rated meta- analysis from India reported an association between combined SLT-products and pharyngeal OR = 2.69; 95% CI 2.28–3.17 and oesophageal cancers OR = 3.17; 95% CI 2.76–3.63 . A case–control study from Nepal reported an associa- tion between chewing tobacco and HNC OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.77–3.23, higher with heavy use ≥ 6 times per day OR = 2.91; 95% CI 2.06–4.12 and duration over 20 years OR = 2.92; 95% CI 2.08–4.11 . One study described the commonest sites for chewing tobacco related HNC cancer as the gingivobuccal complex .

Mortality A large US study constituting a high level of evidence pooling two longitudinal studies found no increase in mortality overall or due to smoking-related cancers or CVD in never smoking SLT-product users compared with never-smoking never-SLT-product users . Dual users of SLT-product and cigarettes had similar excess mortality HR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.50–3.26-HR = 2.14; 95% CI 1.27–3.59 to exclusive smokers non-SLT-product users HR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.99–2.22-HR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.75–2.02, compared with never tobacco users. A large ‘good’-rated US longitudinal study found exclu- sive SLT-product users had increased all-cause mortal- ity HR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.12–1.84 but not cause-specific mortality . A large ‘fair’-rated US longitudinal study that excluded former and current smokers, but included both reported on snuff and chewing tobacco together, reported higher CHD mortality OR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.05–1.46 but not mortality overall or from cancer and other types of CVD . A large and ‘good’-rated US population-based cohort study reported higher over- all mortality HR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.17–1.59, CHD mor- tality HR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.27–2.09, cancer mortality HR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.04–2.12 and smoking-related can- cer HR = 1.76; 95% CI 1.07–2.90, but not respiratory- related or CVD mortality in SLT-using never-smokers . Higher risk of overall mortality was only seen with daily SLT use HR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.20–1.66 and not with less than once daily use.

Cancer Oral cancer A ‘poor’-rated review that pooled 11 US studies found SLT-products snuff and chewing tobacco to be associ- ated with cancers of oral cavity OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.04, 3.17 . A large ‘poor’-rated global meta-analysis found no association with oral cancer in North American data . Head and neck cancer The largest study investigating HNC, a ‘poor’-rated global MA , reported for pharyngeal and oesophageal can- cers, respectively: associations for all countries combined OR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.55–3.20; OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.70– 2.78 but not for North America single study only. A review that pooled 11 US studies found increased odds for HNC in snuff users OR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.08–2.70 but not for ever-tobacco chewers, compared with never users . with a dose–response effect with increasing dura- tion of snuff use p-value for trend = 0.007. Other cancers There were no exclusive US data on other cancers. Cardiovascular outcomes Four meta-analyses, three global, including 14 , 20 and 19 global studies, and one of 24 EU stud- ies , of which three were rated as ‘good’ 10, 12, 47, and all of mixed study-designs, found no association between snus use and IHD RR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.93– 1.16 , OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.83–1.01 , CHD OR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.81–1.06 , or stroke OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.94–1.15 , RR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.92–1.17 , OR = 1.01; 95% CI 0.90–1.13 in studies that excluded former smokers. Cancer Oral cancer There were no region-specific studies of oral cancer in Europe. A ‘poor’-rated global meta-analysis showed no association between combined SLT-products oral cancer in Sweden or Norway . A ‘poor’-rated meta-analysis on 37 global case–control and cohort studies found no association between snus and moist snuff use and oral cancer in European data .

Other health outcomes Other cancer One US cross-sectional study reported no significant association between SLT-product use and a diagnosis of mental health disease or depression . Europe Of 16 studies reporting on SLT-product data from EU 10–14, 47, 51–56, 85, seven were exclusively from EU 51–56, 85. Mortality A large ‘fair’-rated study pooling nine Swedish cohort studies found no association between exclusive current snus use and all-cause mortality HR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.89– 1.50, compared with never-smoking non-snus users . A ‘fair’-rated cohort study on Swedish prostate cancer patients reported increased overall mortality HR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.04–1.37 in snus users compared with non- snus users, in never smokers, and a similar risk for dual snus and cigarette OR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.06–1.28 .

Discussion This is one of the first articles to systematically review health outcomes from SLT product use, and in particular, to differentiate between the different types of products used in Asia, Middle East and Africa, Sweden, other parts of Europe and the US. Most studies were from AMEA and were less likely to be of rigorous study design than those from Europe and the USA. Two-thirds of global studies and a half of US studies evaluated mortality 66%; 50%, whereas AMEA studies mostly evaluated cancer 23; 72%. Meta-analyses made up 100% of global studies and 57% of Europe stud- ies. Case–control represented 50% of AMEA studies. Methodological flaws with the greatest impact included combining different SLT-products as seen in the global meta-analyses 10–14, 53, and widespread failure to ade- quately account for dual and former cigarette smoking. Health outcomes Results indicate stark differences for health outcomes for different SLT-products and regions. There is overwhelm- ing evidence that SLT-products in AMEA are associated with harmful health outcomes, including higher mortal- ity: strongly for overall, cancer, CHD; less so for respira- tory mortality and not shown to increase overall CVD mortality; increased CVD morbidity, with strong associa- tions for IHD and stroke, and mixed evidence for hyper- tension and dyslipidaemia. Different SLT-products, even within the same region, have varied strengths of association with oral cancer, with odds ratios ranging from 29 to 39 for shammah; tobacco and 3.8 for tokomak dipping compared to non- use. All types of SLT-products used in AMEA were asso- ciated with head and neck cancers albeit with lower odds than for oral cancer, of up to 3.2. In stark contrast, the fewer but higher-quality studies in Europe, predominantly in Sweden, found snus and other SLT-products not to cause higher mortality or morbidity overall or from overall mortality, CVD or cancers. Two high quality meta-analyses showed no excess mortality, although one smaller cohort study contradicted this find- ing. Five meta-analyses found no excess IHD risk, and four found no excess stroke risk. There was no excess oral or head and neck cancers, pancreatic or colon cancer, but raised risk of rectal cancer in one study and harms to respiratory disease from snus use . There was robust evidence from pooled studies for a protective effect of snus against the development of Parkinson’s disease by more than 50% . The differences in detrimental health outcomes seen between snus users in Sweden and other parts of Europe compared to elsewhere may in part be attributable to the different chemical content . US studies showed more mixed results from SLT- product use with some evidence of harmful health out- comes. Meta-analyses and longitudinal studies showed mixed results for overall mortality, and mortality due to CHD, overall cancer and smoking-related cancers but no excess risk of respiratory or CVD mortality. Risk of non- fatal CVD were also mixed but the most rigorous study reported elevated risk for both IHD and stroke . A single cross-sectional study reported reduced hyperten- sion rates in SLT-product users. There were mixed results for oral and head and neck cancers ranging from no excess risk to a pooled odds ratio of 1.8 . No studies of more novel products such as tobacco-free nicotine pouches were captured. Of the 53 studies, none reported on the health impact of switching from ciga- rettes to SLT-products. Levels of evidence, quality and study design No studies were above 2a for level of evidence . There were no meta-analyses, pooled studies, or indeed indi- vidual interventional studies, which perhaps reflects difficulty conducting these in real world settings. Meta- analyses comprised the most common study design 21 studies; despite being large, including over 30 studies 14, 53 and 350,000 participants 54, 55, only five of the 21 meta-analyses rated as ‘good’ 10, 12, 21, 47, 55. Particularly problematic themes included pooling differ- ent SLT-products, failing to account for heterogeneity of studies, pooling studies despite variation in sampling methodologies, and failing to report country-specific results, even when these were available. Case–control and cross-sectional studies also predomi- nated, both which are problematic in terms of account- ing for bias, such as failing to account for temporality of exposure and outcome, as well as former smoking sta- tus, rendering cross-sectional studies inappropriate for causal inferences. Two-thirds of global and half of AMEA region studies were rated as being of ‘poor’ quality; all studies exclusively from Europe and two-thirds of those from USA were rated as ‘good’ or ‘fair’. Definitions of exposures Studies frequently failed to account for quantity and duration of SLT-product use, dual and former use of cig- arettes, and in former smokers, duration since quitting. Standard definitions exist for smoking that consider both quantity and duration and similar approaches should be used for SLT-products. Furthermore, a strong dose response effect has been demonstrated in several studies Hajat et al. Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 for both quantity and duration of SLT-product use in AMEA, which should form part of the measurement of exposure. Accounting for smoking status Indian SLT-product users often smoke concurrently 59, 60 and it is essential for both dual and former cigarette use to be accounted for when investigating health out- comes. Of snus use in Sweden, 82% were former or dual users of cigarettes . In our review, only nine studies accounted for both former and current smoking, four out of 11 studies in USA and Europe, and six out of 49 studies from global and AMEA regions. Publication bias No formal evidence for publication bias was found in many of the meta-analyses in our review. However, the small number of studies investigating SLT-products in Sweden, Europe and US suggests that this is an under- researched area and the preponderance of reporting on negative outcomes could indicate the presence of publi- cation bias. Role of SLT‑products in reducing smoking rates SLT-product use in India represents two-thirds of all global SLT use with prevalence rates of 30% in men and 13% in women, exceeding those for cigarettes 7% men, 0.6% women and bidis 14% men, 1.2% women. The use of snus by smokers has been associated with decreased cigarette smoking and increased abstinence of smoking 63–69. Other studies do not support some of these findings 68, 70, 71. Some have postulated snus use in Sweden has led to low smoking prevalence rates through a “reverse gateway” effect . The low preva- lence of smoking in favour of snus use in Sweden com- pared to the rest of Europe may have contributed to its lower rates of tobacco-attributable deaths 72/100,000 Sweden, 128/100,000 EU and cancer-specific deaths 14/100,000 Sweden, 36/100,000 EU in men in 2019 . This strengthens the argument for safer forms of SLT-products such as Swedish snus to be used as a form of tobacco harm reduction on the pathway to stopping smoking. Indeed, data from Swedish longitudinal stud- ies show in primary smokers who started secondary snus use, 10.6% reduced to occasional smoking and 76.3% stopped smoking altogether . Furthermore, between use during 7 years of follow up 5, 74, Modelling has suggested switching from smoking to Swedish snus is likely to result in net health gains . Informing Policy The findings of our review have implications for policy makers. SLT-products are subject to regulations with regard to sales restrictions, advertising, packaging and labelling. Sweden has demonstrated that through strong regulation of composition, SLT-product-related harm has been minimised . The Tobacco Products Directive TPD in the European Union has issued a total ban on Swedish snus outside of Sweden whilst allow- ing South-East Asian SLT-products , a policy which is contradicted the findings of our review and previous scientific evidence. The findings of this review, together with growing evidence of their role in reducing smoking rates, do not support the continuation of a ban on Swed- ish snus and other tobacco harm reduction products as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking. Strengths and limitations It’s a challenge to estimate the risk of disease attributable to such a heterogeneous risk factor such as SLT-products . Any review involving SLT-products will be limited by these issues, unless a single product is studied such as the European snus or the Asian naswar . The output of our systematic review is thus limited due to its reliance on studies which have reported on heterogenous SLT- products. Furthemore, a meta-analysis of included stud- ies could not be undertaken due to the methodological flaws and vast heterogeneity between studies. We summarized findings by region and reported on different products as the best ‘fit’ for categorization of SLT-product use. However, this is not perfect due to the changing landscape and product variation within regions. This issue will only be resolved by future studies carefully documenting and reporting separately for each type of SLT-product. We sought to identify only those articles where the main research question was on health outcomes from use of SLT-products. The key health outcomes under inves- tigation were mortality, CVD, respiratory and cancer as these make up the major health concerns from SLT-prod- ucts. We also searched for general health outcomes to identify the breadth of health outcomes being reported. Finally, the search strategy results were limited to Eng- lish language reports, and there is a risk that potentially relevant studies reporting health outcomes with ENDS use were subsequently not included. Conclusion Our review found studies on SLT-product use focus pre- dominantly on negative health impacts and no studies were found on the health impact from switching from cigarettes to SLT-products. The strength of evidence and Hajat et al. Harm Reduction Journal 2021 18:123 quality of the published studies are generally poor, par- ticularly for global studies and those from Asia, Middle East and Africa. moist snuff use, where ’snus’ the generic term for moist snuff in Swedish, pronounced ’snoose’ is essentially the only type of SLT-product in use . Our review found large differences on the impact on health outcomes between different SLT-products in dif- ferent regions. Use of SLT-products in Asia, Middle East and Africa region is associated with harmful health out- comes including higher overall and cancer mortality, CVD morbidity, and greatly increased morbidity from most smoking-related cancers, in particular oral can- cer. In stark contrast, SLT-products used in Sweden and other parts of Europe such as snus have not been shown on the whole to cause higher mortality or morbidity from CVD or most cancers with evidence for a protec- tive effect against the development of Parkinson’s disease. SLT-product use in the US shows more mixed results for mortality, CVD and cancer outcomes with a higher risk than for Europe but substantially lower than those from SE Asia, Middle East and Africa. Further studies are required to investigate health out- comes from switching from cigarettes to SLT-products and to investigate the full breadth of health outcomes. The wider impacts from SLT-product use on society, such as new uptake in never smokers and nicotine addiction as must also be considered. Considering the widespread and increasing use of SLT-products in certain parts of the world, there is far less evidence base for their impact on health outcomes compared with cigarette smoking, which is in part due to their predominant use in developing countries. However, the emergence of SLT-products as a driver for reduced smoking rates in Sweden and other parts of Europe war- rant further clarification of risk from specific and novel SLT-products. Appendix 1 There are numerous types of SLT-products available globally which differ markedly in terms of their prepara- tion, method of use and toxicity . Indian SLT-products undergo fermentation which affects the production of potential carcinogens called tobacco-specific nitrosamines TSNAs 84, 85 and are often combined with additives such as betel leaf Piper betle, sliced areca nut Areca catechu and/or powdered agricultural lime , which further enhances their tox- icity and psychotropic effect 87, 88. Even in western countries, SLT-products are not a homogeneous category . In the US, three traditional types of SLT-products are used: powdered dry snuff, loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff although use of the former two has rapidly declined . In Scandi- navia, especially in Sweden, there is a long tradition of In the US, dry snuff is made from fermented, fire-cured tobacco that is pulverized into powder. Loose-leaf chew- ing tobacco consists of air-cured leaf tobacco. Moist snuff usually consists of fire-cured dark tobaccos and is used by a ’pinch’ between the thumb and forefinger and plac- ing inside the lip . The fermentation of traditional American products results in higher concentrations of unwanted bacterially mediated by-products, especially TSNAs and nitrite. In Swedish manufacturing of snus air cured tobacco leaves are subjected to pasteurization, yielding virtually sterile products containing very low levels of TSNAs. The man- ufacturing of Swdish snus does not involve fermentation. Instead, the air cured tobacco leaves are subjected to a heating process pasteurization, yielding virtually sterile products containing very low levels of TSNAs. Further, in Sweden’s manufacturing of snus the tobacco leaves are processed according to Swedish legal regulations for food products and the rigorous, industry standard “Gothi- aTek”. Therefore, physical and chemical characteristics of US and Swedish snus products can vary considerably and should not be considered “equivalent” . Other SLT-products also exist, for example, traditional tobacco pouches may contain moist or dry snuff, or small pieces of leaf tobacco and pellets of compressed tobacco. Nicotine pouches contain either tobacco-derived nico- tine or synthetic nicotine, but no tobacco leaf, dust, or stem, and are described as either similar to or being a tobacco-free version of snus. The commonest SLT-products globally are shown in Table 1 Copied from: IARC Monographs on the Evalua- tion of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans .
