There is a substantial body of research on the harmful physical health effects of vaping, but there are relatively few studies on its mental health effects, particularly in adolescents 10e21 years of age. The purpose of this review is to examine the negative effects of vaping on mental health, in particular depression and suicidality. Using the databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and the search engine Google Scholar, we focused on observational studies looking into association between vaping, depression and suici- dality. We found 7255 studies; after removing duplicates and other irrelevant articles, 106 articles were left. After reviewing the abstracts and titles, 99 citations were manually removed, 7 studies were included in the ﬁnal review. Suicide attempts were signiﬁcantly higher among e-cigarette users compared to non-users. E-cigarette use was associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Suicide attempts were signiﬁcantly higher among e-cigarette users compared to non-users. It is critical to raise awareness about the association between electronic cigarettes and adolescent mental health. Keywords: Vaping, Electronic cigarettes, Mental health, Depression, Suicidality 1. Introduction V aping devices, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems, are used to inhale vapors containing nicotine and other potentially harmful substances.1 These devices, more commonly known as e-cigarettes electronic cigarettes, were introduced to primarily assist adult smokers in quitting the use of combustible tobacco cigarettes.1 Vape pens, e-hookahs, pod mods, and tanks are some other names for these devices. These are bat- tery-powered devices containing a proprietary liquid that is heated into an aerosol that users inhale.2 The cartridges' liquid commonly contains propylene List of abbreviations: AOR, Adjusted odds ratio; CC, Combustible cigarettes; CI, Conﬁdence interval; EC, Electronic cigarettes; EVALI, E-cigarette or vaping use associated lung injury; FDA, Food and drug administration, Received 14 July 2021; revised 12 November 2021; accepted 19 November 2021.

Volatile organic products, heavy metals nickel and lead, Diethylene glycol, acrolein, and diacetyl are also harmful ingredients.2 The use of e-cigarettes among adolescents is on the rise. According to the 2019 National Youth To- bacco Survey more than 5 million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2019.3 Some of the reasons for the signiﬁcant increase in adolescent vaping include 1 misconceptions about the safety of e-cigarettes, 2 lower prices than traditional ciga- rettes, 3 a variety of ﬂavors such as fruits and candy, and 4 social or peer pressure.4 Eight out of every ten users preferred ﬂavored e-cigarettes, with menthol being the most popular ﬂavor.3 Vaping has been shown to have numerous harmful effects on the physical and mental health of individuals. E-cigarette or Vaping use Associated Lung Injury EVALI was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 2019.5 A total of 2807 EVALI hospitalized cases, or deaths have been reported since February 2020.2 Addi- tionally, nicotine one of the components of E-ciga- rettes use in adolescents has been shown to cause severe impairment to the growing brain leading to cognitive and psychiatric issues6 like depression, anxiety, violence, other substance abuse, and suici- dality.7 Because of the growing public health crisis and health consequences, the Food and Drug Administration FDA recommended a ban on most ﬂavored vaping cartridges and pods in 2020.4 To protect youth from the harmful side effects of vap- ing, the minimum age for purchasing tobacco-con- taining products was raised from 18 to 21 years old.4 This review aims to present comprehensive evi- dence from the literature on the association of e- cigarette use and mental health outcomes particu- larly depression and suicidality. We hope to raise awareness among adolescents, their parents, teach- ers, healthcare providers, and the entire community and subsequently decrease the incidence of mental health disorders associated with the use of EC through various public health measures. 2. Methods We use the Preferred Reporting Items for System- atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement 2020.8 A review of white literature was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane library, and for grey literature Google Scholar was utilized, with a focus on studies on E-cigarettes and their mental health consequences. The review included observational studies that looked at the impact of vaping on adolescent mental health, particularly depression and suicidality. This review included studies published in the previous 5 years up until April 30, 2021, examining the impact of vaping on adolescent mental health. Search terms included: Vaping OR Electronic cigarettes OR E-cigarettes AND Depression AND Suicidality. Two authors SJ and SU blindly screened all articles obtained from the search using titles and abstracts to identify rele- vant articles for full-text consideration. Disagree- ments were resolved through discussion, and a consensus was reached. On the initial search, we found 7255 articles in the literature; after removing duplicates and other irrelevant articles, we were left with 106 articles. 99 citations were manually removed after reviewing the abstracts and titles. The ﬁnal re- view included 7 studies in total see Fig. 1. 3. Results The characteristics of included studies are listed in Table 1. Synthesis of key ﬁndings is presented below. 3.1. Depression Five of the seven studies included depression as a primary outcome. Lechner et al. 2017, discovered that continued use of electronic cigarettes EC with or without concurrent use of CC worsened depres- sive symptoms, resulting in a deterioration of the individual's mental health.9 Lechner and colleagues showed a bidirectional relationship between EC use and depression and noticed that adolescents who were depressed were more likely to initiate EC use and dual-use than non-users. They found that the past 30-day frequency of EC use was positively associated with depressive symptoms at the ﬁnal follow-up. The authors suggested a longer follow- up period to observe depressive symptoms. These ﬁndings were reinforced by many other studies i.e., Lee & Lee, 2019; Chadi et al., 2019 and Jee, 2016, all of whom reported ﬁnding higher levels of depres- sion in EC users.10e12 Female EC users, as compared to males, were found to have a greater risk of mental health issues, including depression and suicide ideation.10,11,13 Leventhal et al. 2016 reported higher internal- izing outcomes of depression in EC only users compared to non-users.14 However, these outcomes were lower compared to CC only or dual users p 0.0001.14 Also, the prevalence of mental health issues including depression, anhedonia was found to be higher in EC users compared to non-users.14 The risk of developing depression or anxiety was JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES 2022;12:33e39 E L C I T R A W E I V E R Fig. 1.

Depression and suicidality Some studies analyzed both depression and sui- cide as their primary outcomes. Lee & Lee 2019 found that male adolescents, who were EC-only users had a higher suicide attempt prevalence of 5.9%, whereas female adolescents showed the prev- alence of suicide planning of 16.8% and suicide attempt of 14.3%.10 Male dual users showed the highest prevalence in the depression of 34.2%, sui- ideation of 16.1%, and suicide planning of cidal 7.0%.10 Female dual users showed the highest prev- alence in the depression of 53.2% and suicidal idea- tion of 29.4% 53.2% and 29.4%, respectively.10 EC only users compared to non-EC or CC users were associated with depression, suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempt. EC current users compared to non-EC or CC users were associated with depression, suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempt. The adjusted Odds Ratio AOR for suicide plans and attempts were much higher in female than male EC users. Alternatively, Leventhal et al. 2016 described lower levels of internalizing E L C I T R A W E I V E R symptoms depression, GAD, panic disorder, social phobia, OCD in EC users compared to CC and dual users.14 Overall, it was found that adolescents who used ECs were more likely to consider attempting suicide and had a higher-than-average number of suicide attempts.11e13,15 4. Discussion There has been an alarming increase in the popularity and usage of e-cigarettes among adoles- cents 10e21 years of age. In addition to the detri- mental physical effects, e-cigarettes have been found to have a negative impact on mental health among this age group. EC is advertised in attractive packaging with a variety of unique ﬂavors, which entices curious adolescents who want to try nicotine and smoking products. The use of EC has been particularly promoted by social media fads in which 'inﬂuencers' encourage teenagers to use e-cigarettes in the belief that it is safe and socially acceptable. The risk of EC use is greater in adolescents with impulsive personality traits as they tend to initiate EC at an earlier age and use them more often.16 At present, there are more than 30 annual vaping conventions in the US; vape clubs tend to hold na- tional and local conventions with upwards of thou- sands of attendees at each event. This is of drastic concern to public health and healthcare workers due to the emerging vaping culture and its connection to adverse mental health outcomes.17 Flavors such as “captain crunch berries” and “cookies and cream” appeal to audiences in middle and high school that have a high rate of e-cigarette update.17 A systematic thematic analysis of 808 e-cigarette/ vaping-related videos in TikTok that is a video sharing service presented a synthesis of likes, themes, and categories of the users.18 The study the shortlisted videos were viewed found that around 1.5 billion times; moreover, 63% of the videos depicted vaping in a positive manner. The themes in the videos included 52% being comedic, 20% showing vaping tricks, 20% targeting nicotine and addiction, 16% being creative in nature, and only 11% had a warning.18 The ﬁndings illustrate the vaping and e-cigarette postings are available without age restrictions in TikTok, a video-sharing platform that is popular among adolescents; effective disclaimers and age restrictions ought to be imposed by public health professionals to reduce exposure to positive vaping portrayals.18 There is compelling evidence from published data that there is a higher incidence of depression in R E V I E W A R T I C L E JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES 2022;12:33e39 adolescent users of ECs than in those who do not use these products.9e12 Adolescents who have pre- existing depression or depressive symptoms are more likely to begin using ECs, suggesting a bi- directional relationship between depression and EC use.9 An association between suicidality and e-ciga- rette use has been observed in adolescents, with increased suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicidal attempts. A higher rate of suicidality has been observed among dual users.10 Lee and Lee examine the relationship between suicidality and depression among Korean adolescents from the 2017 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Including a total of 62,276 students, signiﬁcant dif- ferences were found among users where dual EC and CC users had a higher prevalence of suicidality and depression for both current and lifetime users. Whereas, EC only users had higher levels of suici- dality and depression compared to non-users. Among female adolescents, CC-only and EC-only users, and dual users had a higher prevalence of suicidality and depression as compared to male ad- olescents.10,13 Lee and Lee's study was the ﬁrst to assess the associations of suicidality and depression to CC and EC use using a nationally representative Korean adolescent sample. The ﬁndings suggest that there is an urgent need for the intervention and evaluation of e-cigarette use by healthcare pro- fessionals to provide smoking cessation programs for users.10,14 This relationship suggests that while exclusive use of ECs is associated with unfavorable psychological outcomes, its use by current or lifetime conventional smokers can lead to a greater exacer- bation of existing symptoms of mental illnesses. Due to the increase in the use of EC and its impact on mental health, multiple policy changes have been implemented in the United States to mitigate the public health threat. These include increasing the minimum age to buy nicotine-based products including e-cigarettes to 21 years of age, and a ban on the sale of disposable and cartridge-based e-ciga- rettes with mint, candy, and fruit ﬂavors.19 Also, the use of packaging with highly identiﬁable logos or cartoon characters has been deemed illegal. How- ever, menthol and tobacco-ﬂavored e-cigarettes and ENDS like open tank vaping systems can still be sold and concerns have been raised that this might lead to teenagers switching to menthol or tobacco ﬂavored pods or even switch to more dangerous and addictive substances. Eliminating the EC from the market might lead to a relapse amongst people who have quit smoking. This could result in a hazardous rise in health issues associated with smoking traditional cigarettes. The implementation warrants new inno- vative preventive strategies.20,21 The most important prevention strategy is educating the youth about the development of po- tential mental health effects or deterioration of pre- existing conditions that can result from using EC. A program like “The Real Cost”, an excellent example, was launched by the FDA in 2014 to educate youth on the dangers of tobacco use. The program aggressively prioritized spreading awareness about e-cigarettes to dispel the misconception that e-cig- arettes are harmless. Similar campaigns at schools and colleges may help reduce the use of EC and prevent the negative impact on the mental health of adolescents. Outreach programs via social media can be an effective way to propagate awareness. Primary care physicians including pediatricians should screen the youth on the usage of EC along with the recom- mended alcohol and drug screens during preventive healthcare visits. The youth must be encouraged to quit the use of vaping devices to avoid dependence on nicotine as a coping strategy. Resources on the symptoms of dependence and withdrawal should be shared with them. Potential breakthrough responses by primary care physicians may be offering insur- ance discounts for those with negative nicotine testing, conducted regularly. It may also be beneﬁ- cial for healthcare professionals to receive addi- tional interviewing to facilitate change among the population that wishes to quit e-cigarettes. training in motivational 4.1. Strengths and limitations Our study is unique as it focuses mainly on the adolescent age group 10e21 years which is the more vulnerable age group. We included studies carried out in different parts of the world to get a broader perspective on this issue. The main limita- tion was the restricted number of studies showing the effect of vaping on adolescent mental health. In the included studies, we did not take into account any pre-existing mental health conditions in ado- lescents to prevent confounding. Another limitation was that we did not consider the frequency of e- cigarette use or the concentration of nicotine because some of the studies had limited data in this regard. 5. Conclusion This review ﬁnds that e-cigarette adolescents are more likely to have mental health problems such as depression and suicidality. The combination of conventional and electronic cigarettes exacerbates females develop higher these conditions. Also, E L C I T R A W E I V E R JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES 2022;12:33e39 adverse effects on mental health as a result of vap- ing. To further understand the mechanisms which lead to mental illness in E-cigarette users, more research needs to be done. Although the FDA has taken commendable steps to restrict adolescent ac- cess to E-cigarettes, more work needs to be done to identify and close loopholes. We anticipate our re- view ﬁndings to be a critical piece of information for healthcare professionals and public health practitioners. Funding No funding was obtained.
