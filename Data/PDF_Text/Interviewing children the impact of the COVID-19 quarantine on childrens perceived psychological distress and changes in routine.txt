Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 Open Access Interviewing children: the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on children’s perceived psychological distress and changes in routine G. Segre, R. Campi, F. Scarpellini, A. Clavenna, M. Zanetti, M. Cartabia and M. Bonati Abstract Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in governments implementing disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children’s mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress anxiety and mood symptoms and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. Methods: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan Italy, attending primary and middle school aged 6 to 14 years, and their parents. Results: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents’ bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 78 % children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. Conclusions: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children’s development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.

Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 Background In December 2019, the outbreak of a new strain of corona- virus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 virus was first reported in Wuhan, China and spread across the world within a short time; the World Health Organization declared it as a pan- demic COVID-19 on March 12, 2020 . This pandemic has resulted in governments imple- menting disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. In Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, the first school closure began the 21st of February 2020, and, on dents isolated at home for the rest of the academic year, with schooling shifted to home based distance-learning models. The closure of schools was the first mass inter- vention taken towards a target population. School activ- ity was the first to be suspended and the last to be resumed, by not considering how to mitigate the nega- tive impacts of lockdown. There is still significant con- troversy about the role of children in spreading the virus, also at school: evidence is emerging that children may be significantly less likely to become infected than adults, and do not appear to be super spreaders . On the one side, it is suggested that children may play and attenuating role both with respect to epidemiological and clinical dynamics. On the other side, some of these effects may be age dependent, with younger children more likely candidates for a lesser role in transmission . According to the United Nations Educational, Scien- tific and Cultural Organization due to the COVID-19 schools have been suspended nationwide in 188 coun- tries: affecting more than more than 1.5 billion children and adolescents worldwide, who found themselves iso- lated at home. Moreover, the lockdown and school clos- ure may have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education, and their men- tal health . The COVID-19 pandemic may worsen existing mental health problems and lead to more cases among children and adolescents because of the unique combination of uncertainty, anxiety, fear of becoming ill or seeing a loved one become sick, loss of our everyday routines, difficulties in maintaining social connection, and economic recession . After the H1N1 and SARS epidemics, post-traumatic stress is estimated to be four times higher in children who have been in quarantine compared to those who have not, and their likelihood of presenting acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and grief is also higher . A recent review highlighted that children and adoles- cents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after enforced iso- lation ends . The authors found a clear association between loneliness and mental health problems, mostly depression, in children and adolescents. Loneliness was associated with future mental health problems up to 9 years later. A Chinese survey conducted during COVID-19 directly involved primary school students and reported higher rates of depressive 22.6 % and anxiety 18.9 % symptoms compared with the prevalence in other surveys. Italy was the first European country to implement a national lockdown to contain the spread of severe cor- onavirus disease 19 COVID-19 and related strict do- mestic quarantine policies. feelings of To date, only a few studies 10–13 have drawn atten- tion to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children’s mental health. A recent study has examined the psychological effects of the quarantine in youth from Italy and Spain. Data were collected through a survey completed by parents and found that their children had different symptoms such as: difficulty concentrating 76.6 %, boredom 52 %, irritability 39 %, restlessness 38.8 %, nervousness loneliness 38 %, 31.3 %, uneasiness 30.4 %, and worries 30.1 %. More- over, the results show that children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quar- antine 10. Similarly, another Italian study sug- gested that during the lockdown children exhibited a marked delay in sleep timing and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect daily rou- tines or to keep track of the passage of time. An increase in emotional, conduct and hyperactive symptoms in chil- dren, together with regressive behaviours was reported, which was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers’ psychological difficulties. The social distancing and stay-at-home orders issued in cities across the globe obviously reduce the opportun- ities for physical activity among children, particularly for children in urban areas living in small apartments. Isola- tion and shielding could result in increased sedentary behaviours and food consumption, which are likely to impact weight and consequently health and sleep over time 14, 15. During the pandemic, the prevalence of physically in- active students from 21.3 to increased extensively, 65.6 %. Overall screen time increased considerably dur- ing the pandemic and screen time during leisure was also prolonged, indicating that nearly a quarter of stu- dents engaged in long screen time for leisure . To date, the majority of knowledge available from re- search related to the health needs and experiences of young children has been based on the perspectives of parents and/or paediatric health professionals. A grow- ing number of researchers in the health care field have Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 begun to capture the children’s perspectives through in- terviews 16, 17. For this reason, we decided to directly involve children and adolescents with video-interviews to convey their experiences and to more fully understand their needs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly investigates the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on children’s and adolescents’ perceived changes in routine and mental health from their own perspective. In par- ticular, the added value of the study is the fact that it directly involved students with video-interviews, letting them share their needs and opinions. The present study aims to analyse the impact of the quarantine on students’ life in Milan, one of the Italian cities most affected by COVID-19. In particular, we fo- cused our attention on their perception of changes in routine during the lockdown: distance learning, eating and sleeping habits. Psychological distress such as anx- iety and mood symptoms, disease concern, regressive be- haviours, and fears were examined. We hypothesized that quarantine period and school closure could have a negative impact on perceived changes in routine and on children’s emotional and behavioral well-being. More- over we aimed to explore what are the things that chil- dren missed the most and what they expected to do as soon as quarantine gets over, in order to highlight their priorities. Methods Study design This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020, for a total of 3 weeks. 18th of May was a meaningful date in Italy: it corresponded to the beginning of the second phase of the lockdown. From May 18th shops reopened as well as cafès and restaurants and people were allowed to go outside with- out the previously required form justifying their reasons, and meeting up with friends was permitted. During this period students were still attending their online classes. This cross-sectional study used structured interviews, conducted by two psychologists GS and FS, Doctors of Clinical and Psychology. Interviews were about 10 to answers where recorded by researchers on a question- naire form ad hoc created during the interviews. Stu- dents and their parents were at home during the interviews, conducted with a video-meeting platform Zoom. Scientific literature related to the psychological impact of quarantine was reviewed and ad-hoc interviews were created in order to investigate changes in routine of chil- dren and adolescents and psychological reactions due to the coronavirus lockdown. Inclusion and exclusion criteria To be included in the study participants have to be pri- mary or middle school students data were collected from across all eight school year levels living in Milan Lombardy, Italy. Those children and their parents were recruited via different channels newsletter, website, and social networks of the Laboratory for Mother and Child Health of the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. Partici- pants were excluded if they were not able or were not willing to attend the Zoom video. Procedure Before conducting the interviews with study participants, a pilot study was conducted to test the interview design with four students two males and two females of differ- ent grades: at the end participants were asked whether the questions were clear and made them comfortable. The parent was involved at the beginning of the inter- view in order to introduce the child and reply to a few quick questions: COVID-19 cases within the family con- text, developmental disorders of the child such as spe- cific needs, residency, and type of school attended by the child pri- vate/state school. disorder/special educational learning The child directly responded to the main part of the interview, which investigated: Socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, school grade, house and family situation information on people living with the respondent during the lockdown, and average screen time per day. Socioeconomic data, such as household income and the number of rooms in the house, were not collected. Perceived changes in routine during the lockdown – Three questions compared distance learning with normal schooling, and concerned: a difficulty in maintaining attention during online lessons than before yes/no; b students’ tiredness and fatigue, for example “Compared to normal schooling, is distance schooling more tiring?” yes/no; and c their motivation and commitment to remote schooling, for example “Compared to normal schooling, do you feel less committed and motivated to online school? yes/no – For those who responded positively to all the above questions, adjustment to online schooling was a real struggle. – The interviews investigated the perceived eating habits during quarantine: quantity for example, “In this quarantine period you were eating as normal or more/less than you used to do before?” and quality “Do you eat the same things that you were used to eat before or more junk food?” of food Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 consumption. We focused on those subjects who were not eating the same as before and reported an increase in junk food and sweets. – Concerning sleeping habits, we analysed whether there had been changes in sleep patterns or the child/adolescent was sleeping the same as before “Do you sleep more/less than usual or the same as before?” If there had been changes we asked if they were related to difficulties in falling asleep “Do you have difficulties in falling asleep?“ or waking up many times during the night, or with having more nightmares than usual. Moreover, we also asked the responder if during the quarantine he or she had wished to sleep in his parents’ bed, which could be considered as a regressive behaviour. Emotional and behavioural changes Six items were adapted from the anxiety clinical scale of the “Trauma and symptom checklist for children” . A 4-point Likert-type scale was employed to measure the anxiety level: 0 “never”, 1 “sometimes”, 2 “lots of times”, 3 “almost all the time”. We divided the scores into 3 main categories: normal anxiety 0–9, mild to moderate anxiety 10–14, and severe anxiety 15–18: a subject scored positive for anxiety if the total score was ≥ 10. Concerning mood symptoms, six items were adapted from the “Short Mood and feeling questionnaire” in order to investigate whether during the quarantine there had been changes. In particular, we explored if the par- ticipant felt that was crying more often than before, had lost interest in doing things that they usually enjoyed, was more irritable or tired during quarantine, reported poor concentration or had mood swings. Possible an- swers were 1 “yes” and 2 “no”, with a total score ranging from 0 to 6. Mood symptoms were considered clinically significant if the total score was ≥ 4 positive scoring on at least four out of six questions. Statistical analyses Data are reported as number and percentage of re- sponders. Data analysis was performed using frequency distributions for categorical variables summarized using proportions and associations tested using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test where applicable. Continuous vari- ables were summarized using means, standard devia- tions, and median. To identify factors influencing psychological distress anxiety and mood symptoms we computed odd ratios OR considering the significance of the confidence in- tervals CI. Statistical significance was evaluated using a 95 % con- fidence interval and a two-tailed p-value of 0.05. SAS software, version 9.4 SAS, Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA was used for all statistical analyses. Ethical aspects This study followed the criteria for reporting observa- tional studies STROBE, additional file 1. The ethics committee of the Besta Neurological Institute in Milan approved the study protocol Report number 73. Ac- cording to the Italian laws and good ethical practice, a written and informed consent of the parents was re- quired via email before participation in the study. The invitation included an information leaflet explaining the nature of the interviews, who would be present and what to expect, making it clear that participants could stop the interview at any time and the link to connect at the scheduled date, and time of the video-interview. More- over, before the interview we introduced the aims of the study to the interviewed youth and asked them consent to be involved in the present study. Results Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample In total 82 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 14 mean age of 10.4 years were interviewed; of whom 53.7 % were males and 46.3 % were females. Just over half of students 54.9 % went to primary school and 45.1 % to middle school. Most 72 % were attending public schools. All students were living in Milan Italy. In particular, 53 64.6 % were living in the urban area of Milan, while 29 35.4 % in the metropolitan area. A minority of the students 11 % had specific learning disorders or special educational needs. Most 89 % had brothers or sisters; the majority of them 78 % had parents who were work- ing during the lockdown. 68.3 % of the subjects spent less than 2 h per day on leisure screen time, but 26 re- spondents 31.7 % reported spending more than two hours a day in front of screens, excluding hours of on- line lessons and homework. Of the 82 children and adolescents who participated in the study, 3 3.6 % tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus and 1214.6 % had close relatives who had been in- fected. This means that 7 respondents had been exposed to COVID-19 without contracting the disease. Perceived changes in routine: Concerning changes in routine during the lockdown we considered different areas: cid:1 Distance learning: 65 respondents 79.3 % reported that it was more difficult to focus during online lessons, 53 64.6 % found it more tiring, and almost half of the children and adolescents 47.3 % felt less committed to remote schooling. 27 subjects Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 32.9 % responded positively to all the questions related to online schooling, meaning that those students struggled to adjust to home learning. cid:1 Eating habits: the perception of changes in eating habits was observed in 63.4 % of the population, mainly in primary school students OR = 0.38, 95 % C.I: 0.152–0.966, p = .04. In particular, more than half of the sample 57.3 % reported eating more during the lockdown, with an increase in consumption of junk food, snacks, and sweets. 36 responders 43.9 % completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. cid:1 Sleeping habits: Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures. 50 respondents 61 % reported changes in sleep pattern: the majority of them had difficulties in falling asleep and woke up many times during the night. They went to bed later than before, but due to school lessons had to wake up at around the same time in the morning. Moreover, nearly half of the sample 48.8 % reported that during the quarantine they wished to sleep in their parents’ bed. In total 23 children and adolescents 28 % had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep their parents’ bed. Fears and symptoms: The main fear, shared by the 75.6 % of the sample, is the thought that their family members could fall ill with COVID-19. Children and adolescents were more fright- ened than before for their family than for themselves; only 18.3 % of the respondents replied that they were mostly terrorized by the idea of being hospitalized. 18 22 % subjects had normal scores of anxiety Table 1, the mean score was 11.56 2.65 s.d.. 54 scored mild to moderate, and 10 had severe anxiety symptoms: in total 78 % reported mild to severe anxiety during quarantine. It could be that the pandemic and the related stress and vulnerability to virus could have exacerbated previous symptoms; it is even possible that those symptoms were not present before, but arose due to the isolation condi- tion. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels between males and females, nor between primary and middle school students. None of the following char- acteristics Table 1 is significantly associated with anx- iety levels. In particular, 30.5 % of the responders reported that al- most all of the time they felt afraid that something bad might happen and felt afraid of the dark. – 36 responders 43.9 % had significant mood symptoms Table 2, the mean score was 3.43 1.62 s.d.. The higher frequency of mood symptoms was mainly associated with screen usage OR = 0.35, 95 % C.I: 0.13–0.91, p = .03 and with changes in dietary habits: in quantity OR = 4.14, 95 % C.I: 1.51–11.35, p = .0057, quality OR = 3.90, 95 % C.I: 1.50-10.12, p = .0051 and both OR = 5.67, 95 % C.I: 2.18–14.74, p .001. – Interestingly, nearly three-quarters of the inter- viewed 73.2 % reported getting angry more easily than they usually do. The majority of them 90.2 % reported missing their friends a lot, and almost two third 72 % reported missing their hobbies and ex- tracurricular activities sports or language courses a lot. A feedback on the study’s findings was provided to participants and interested people throughout a public national webinar. Discussion lThis is the first study to directly investigate, from the viewpoint of Italian primary and middle school students, the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the per- ceived changes in their routine and psychological dis- tress. Italy was, after China, the second most highly affected country at the time, with the pandemic spread- ing very fast around Milan, one of the most involved cit- ies. In that period, the emergency level was very high and Italian population was living in an unusual situation. The preventive measures were very tight, people had to remain at home and it was forbidden for children to go outside to the park or meeting friends. These preventive measures were necessary to avoid the spreading of the virus, but they were very struggling for the youngest. Even if there is still significant controversy about the role of children in spreading the virus, school closures resolution showed that in that period children were con- sidered the main spreaders , impacting their worries about infecting their parents and grandparents. Results of our research reveal that children were more con- cerned for their loved ones health condition than for their own. For most children and youth, the normal routine was disrupted: with the implementation of social distancing interventions, direct human contact became highly re- stricted, with most activities that typically occupy youths’ lives – schooling, and socialization with peers – transitioning to electronic- based platforms. extracurricular activities, Routine normally gives the young an increased feeling of safety in the context of uncertainty. Consistent evi- dence demonstrates that the structured environment of weekdays may help to protect children by regulating obesogenic behaviours, most likely through compulsory physical activity opportunities, restricting caloric intake, Segre et al.

For this reason, most of the guidelines recommend creating new routines and structures each day to adapt to the pandemic situation. Our results show that almost half of responders com- pletely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown, eating different amounts of food and consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lock- down measures, with changes in sleep pattern, especially concerning difficulties in falling asleep and waking up many times during the night. Many children and adoles- cents also wished to sleep in their parents’ bed. The findings of the present study are consistent with an- other Italian survey, completed by parents of 2 to 14 years old children ; they suggested that one in four children 26.5 % showed the regressive symptom of the demand for physical proximity to their parents during the night, and almost one in five 18.2 % manifested fears that they had never had before. Half of the children 53.5 % showed increased irritability, intolerance to rules, whims and ex- cessive demands, and one in five presented mood changes 21.2 % and sleep problems, including difficulty in falling asleep, agitation, and frequent waking up 20 %. Accord- ing to the literature, we can confirm our expectations among negative consequences on perceived changes habits due to the quarantine period. The current study strongly supports the hypothesis positing that the COVID-19 pandemic will “exacerbate all of the risk factors for weight gain associated with summer recess” . Specifically, a longitudinal study of children and adolescents with obesity affirmed that eat- ing, activity, and sleep behaviors changed in an unfavor- able direction 3 weeks into their confinement during the national lockdown . Are changes in sleep temporary, or will a subset of youth experience longer-term sleep disturbances that the COVID-19 pandemic? Will originated during changes in sleep patterns such as an increasingly late bedtime in adolescents result in difficulties once nor- mality starts to return e.g., when schools reopen and early mornings are required once more . Moreover, the reduction of outdoor activities and so- cial interaction may have been associated with an in- crease in children’s emotional and behavioral difficulties. Our findings showed mostly mild to moderate anxiety symptoms, but also significant anxiety in some youth, and nearly half of the responders reported frequent mood swings. Compared to previous research conducted before the pandemic, this study found high levels of self-reported anxiety. The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety and depressive disorder among children according to Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual DSM and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD was shown to be 6.5 and 2.6 % respect- ively . However, the criteria for DSM and ICD were not used in the current study and children reported their symptoms focusing on their own perspective, compared to how they felt before the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results reveal higher rates of perceived symptoms than those found in another survey conducted in China with primary school students during the Coronavirus-19 outbreak , although these studies cannot be compared due to different assessment tools. This study suggested that 403 Chinese students 22.6 % and 337 students 18.9 % showed depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Our findings are not consistent with those of a Chin- ese study in which secondary school students yielded the highest prevalence and levels of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, and primary school students the lowest : in the current study we didn’t find any significant difference in symptomatology between primary and mid- dle school students. There is mounting evidence of in- creased mental health problems during the acute stages of COVID-19 6, 9, 24. For a subset of children and youth, however, the consequences of pandemic-related stress will not be immediately observable, and will only be detectable following a certain period of development. It is important to highlight that the presence of de- pressive symptoms even if sub-threshold or psycho- logical unease in a few children may be hidden by an stress apparently adaptive behavior.

The results confirm our expec- tations about psychological distress generated by the quarantine period. Moreover, these results highlight that the most important things for children and adolescents are social interactions, what they missed the most are friends, sports and school. There is a pressing need for giving importance to the children priorities. Strengths and limitations There are several limitations to this study. Socioeconomic details such as household income and number of rooms in the house were not collected, and these data could be helpful in planning future require- ments with respect to quarantine. Moreover, this could be considered as a potential limit because of the findings are less generalizable and slightly representative of chil- dren in Milan. We could not calculate how many people refused to participate because we’ve advertised the study on differ- ent channels and only those parents and children who wanted to be enrolled contacted us. prior baseline data Our evaluation was conducted in the first phase of the pandemic, unfortunately the COVID-19 outbreak are not available. This has a sig- nificant impact, since we can’t guarantee that the per- ceived symptomatology arose in the quarantine and was not even present before. The results indicate the changes that the children, themselves perceived, but without an appropriate comparison or a baseline measure, we can- not be certain that these perceptions were actually reflected in reality. Another limitation is that our current study could not evaluate whether these outcomes will be long-lasting after the COVID-19 outbreak. It will be in- teresting to continue to follow up with these participants to improve our understanding about how long these outcomes will last. 25.0 75.0 66.7 33.3 42.7 57.3 43.9 56.1 Reference 3.90 1.50-10.12 0.0051 5.67 2.18-14.74 0.0004 Reference Implications and future research direction The COVID-19 crisis highlights that school fulfils not only an educational mission of knowledge acquisition, but it also satisfies the socialisation needs of young people. School provides a structured setting in which children can learn and develop social self- confidence, friendship, empathy, participation, respect, gratitude, compassion, and responsibility . such as skills, Children facing unexpected and unknown events typ- ically exhibit various stress reactions: resilience, the per- sonal attributes that help children manage everything from little disappointments to big life traumas, should be nurtured and implemented by public health programs in children and teens living in areas hit by calamities such as epidemics. If properly supported by healthcare professionals, families, and other social connections, in- cluding school environment, children and adolescents can appropriately overcome a condition of distress and prospectively stabilize emotionally and physiologically . In conclusion, we would like to highlight that chil- dren with pre-existing mental and physical disability are at utmost risk given the current situation 27, 28. The challenges of online learning coupled with a lack of recreational activities that can be done at home can prove to be frustrating for children with physical disabil- ities. It becomes even more important to keep children with physical and mental disability not only physically safe, but also look after their psychological and emo- tional wellbeing. In particular, social distancing and its effects are extremely novel and difficult to understand for children, especially those experiencing developmental and intellectual delays. This affects their wellbeing and places them at a higher risk for clinically significant mental health issues . Taken into consideration the small number of children with special needs included in the present study, we didn’t find any significant differ- ence amongst children with special needs and the rest of the sample in all the considered variables. This study has highlighted the high levels of perceived distress experi- enced by children during the quarantine; furthermore, it those is necessary to take into consideration that Segre et al. BMC Pediatrics 2021 21:231 symptoms are likely to be exacerbated for children with additional needs, frustrated due to disruptions in their daily routines and possible interruption of their regular therapy sessions. Conclusions In summary, we found that 78 % of the Italian children aged 6 to 14 experienced anxiety symptoms due to the COVID-19 epidemic quarantine measures; nearly half of the sample 43.9 % reported significant mood symp- toms. In general, a large proportion of participants de- scribed having struggled to adjust to home learning and completely changed their dietary and sleeping habits. Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficul- ties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children’s development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.
