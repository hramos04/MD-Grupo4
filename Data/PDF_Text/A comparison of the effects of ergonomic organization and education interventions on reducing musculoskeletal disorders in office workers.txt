Abstract Background: One of the most important and the most common health problems among oﬃce workers and computer users is the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders MSDs. Objectives: This study aimed at evaluating risk factors of MSDs and determining the eﬀectiveness of the ergonomic, organization, education interventions on reducing MSDs in the oﬃce workers of university oﬃces of Tehran, Iran. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 221 employees during spring 2015 to summer 2016. Participants were cat- egorized to four groups by simple random sampling: control group n = 55, recipients of education interventions n = 57, recipients of organization interventions including job enrichment, job enlargement and job rotation n = 54, and recipients of ergonomics interventions n = 55. Rapid oﬃce strain assessment ROSA and Cornell musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaires CMDQ were used for data gathering. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and paired-samples t-test using the SPSS ver- sion 16 software. Results: After the intervention, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was revealed in the ﬁnal mean score for ROSA in the two groups of recipients of education and ergonomic interventions P 0.05. Also, data revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in MSDs, including neck, shoulders, and hand/wrist, among ergonomics and education groups. Conclusions: Educational and ergonomic interventions may reduce ergonomics risk factors of MSDs and prevalence of discomfort. However, according to the results, organizational interventions alone may not be more eﬀective in reducing risk factors of MSDs and their discomforts. The eﬀectiveness of multilayered interventions should be investigated in the future. Keywords: Ergonomics, Health Education, Human Engineering, Musculoskeletal Diseases, Workplace 1. Background One of the important groups of occupational injuries and disabilities in many developing and developed coun- tries is musculoskeletal disorders MSDs, which imposes high economic costs for societies. Given the signiﬁcance of this issue, the World Health Organization WHO in 2013, ranked MSDs as the second most prevalent work-related disease 1. Furthermore, the literature has indicated the importance of controlling and reducing these problems around the world, which is currently a major challenge for ergonomic experts 2-4. According to Moradi et al. 5, MSDs involving the back and waists were highly prevalent amongst mechanics, de- termined using the rapid entire body assessment REBA method. Also, shoulder problems is common amongst Ira- nian students 6. Another study indicated that MSDs in- volving the upper and lower limbs have high prevalence in Iran 7. Studies conducted among oﬃce workers demon- strated that one of the most important and prevalent health problems in computer users is the risk of de- veloping MSDs. National Bureau of Statistics of China announced in a report during year 2007 that 60 % of employees use computers in their workplace 8. It was also revealed that more than half of the employees in EU- member states used computers during their workdays 9. In several studies, using the computer has been associated with an increased prevalence of MSDs 10, 11. Repetitive activities, applying excessive force, poor Copyright © 2018, Authors.

Safarian MH et al. working posture, contact pressures and physical fatigue are among the most important physical risk factors of MSDs in most jobs 12. In computer users, in addition to the aforementioned factors, there are other factors, includ- ing personal factors, such as age, gender, obesity, physi- cal activity, and smoking; and factors related to the design of the workstation, such as position of the monitor, dura- tion of using a computer, numbers of breaks, method of using the keyboard, as well as psychosocial factors 13-15. Designing an ergonomic work space by using engineering approaches is one of the interventions intended to com- pletely eliminate environmental risk factors of the oﬃce environment. Furthermore, the use of organizational con- trols, such as holding workshops to raise knowledge of em- ployees about ergonomic risk factors and about setting up workstations by the employees themselves, as well as job rotation, have been introduced to reduce the risk of MSDs 15, 16. If possible, the combination of educational in- terventions in engineering interventions can serve as the most important and eﬀective factor to improve ergonomic conditions of oﬃce work stations 17-20. In recent studies, the role of job design in increasing job satisfaction of oﬃce workers was well-evaluated 21-24. Ergonomists suggested that in designing interventions to reduce MSDs, the physical and psycho-social aspects of work must simultaneously be concerned 25. One suit- able method to reduce and balance psychological risk fac- tors of the workplace is job design, which can be achieved through job rotation, job development, and job enrich- ment 26. The study of Piranveyseh er al. 27 showed that certain psycho-social factors may be related to the increase in MSDs prevalence. Thus, one must pay simultaneous at- tention to the work’s physical and psychosocial aspects. In another study, Yip et al. 28 revealed that various psy- chosocial factors, such as monotonous work, lack of job satisfaction, and weak support among colleagues can in- crease complaints of lower back pain. 2. Objectives Based on the high requirement of oﬃce workers for im- proving their working conditions, the present study was conducted with the following aims: 1 Assessment of the prevalence of MSDs and evaluation of ergonomic risk fac- tors for oﬃce workstations, and 2 analysis of the eﬀective- ness of education, ergonomic, and organization interven- tions, on reducing MSDs among the staﬀ of Tehran Univer- sity of Medical Sciences Tehran, Iran, separately. 3. Methods 3.1. Study Population This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 240 employees of Tehran University of Medical Sciences with work experience of over one year with more than three hours of working with computers per day. Data was gath- ered during spring 2015 to summer 2016. In total, the sam- ple size was calculated as 240 participants, who were allo- cated to four groups. According to the sample and mean and standard devi- ation SD 3.96, 3.59, 1 of the groups G1, G2, the power of the study was calculated above 80%. Therefore, the sample size is approved 29. In this study, the statistical population was 550 partic- ipants. Overall, 450 participants had the inclusion criteria and others worked in other job positions. Then, after hold- ing meetings with the heads of each of the units, the coop- eration between workstations and communication with the practitioners of every station, participants were di- vided to four groups. Of the total population 450 partici- pants, 95 participants were allocated to the control group, participants to the organization intervention group and 85 to the ergonomics intervention group. Finally, after deter- mining the study population, the inclusion criteria were used for the allocation of samples to each group, and ﬁ- nally 60 participants for each of the four groups 240 in to- tal were selected using the simple random method. Inclusion criteria were work experience of over one year with more than three hours of working with comput- ers per day. Participants s with a history of severe trauma or fracture of the neck, elbows, back and knees, a history of diseases aﬀecting the musculoskeletal system, SLE, os- teoarthritis, diabetes, and gout were excluded. A total of 240 questionnaires were distributed among participants before the interventions. At the end, after four months of intervention, 221 cases entered the statistical analysis stage. Overall, 19 participants were excluded for several reasons, such as being uninterested to continue participation. Considering ethical approval codes, this study was approved at session 418, by the deputy of re- search and technology of Baqiyatallah University of Med- ical Science on the 9th of August 2015. Before data gather- ing, informed consent forms for participation in the study were completed by the participants. After sampling, the study was conducted in the following three steps: Step one: Initial Assessment of the work environment: Demographic and job characteristics: For this purpose, a questionnaire was designed to collect information, such as age, gender, height, weight, and work experience. Health Scope. 2019; 81:e68422. Safarian MH et al. 3.2. Studying the Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Disorders Cornell musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire CMDQ was used to study the degree of musculoskeletal The CMDQ is self-administered and pro- discomfort. vides information about the existence and repetition rates of discomfort, severity of discomfort and its eﬀect on work ability. After determining each section of the questionnaire, the numbers of the three sections must be multiplied together and the ﬁnal results would be a number between 0 and 90 30. Reliability and validity of the Persian version of the questionnaire was determined and reported as acceptable by Aﬁfehzadeh-Kashani et al. 31. Assessing ergonomic risk factors for oﬃce worksta- tions: For this purpose, the rapid oﬃce strain assessment ROSA method was used, which had been designed by Sonne et al. 32 to identify risk factors for oﬃce work and setting priorities for achieving the optimal balance be- tween staﬀ and equipment at a workstation. The validity of the method was conﬁrmed by numerous studies 33-35. Step two: Implementation of interventions: The present study was conducted on four separate groups, including the control group without receiving any intervention n = 55, education intervention group n = 57, the organization intervention group with a focus on job enlargement, job rotation, and job enrichment n = 54, and the ergonomic intervention group n = 55. The study ﬂow diagram is presented in Figure 1. It should be noted that educational intervention was also a part of ad- ministrative controls. Given the aim of the present study, which is a separate evaluation of various ergonomic inter- vention methods, educational and organization interven- tions were assessed separately. The interventions were ad- ministered during a span of two months at the same time, and were as follows: Education intervention: For this purpose, training manuals with the participants of oﬃce ergonomics were distributed among participants. The manual included the following tips: Identifying neutral and inappropriate pos- tures, how to adjust the chair and make appropriate pos- tures while working on a chair, how to set up and arrange objects on the desk, proper positioning of the telephone in relation to the position of the individual, the proper use of the telephone, correct posture for using the mouse and keyboard as well as their proper placement on the desk, the correct way of using the mouse and the key- board, the best angle and distance between the monitor and the user while working, and the proper placement of holder page on the desk. All of these were selected based on the rearrangement of the workstation by the person- nel themselves with regards to the risk factors under study by the ROSA method and using the guideline on oﬃce er- gonomics, as provided by the Canadian Standards Associ- ation 36. In addition, in order to introduce employees to the desk exercises and for a regular practice of these moves, the ErgoPro software was installed on all of their comput- ers. Organization intervention: These interventions were administered according to job enlargement, job enrich- ment, and job rotation. Job enlargement and enrichment are motivational factors that increase motivation and sat- isfaction in individuals to better perform their assigned tasks. Job enlargement and job rotation add more vari- ety of tasks and activities to the job, so that the job will not be tedious. In the present study, the scope of duties and responsibilities assigned to participants in the orga- nization intervention group was increased to prevent the work from being monotonous. For this purpose, the par- ticipants, in addition to their routine tasks, were asked to do other tasks on a rotating basis, such as delivering administrative letters, doing a roll call, and following up on work shortcomings and welfare of colleagues. Also, in some cases, tasks were performed by taking turns and the participants experienced diﬀerent conditions and respon- sibilities. On the other hand, job enrichment adds further in- centives to the work, deepens the job and includes more control, responsibility, and discretion on how to perform a task. This method, unlike job enlargement that easily adds more variety to work, gives individuals greater authority. For this purpose, participants were asked to be present in decision-making meetings about improving the current situation with the supervisor and the manager. Further- more, advanced computer courses were designed and par- ticipants were asked to increase their knowledge in this ﬁeld by taking part in the classes. They were also asked to voice their suggestions for resolving the shortcomings of oﬃce tasks on a weekly basis. Holding specialized classes related to their jobs for increasing their knowledge was an- other method of intervention in this part. Ergonomic intervention: In the present study, an er- gonomic intervention group was selected to investigate the eﬀect of changes in oﬃce workstation by rearranging, replacing, and adding some equipment. Some of these er- gonomic interventions included replacing the keyboard, replacing or adding a mousepad, adjusting the worksta- tion, such as adjusting the height and angle of the monitor, relocating the telephone and ergonomic arrangement of equipment on the desk, distributing ergonomic footrests, an inclined plane for raising the surface of study to a Health Scope. 2019; 81:e68422. Safarian MH et al. Figure 1. Study ﬂow diagram showing the steps of the study higher level, distributing spine ﬁts ergonomic seat back support, replacing the chair and adjusting the light of the work station to prevent glare. The interventions were ad- ministered according to the ROSA method and whether all or a part of them were considered necessary for the work- station. At least one or more of the aforementioned in- terventions were administered at each workstation of this group. Step three: Evaluating the eﬀectiveness of interven- tions: In order to determine the eﬀectiveness of the interven- tions on oﬃce ergonomic risk factors of musculoskeletal discomforts, the evaluations were once again conducted ﬁrst through the ROSA and then by the CMDQ , four months after the last day of administrating the interventions. The results of the post-test were compared with the pretest. All evaluations were similarly conducted on the control group. For bias prevention, interventions were conducted simultaneously in four groups. 3.3. Data Analysis The SPSS version 16 was used for analyzing data in the present study. Normal distribution of data was done us- ing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or K-S P value 0.1 37. Also, according to central limit theorem, sample size of more than 30 can be considered as normally distributed thus in this study, parametric statistical test was used 38. In order to compare the mean demographic characteris- tics, such as age, height, weight, work experience and body mass index among the three groups and comparing the groups, the one-way ANOVA was used. homogeneity of vari- ances was checked using Levene’s statistic test P 0.05. For comparing the mean score for ROSA and the mean discomfort as quantitative variables before and after the intervention, the paired t-test was used. Also, for compar- ing ROSA scores before and after the intervention, one-way ANOVA was used. All tests were conducted at a 95% conﬁ- dence level. Health Scope. 2019; 81:e68422.

Results The demographic characteristics of the participants in each study group is presented in Table 1. The results of the statistical test showed that mean of variables, such as age, work experience and body mass index BMI did not have a signiﬁcant diﬀerence P 0.05. Comparative results of the mean score for the MSDs rate, ROSA and its components in workstations of employ- ees before and after the intervention are presented in Ta- ble 2. Results showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in total variables, except knee disorders P 0.01 in the pre-test. Equality of variances assumption was tested using Levene’s test P = 0.06 before interventions. However, in the post test, mouse and keyboard P 0.01, ROSA scores P 0.01, and knees P 0.05 were signiﬁcant. Also, the diﬀerence of the mean of the mouse and key- board P 0.01, total ROSA score P 0.0 and moni- tor and phone were signiﬁcant P 0.05. There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in mouse and keyboard and ROSA scores betweeen organizational and ergonomics groups P 0.001. In the mouse and keyboard, only ergonomics intervention was meaningful compared to the control group. Furthermore, in the ergonomic and education groups, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ROSA scores P 0.001 in the neck, shoulders, and hand/wrist P 0.05. The mean diﬀerences of MSDs neck P 0.01, shoul- ders P 0.01, and hand/wrist P 0.01 were signiﬁcant. In the neck areas, betweeen organizational and ergonomics groups, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences P 0.001. Also, in the shoulders area, betweeen organizational and er- gonomics groups, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences P = 0.01. Also, the results before the intervention showed that the highest score in the control group, obtained from the Cornell questionnaire, belonged to upper back 31.09, shoulders 23.37, and neck 19.26; in the educational inter- vention group, the highest score belonged to upper back 28.2, neck 25.3, and shoulders 24.1. In the organiza- tional intervention group, the highest score belonged to upper back 29.6, neck 24.73, and shoulders 21.18 and in the ergonomics intervention group, the highest score be- longed to upper back 27.82, neck 27.08, and shoulders 25.54. 5. Discussion This study aimed at investigating risk factors of MSDs and comparing interventions of the ergonomic, organi- zation, and education among staﬀ of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Results indicated that after inter- ventions, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was revealed in the ﬁ- nal mean score of ROSA in the ergonomic and education groups. However, the ﬁnal mean score of the groups after the intervention showed a considerable decline. In MSDs, the amount of these discomforts had signiﬁ- cant diﬀerences in three body parts neck, shoulders, and hand/wrist among the 11 areas under study in four groups. In other parts of the body, an amount of decline was ob- served, yet was not statistically signiﬁcant. The results showed eﬀect of ergonomic and education interventions for the neck, shoulders, and hand/wrist were signiﬁcant. The evaluation of ergonomics risk factors before the intervention showed that the mean score for ROSA at the workstations was four to ﬁve, which is an average risk. Furthermore, average risk was found in the Farrokhi et al. study 39. This is while the mean score of ROSA in the control group did not show any signiﬁcant intervention. These re- sults indicate the eﬀectiveness of all interventions, exclud- ing organization group in reducing ergonomic risk factors at the workstations. The eﬀect of ergonomic intervention was better than others. Lack of knowledge about ergonomics among employ- ees and the use of non-ergonomic equipment and lack of attention to ergonomic issues in the workplace may be the main reason for the high risk score for ergonomic workstations before the intervention. It is clear that rais- ing the employees’ knowledge about the standard condi- tion of the workstation and adjusting the workstation by themselves as well as creating physical changes in worksta- tions and replacing some non-ergonomic equipment can reduce the risk level and amount of musculoskeletal dis- comforts in certain areas of the body 40. These results are consistent with studies that had used educational and ergonomic interventions to reduce risk factors that cause MSDs. In Robertson et al. 19 study, it was found that the use of educational intervention and adjustable ergonomic chairs will favorably improve the condition of worksta- tions. Jahangiri et al. 41 also noted that using combined ergonomics and educational interventions is a more ap- propriate approach compared to the use of educational in- tervention alone in order to reduce MSDs. Nasiri et al. 35 in a study aimed at evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of er- gonomic interventions among oﬃce workers showed that using ergonomics and educational intervention could re- duce ergonomic risk factors and the prevalence of MSDs in some areas of the body. The results of the present study were inconsistent with studies conducted by Amick et al. 43, in which they did not 42 and Ali Arabian et al. Health Scope. 2019; 81:e68422. Safarian MH et al.

The ergonomic intervention aimed at changing the work environment was more eﬀec- tive than the educational intervention. Education alone will not change the work station. Other objectives of the present study included the eval- uation of organizational intervention based on job en- richment, rotation, and enlargement on ergonomic risk Health Scope. 2019; 81:e68422. Safarian MH et al. factors and the prevalence of these discomforts. Results showed that the use of these methods for reducing risk factors and the prevalence of discomforts in oﬃce works is not very eﬀective. The most important reason for this result is the ineﬀectiveness of interventions in the physi- cal conditions of the workstation 44. Given the fact that in oﬃce tasks, the type of work and duties of employees are almost similar, use of the aforementioned methods alone and in a short span of time 4 months cannot make changes in working postures and the amount of pressure on diﬀerent areas of the body. As a result, the use of this ap- proach on its own may not have an eﬀect on ergonomics risk factors and the reduction of these discomforts. In re- cent studies, the eﬀect of job design on increasing job sat- isfaction and mental power among oﬃce workers was well- evaluated 21-24; however, the eﬀect of these factors on of- ﬁce ergonomics risk factors is not clear. Choobineh et al. 45 showed in their study that ergonomic interventions, including education and changes in workstations, only af- fect physical factors and cannot properly reduce psychoso- cial factors of work. Thus, given the fact that job improve- ment, enrichment and rotation approaches are a part of psychosocial factors of work, the ineﬀectiveness of these approaches alone on reducing the ergonomic risk factors in the ROSA method, which often considers physical fac- tors, can be justiﬁed. In the present study, diﬀerent intervention methods educational and ergonomic interventions, mostly re- lated to physical and biomechanical MSDs risk factors and organization interventions including job enrichment, ro- tation, and enlargement related to psychosocial MSDs fac- tors, were designed. These interventions were adminis- tered in separate groups and the eﬀectiveness of each was separately determined, which can be considered as one of the strengths of this study. Weaknesses include failure to investigate psychosocial factors and the eﬀect of inter- ventions on reduction of these factors, low sample size, as well as the evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of interven- tions in a short period of time. It is suggested that simi- lar studies should be conducted with a combined design of ergonomics, education, and organization interventions for reducing all oﬃce ergonomics risk factors physical, biomechanical, and psychosocial and monitoring the ad- ministration of these interventions in a longer period of time. 5.1. Conclusions The results of the present study showed the eﬀective- ness of educational and ergonomic interventions in reduc- ing ergonomic risk factors and the prevalence of discom- forts among computer users. However, it was revealed that using organizational interventions, such as job en- richment, improvement and rotation alone is not an ef- fective method for reducing ergonomics risk factors and the prevalence of discomforts. Simultaneous use of com- plex methods, such as ergonomic, educational and organi- zational interventions, among oﬃce workers may yield de- sirable results in reducing risk factors for musculoskeletal problems. It should be noted that this intervention must be on the supervision of ergonomics experts and also the type of job task must be considered.
