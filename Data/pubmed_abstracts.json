This study examined subtypes of individuals who use cannabis based on usage characteristics and correlates with other substance consumption and harms. Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey (N = 5,037). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed considering age of onset, use frequency , tobacco consumption, heavy episodic drinking (HED), alcohol use disorder (AUD) and substance use disorder. Logistic regression assessed class correlates, and further analysis compared socio-demographic, health and behavioral indicators. A 4-class model was optimal for 496 individuals. The 'Polydrug' class (26.2%) and the 'Former' class (5.9%) showed earlier onset and highest frequency of cannabis use, with strongest harm associations. 'Polydrug' class had higher odds of other drug use (OR=3.0), tobacco use (OR=2.5), HED (OR=1.8), and AUD (OR=1.5), compared to lighter-use groups. About 30% of those who use cannabis are at increased risk for negative outcomes, particularly those with early, frequent, and polydrug use patterns. Brazil's public health should prioritize targeted prevention on the risks associated with early and frequent cannabis, and polydrug use. Addressing this at-risk group is essential for harm reduction and a health-focused approach."

Current nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapies face limitations due to systemic side effects. Caffeic acid (CA), a natural polyphenol with anti-inflammatory properties, holds therapeutic potential but suffers from poor solubility and ocular irritation. This study aimed to develop mPEG-PCL-modified CA-loaded nanoparticles (NanoCA) as a non-invasive eye drop formulation to enhance CA's solubility, bioavailability, and efficacy in treating endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). NanoCA was synthesized via the thin-film hydration method, characterized for size, zeta potential, drug loading, and release profile. Cytotoxicity was assessed in human corneal epithelial and RAW264.7 cells. Ocular tolerance was tested via slit-lamp and histopathological examinations. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in an EIU rat model using clinical scoring, histopathology, and immunofluorescence. NanoCA formed uniform nanospheres (42.40 ± 0.22 nm, -0.97 mV) with high encapsulation efficiency (99.17%). It exhibited sustained release over 12 h and reduced cytotoxicity compared to free CA. In EIU rats, NanoCA significantly suppressed inflammation, downregulated CD68 expression, and preserved aqueous barrier integrity. Histopathology confirmed minimal inflammatory infiltrates in NanoCA-treated eyes. The formulation demonstrated excellent ocular biocompatibility without corneal damage. NanoCA eye drops offer a safe, non-invasive therapeutic strategy for EIU, combining enhanced anti-inflammatory efficacy with high ocular tolerance. This nanoformulation presents a promising alternative to conventional CA delivery methods."

Curcumin (CUR), with its established anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, is limited in clinical application due to poor bioavailability. This study developed oleanolic acid-coated CUR nanoparticles (OC NPs) to enhance the efficacy of CUR in GC prevention. OC NPs were characterized by a spherical shape, demonstrating remarkable improvements in solubility and stability, maintaining structural integrity within biological systems and exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. In vitro studies showed OC NPs reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in GES-1 cells. In vivo, OC NPs effectively prevented ethanol-induced GC in mice by lowering inflammatory cytokines, while increasing antioxidant levels. Histological analysis confirmed enhanced gastric mucosal protection and reduced fibrosis and apoptosis. OC NPs demonstrated prolonged retention in the stomach, offering a targeted drug delivery system. These findings suggested OC NPs as a promising low-toxicity alternative for preventing GC."

In the HIDIT-II study, 120 patients were treated for 96 weeks with PEG-IFNa (180 μg weekly) in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg once daily) or placebo. Hepatitis flares were defined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5-fold above baseline or nadir values. ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post-treatment until follow-up Week 24. There were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG-IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG-IFNa + TDF). The frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis experienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty-four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with HBsAg loss at follow-up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG-IFNa therapy may experience ALT flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature withdrawal from treatment. If ALT flares may be beneficial in single patients requires further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00932971, EudraCT 2008-005560-13."

Simultaneous transdermal delivery can overcome reasons of their poor oral bioavailability. This was achieved via menthol-based microemulsion (ME) which can undergo thermoresponsive phase transition. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed at room temperature and 32 °C using menthol (oily phase) and Tween 80 (surfactant) in absence and presence of ethanol or propylene glycol as cosurfactants. In absence of cosurfactant, phase behavior depended on temperature with part of liquid crystal (LC) zone changing to microemulsion at 32 °C. Cosurfactant abolished LC/gel zones irrespective to temperature. Microemulsion formulations were selected from the area undergoing LC/ME thermoresponsive transition. These were evaluated for viscosity, droplet size, drug release and skin permeation. Characterization confirmed nanosized droplet and viscosity measurement confirmed thermoresponsive behavior in absence of cosurfactant. MEs showed lower release compared to saturated aqueous solutions. MEs resulted in significant increase in transdermal flux of finasteride and silodosin compared to aqueous control with ethanol containing system producing the highest flux. Simultaneous loading of finasteride and silodosin in microemulsions modulated thermodynamic activity. However, their flux remained significantly higher than aqueous suspension. Thus, the study introduced thermoresponsive microemulsion as efficient system for simultaneous delivery of finasteride and silodosin."

Employing a synthetic microbiome, we developed a dual-strain fermentation system to evaluate the impact of these fungi on Huangjiu's organoleptic properties. Introduction of these fungi significantly altered the flavor profile, enhancing 23 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with S. fibuligera notably increasing nine distinct VOCs. While molds contributed to bitterness by increasing bitter amino acids, S. fibuligera effectively mitigated these components, enhancing the beverage's alcohol body, smoothness, and balance. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing Huangjiu fermentation to improve its quality and appeal."

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide, and numerous studies have indicated that exposure to addictive substances, such as opioids, cocaine, etc., can result in decreased function of the OXT system. The study also found that OXT can reduce addictive behavior for certain drugs, including methamphetamine, alcohol, and cocaine, suggesting a close relationship between the OXT system and drug abuse. Although nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco, its interaction with the OXT system is unknown and requires further study. Therefore, OXT levels in plasma and brain regions associated with addiction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using chronic nicotine administration via a slow-release pump. In addition, the effects of OXT injection on nicotine self-administration behavior, motor activity, and intestinal microbiota in rats were examined by nicotine self-administration experiment, open field experiment, and 16S sequencing experiment. By depleting gut microbiota with oral antibiotics, this study aims to investigate whether gut microbiota mediates oxytocin effect on the nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. This study shows that chronic nicotine administration can reduce OXT levels in plasma and brain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and caudate putamen (CPU). OXT at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of nicotine infusions and the abundance of Lactobacillus in rats. Notably, our findings indicate that other mechanisms besides gut microbes are involved in the effect of peripheral OXT administration on the inhibition of nicotine self-administration."

Morin hydrate (M) was loaded into chitosan-poloxamer (CP) hydrogel and the resulting particles were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis spectrophotometer and scanning electron microscopy. Biological assays evaluated the metabolic activity, cell morphology and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of human bone marrow stem cells (HBMSC) in three different settings, such as the exposure to dissolved morin, hydrogel's leachates and assembled particles by indirect contact. Cells cultured in standard culture conditions were used as control. The effect of CP and MCP particles on the formation of collagenous and mineralized tissues was also assessed within the organotypic model of segmented embryonic chick femora. Datasets were assessed for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05). Morin at 50 μg/mL was cytocompatible and increased ALP activity. CP and MCP particles showed stability, and morin was entrapped in the hydrogel matrix without changing its chemical structure. Cultures treated with 30-min CP and MCP hydrogel leachates presented significantly higher metabolic activity compared to control. By indirect contact, CP particles increased metabolic activity, but only MCP particles induced an upregulation of ALP activity in comparison to control. The amount of collagenous tissue and mineralized area on the fractured embryonic chick femora was greater in MCP particles compared to CP counterparts. Chitosan-poloxamer platforms are suitable systems to delivery morin, enhancing cell proliferation and bone mineralization, which upholds its application as intracanal medication for endodontic purposes."

This work presents an overview about the use of several nanoformulations based on polymeric, protein, lipidic, or hybrid structure as suitable and stable drug delivery systems for encapsulating edaravone. We also evaluated the functionalization of nanoparticles with pegylated chains using the polyethylene glycol or tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate and the possibility of preparing polymeric nanoparticles at different pH (7.4, 9, and 11). Edaravone was sucessfully encapsulated in polymeric, lipid-polymer hybrid, and lipidic nanoparticles. The use of higher pH values in the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles has led to a decrease in nanoparticle size and an increase in the percentage of encapsulation efficiency. However, the resulting nanoformulations are not stable. Only polymeric and hybrid nanoparticles showed good stability over 80 days of storage, mainly at 4 °C. Overall, the nanoformulations tested did not show cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line except the nanostructured lipid carrier formulations that showed some cytotoxicity possibly due to lipidic peroxidation. In conclusion, this work shows that edaravone can be encapsulated in different nanocarriers that could act as an interesting alternative for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis."

In the HIDIT-II study, 120 patients were treated for 96 weeks with PEG-IFNa (180 μg weekly) in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg once daily) or placebo. Hepatitis flares were defined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5-fold above baseline or nadir values. ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post-treatment until follow-up Week 24. There were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG-IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG-IFNa + TDF). The frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis experienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty-four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with HBsAg loss at follow-up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG-IFNa therapy may experience ALT flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature withdrawal from treatment. If ALT flares may be beneficial in single patients requires further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00932971, EudraCT 2008-005560-13."

This study utilized a culture-dependent approach and amplicon sequencing to explore fungal community succession during Huangjiu fermentation. Key fungi identified include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus species (flavus, oryzae, niger), Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Thermomyces lanuginosus, Rhizopus arrhizus, Issatchenkia orientalis, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, and Diutina rugosa. Employing a synthetic microbiome, we developed a dual-strain fermentation system to evaluate the impact of these fungi on Huangjiu's organoleptic properties. Introduction of these fungi significantly altered the flavor profile, enhancing 23 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with S. fibuligera notably increasing nine distinct VOCs. While molds contributed to bitterness by increasing bitter amino acids, S. fibuligera effectively mitigated these components, enhancing the beverage's alcohol body, smoothness, and balance. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing Huangjiu fermentation to improve its quality and appeal."

The injection-equipment-sharing network likely plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of HCV transmission. Recognizing the emerging HCV epidemic in rural communities, we developed an agent-based network simulation model of HCV transmission via injection-equipment-sharing and used data on rural PWID networks to inform model parameterization and calibration. We then simulated an array of networks that varied key network properties to understand their impact on the magnitude and distribution of HCV incidence. The results show substantial heterogeneity in HCV acquisition risks across the network, summarized using the Ghyaini coefficient. In addition, although PWID with fewer injection partners had lower incidence, they collectively acquired more infections due to their larger population size. Higher prevalence, average number of partners, and homophily in HCV infection were associated with lower heterogeneity in infection risk across the network and higher overall incidence; other network properties including population size did not have a substantial impact. Our findings illustrate the heterogeneity of HCV transmission among PWID and suggest key network properties that could be measured, evaluated, or considered in the design of interventions for PWID in future studies."

Novel scaffolds for host cells, capable of potentially supporting these intricate interactions, are necessary to improve our current systems for mimicking host-microbiota interplay in vitro/ex vivo. In this research paper, we study the application of gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA) as scaffold material for intestinal epithelial cells in terms of permeability, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. We investigated whether the degree of substitution (DS) of GelMA influences the permeability and found that both high and low DS GelMA show sufficient permeability of biorelevant transport markers. Additionally, we researched epithelial cell adherence and viability, as well as mechanical characteristics of different concentrations of GelMA. All concentrations of hydrogel show long-term biocompatibility for the mono- and co-cultures, despite the goblet-like cells (LS174T) showing lower performance than enterocyte-like cells (Caco-2). The mechanical strength of all hydrogel concentrations was in a physiologically relevant range to be used as scaffold material for intestinal cells. Lastly, we examined the effect of the two sterilization methods, ethylene oxide (EO) and 70% ethanol followed by UVC (EtOH/UVC). We found that the impact of the two methods on the mechanical characteristics was minimal, and we did not find a significant effect between the two methods on cell viability and confluency of Caco-2 cells seeded on the GelMA hydrogels. Based on these results, we conclude that GelMA is a suitable material as a scaffold for intestinal cell types in terms of permeability, mechanical strength and biocompatibility. These findings contribute to the growing field of in vitro modeling of the gut and moves the field further to ensuring more translatable research on host-microbe interactions."

It is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and the most common non-communicable condition af-fecting millions worldwide and is a major public health challenge. The etiology of hypertension involves a complex interplay of environmental and pathophysiolog-ical factors alongside genetics, diet, lifestyle, and other coexisting medical conditions. Treatment typically involves medication and lifestyle adjustments such as dietary changes, regular exercise, weight management, and stress reduction to pharmacological interventions involving drugs like diuretics, beta-blockers & ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure. The pathogenesis of hyperten-sion is linked to endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodelling, sympathetic nervous system acti-vation, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Diagnosis is made by measuring blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer, with stages including prehypertension, stage 1 hyper-tension, and stage 2 hypertension. Effective management of hypertension requires lifestyle modi-fications such as dietary changes, regular exercise, weight control, and reduced alcohol consump-tion, alongside pharmacological interventions. As hypertension continues to be a leading cause of death and disability globally, understanding and addressing these factors are crucial for mitigating the widespread impact of hypertension on public health."

The study aimed to elucidate the relationship between gambling attitudes, gambling behaviour, and problem gambling, using responses to the 2018 Northern Territory Gambling Prevalence and Wellbeing Survey. Data from 1629 participants (Mage = 49.87 years; SD = 14.58 years; 51.63% female) who completed the Attitudes Towards Gambling Survey (ATGS), Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and reported their gambling frequency were analysed. Prior to testing for moderation of the attitude-frequency path by PGSI risk category, the measurement model of the ATGS was assessed for invariance and one item was removed to improve its psychometric properties. Problem gambling severity moderated the relationship between attitudes towards gambling and gambling frequency. The relationship between attitudes towards gambling and gambling behaviour strengthened at higher levels of problem gambling. Results indicate that the higher the risk of problem gambling, the stronger the influence of gambling attitudes on gambling frequency. These findings are discussed in relation to cognitive dissonance, rationalisation, gambling motivation, and the potential implications for problem gambling prevention strategies."

Approximately 4.5% of women of reproductive age have diabetes, with non-Hispanic Black women having the highest prevalence of 15%. Research on the impact of paternal diabetes on offspring cardiac anomalies is limited, but it may interact with metabolic syndrome to increase long-term health risks. Infants of diabetic parents are more likely to develop cyanotic and acyanotic heart defects, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and subsequently other cardiovascular issues. Fetal hyperinsulinemia, caused by maternal hyperglycemia, contributes to these conditions through oxidative stress, impaired heart development, and cardiac remodeling. Long-term risks include diabetes, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and early-onset cardiovascular disease. Treatment options are limited, often requiring surgery for severe conditions. Prevention focuses on tight glycemic control, a balanced diet, avoiding teratogens (nicotine, alcohol, or drugs), and using technology like continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, along with pregnancy screening and monitoring protocols. Understanding the effects of parental diabetes on offspring's cardiac health is crucial for early intervention, prevention, and improved maternal-fetal care, ultimately reducing the burden of congenital heart defects and long-term cardiovascular complications."

It ranges from well-defined patchy to diffuse total hair loss, impacting all hair-bearing areas of the body. AA most commonly predominantly manifests on the scalp. The pathophysiology of AA is complex and multi-faceted. The findings of our review article were consistent with the recent literature, delineating autoimmunity, genetic susceptibility, and environmental aspects to be the contributing factors. One of the main causes of AA is believed to be the disruption in the immune privilege of the hair follicles. Multiple genetic loci involved in hair follicle maturation and immune process have been linked to the development of AA as evidenced by several studies. It has been postulated that psychological stressors, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, gut microbiota, and drugs play a role in the pathogenesis of AA by exacerbating the immune response against the hair follicles. AA is a clinically diagnosed disorder. Topical, intra-lesional, and oral corticosteroids, topical and oral minoxidil, cyclosporine, and other immune therapy drugs are widely accepted first-line treatment options, although incomplete remission and relapses are common. Recently JAK-2 inhibitors and mesenchymal stem cell exosomes have shown promising results, potentially treating severe and refractory hair loss. AA has a bidirectional relationship with psychological symptoms as it can lead to social anxiety and depression, which in turn can aggravate hair loss. Hence, it is crucial to implement a holistic approach to managing AA including topical and systemic therapies, psychological counseling, and lifestyle modifications. It is imperative to fully declinate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease and formulate therapies in future research to help clinicians and dermatologists devise definitive guidelines to treat the condition for long-term remission."

The results demonstrated a significant increase in nonanal content from 2.23 ± 0.06 μg/kg to 8.14 ± 1.26 μg/kg after steaming. The formation pathways of two key flavor compounds, nonanal and 1-octen-3-ol, were attributed to fatty acid degradation. Hierarchical clustering and volcano plot showed metabolic shifts between raw and steamed krill, with differential metabolites like hydroquinone and gamma-aminobutyric acid emerging as key contributors to flavor changes. Furthermore, metabolic network further linked these shifts to reactions involving amino acids, nucleotide and other compounds during steaming, impacting the overall taste."

        "abstract": "Although previous studies have established the robust concurrent use of alcohol and gambling (i.e., using alcohol and gambling within a similar time period, but not together), there is a scarcity of empirical research focusing on the simultaneous use of alcohol while gambling (i.e., using alcohol while gambling). The wider substance use literature posits that the simultaneous use of substances is associated with increased severity of harm over concurrent use as well as greater social and behavioural consequences (Cummings et al., Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 51:351-359, 2019). The present study examined the psychological impact, mental health variables, and motives of simultaneously using alcohol on gambling behaviours in a sample of Canadian adults (N = 390). Participants who used alcohol while gambling were significantly more likely to endorse various facets of impulsivity, but specifically lack of premeditation. They were also more likely to gamble for enhancement and social reasons, and more likely to endorse greater alcohol use severity compared to those who did not. Interestingly, financial motives were a negative predictor, suggesting that people who gamble for financial reasons are less likely to engage in simultaneous alcohol use. The top reported reasons for using alcohol while gambling were to elicit positive emotions, to relax, and due to social circumstances. These findings corroborate previous work investigating simultaneous substance use and have potential implications for both policy and harm minimization by providing insight into the motivations for simultaneous gambling and alcohol use, and the greater harms resulting from simultaneous use."

Around 7 in 10 adults with RMD live overweight or with obesity. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing RMDs. It worsens disease activity, pain, and fatigue; impairs treatment responses; and thereby reduces quality of life and physical function. Further, obesity can amplify or drive several comorbidities that are more prevalent in RMDs including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Moreover, reciprocal risk arises since RMDs make it harder to be physically active and maintain a healthy weight, especially in the context of an obesogenic environment. In this viewpoint, we review relevant evidence to suggest obesity confers distinctive, important challenges in care and daily living for many patients with RMDs. With the advent of several highly effective drugs for obesity, we also highlight research needs including that for robust clinical trials to test the efficacy and effectiveness of these therapies as part of the management of inflammatory RMDs, as primary agent or adjuvant to immune targeted therapeutics. Implementing such weight management strategies should provide a much-needed holistic approach to the care of our patients."

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairment poses significant challenges for aging populations. Systemic inflammation, a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been implicated in neurodegeneration through mechanisms including blood-brain barrier disruption, microglial activation, and cytokine-mediated neuronal damage. This review examines the potential impact of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on cognitive function in RA, focusing on the inflammatory pathways linking systemic inflammation to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. DMARDs, categorized into conventional synthetic (csDMARDs), biologic (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic (tsDMARDs) classes, modulate immune responses through distinct mechanisms. Evidence suggests that DMARDs, particularly bDMARDs targeting proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, may mitigate neuroinflammatory processes and preserve cognitive function. However, the cognitive impact of csDMARDs such as methotrexate is complex, with conflicting reports regarding its role in vascular dementia. Emerging therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK-i) offer promise in modulating central inflammation, though clinical evidence remains limited. While some studies highlight protective effects of DMARDs against dementia, findings are inconsistent, hindered by heterogeneity in study design, patient demographics, and cognitive assessment methods. This review underscores the need for personalized treatment strategies, integrating RA management with cognitive health considerations. Future research should prioritize robust, prospective studies with long-term follow-up, incorporating neuroimaging and biomarker analysis to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning DMARD-associated cognitive outcomes. A better understanding of the involved inflammatory pathways in RA and the potential effects of DMARDs could lead to improved therapeutic approaches, enhancing quality of life for patients with RA and potentially benefiting broader strategies in preventing or treating dementia."

Acromegaly is characterized by short and long-term respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, with possible impact on mortality. In the last two decades, life expectancy has progressively increased in part due to a reduction in biochemically active disease, multidisciplinary treatment approaches and a reduction in complications, and the availability of new drugs. Of note, a leading cause of mortality, cardiovascular comorbidity, has been replaced by cancer(s). As such, neoplasms more frequently observed (colon, thyroid, breast, prostate, and stomach) in patients with acromegaly are receiving increased attention. Chronic exposure to increased growth hormone serum levels may contribute to an increase in the occurrence and progression of cancers. Various efforts have been made to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. However, there are no clear medical-related societal agreement(s) in relation to screening methods or timing regarding neoplasm(s) diagnosis in patients with acromegaly.

Hepatitis flares were defined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5-fold above baseline or nadir values. ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post-treatment until follow-up Week 24. There were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG-IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG-IFNa + TDF). The frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis experienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty-four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with HBsAg loss at follow-up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG-IFNa therapy may experience ALT flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature withdrawal from treatment.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of different environmental factors on the biosynthesis and accumulation of medicinal components and identify biomarker genes and functional proteins associated with abiotic stress responses of Isatis indigotica Fort. We proposed evaluating the quality of Isatidis Folium based on multi-component quantitative analysis and integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological indicators to elucidate the mechanisms of herbal quality variation. The results revealed that abiotic stress conditions significantly altered the levels of bioactive constituents, physiological indices, and specific genes and proteins. Notably, biological pathways such as porphyrin metabolism, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation by photosynthetic organisms were implicated in phototoxicity within the photosystem under abiotic stresses. Biological pathways related to indole metabolism, specifically phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan synthesis, tryptophan metabolism, and indole alkaloid synthesis, were recognized as critical regulatory networks modulating indole alkaloid content. Candidate biomarkers such as HemB, PsbB, RBS2, RIBA2, TRPA, and TRPB were identified as potential factors of quality deterioration under adverse conditions. Based on the integration of chemical analysis and multi-omics techniques, a new hierarchical quality control scenario for Isatidis Folium was finally proposed, providing a research foundation for the innovation-driven development of traditional Chinese medicine."

Also linked to PD include human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). PD also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it triggers inflammatory reactions throughout the body. CVD and chronic PD were linked to significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood lipids. Furthermore, elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels may influence PD-related inflammation and periodontium degradation. In addition, there was a correlation between a reduction in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and a reduction in circulating oxidative stress (OS); this was shown to be achieved by improved dental hygiene and non-surgical periodontal treatment. Consequently, this research set out to examine the connections between lipid metabolism and PD, as well as the effects of PD on the efficacy of statins and other medications that decrease cholesterol, as well as inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs may affect gum and tooth health. We found that higher blood levels of bad cholesterol exacerbate PD. Furthermore, PD makes CVD worse. The involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in bacterial infections and the development of PD is inversely proportional to the increase in LDL levels. The treatment of this disease could, therefore, benefit greatly by inhibiting this chemical. Medications that lower cholesterol levels may potentially help treat this problem. The possible side effects of this medication on PD patients need more investigation. We have reviewed the literature on PD and its relationship to lipid metabolism, LDL receptors, and lipid rafts. Afterward, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism in the local viral infection that causes PD. Lastly, we examined how statins and other lipid-lowering medications impact PD."

        "abstract": "During the 2022 monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak in non-endemic countries, sexual transmission was identified as the dominant mode of transmission, and particularly affected the community of men who have sex with men (MSM). This community experienced the highest incidence of Mpox cases, exacerbating the public health burden they already face due to the disproportionate impact of HIV. Given the simultaneous spread of HIV and Mpox within the MSM community, it is crucial to understand how these diseases interact. Specifically, since HIV is endemic within this population, understanding its influence on the spread and control of Mpox is essential. In this study, we analyze a mechanistic mathematical model of Mpox to explore the potential impact of HIV on the dynamics of Mpox within the MSM community. The model considered in this work incorporates the transmission dynamics of the two diseases, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV. We assumed that HIV was already endemic in the population at the onset of the Mpox outbreak. Through our analysis, we derived the Mpox invasion reproduction number within an HIV-endemic setting and established the existence and local asymptotic stability of the Mpox-free equilibrium under these conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the existence and local asymptotic stability of an Mpox-endemic equilibrium in an HIV-endemic regime. Notably, our findings revealed that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation, a phenomenon that may not have occurred in the absence of HIV within the population. The public health significance of our results is that the presence of HIV in the MSM community could hinder efforts to control Mpox, allowing the disease to become endemic even when its invasion reproduction number is below one. Additionally, we found that Mpox might be more challenging to control in scenarios where HIV increases susceptibility to Mpox. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our analysis confirms that reducing sexual contact can be effective for controlling the spread of Mpox within the MSM community."

We characterized the metabolomic signatures of the adgrl3.1 mutant zebrafish ADHD model and examined the impact of methylphenidate, guanfacine, atomoxetine, and 5 novel putative therapeutics identified in a prior screen, including amlodipine. Our analysis revealed that the drugs commonly affect pathways related to amino acid and lipid metabolism, specifically involving glycine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. This convergence on similar metabolic targets was unexpected and suggests a broader, systemic effect of ADHD therapeutics, challenging the traditional view of distinct drug mechanisms. Amlodipine exhibited metabolic effects consistent with established treatments, indicating its potential as a viable alternative or adjunct therapy. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic underpinnings of ADHD and highlight potential targets for developing improved therapeutic strategies.

We conducted an interview-administered household survey in urban, semi-urban and rural regions in Enugu State in 2020. We collected data on the use of malaria services and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using household assets ownership. The benefits of malaria services were calculated by multiplying the unit cost of services while the net benefit was calculated by subtracting OOP payment from the benefits. A concentration index was used to assess equity in spending on malaria across socioeconomic quintiles. We estimated the gross and net benefit incidences for malaria services by deducting the OOP payment from the gross benefits. Most respondents were women, married, and had attained secondary education. Over 53.9% of surveyed households owned bed net. About 31.6% of households used malaria drugs in the past months. All users paid OOP for malaria drugs, sprays and lab services and over one-third of households incurred OOP costs for bed nets. The total OOP expenditure for malaria in the past month was $0.53 per household. The gross benefit incidence for malaria services was $1836.7. The net benefit and donor benefit were $1679.5 and $705.4, respectively. Both gross and net benefit for malaria services favored less-poor households. Households in Enugu State incur OOP expenses for malaria diagnosis and treatment, and less-poor households benefit more from government- and donor- subsidized malaria services, including bed nets. It is imperative to improve the accessibility and affordability of malaria diagnosis and treatment in Nigeria to ensure equitable access to malaria services."

Even after advancement and development in medical science, it is a big task to achieve victory over type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM can be a reason for fatal events like stroke, cardiac failure, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Many advanced antidiabetic drugs have been introduced in the market in the past two decades, leading researchers to hunt for new target proteins and their potential modulators that can help develop newer antidiabetic drugs. This review article comprises a broad literature of the latest developments in the management of T2DM concerning new target proteins, their inhibitors, or drugs from the clinical arena employed for the successful management of symptoms of T2DM using mono, dual, or triple combination medication therapy. The review categorizes antidiabetic drugs into three general classes that include conventional drug targets, currently explored targets, and upcoming emerging targets. The review aims to merge information on the medicines affecting these targets, their mechanisms, followed by the chemical structures, and recent advancements."

        "abstract": "Cancer and kidney diseases (KD) intersect in many ways resulting in worse outcomes. Both conditions are correlated with cognitive impairment, which can be exacerbated in cancer patients by known effects of many antineoplastic drugs on cognition, leading to a phenomenon known as chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). This manifests as poor attention span, disturbed short-term memory, and general mental sluggishness. This literature review explores CRCI and investigates the potential impact of KD on this phenomenon. Additionally, we highlight the shared pathogenetic mechanisms (including neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, vascular disease, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalances), clinical presentation and imaging findings between cognitive impairment in KD and CRCI. The disruption of the blood-brain barrier might be a key mechanism for increased brain permeability to anticancer drugs in nephropathic patients with cancer. Based on existing knowledge, we found a potential for heightened neurotoxicity of antineoplastic drugs and a synergistic potentiation of cognitive impairment in cancer patients with KD. However, further translational research is urgently required to validate this hypothesis."

However, progress in developing drugs targeting MPXV has been slow. Here, we investigate the natural alkaloid narciclasine as a potential inhibitor of poxviruses. Our investigation demonstrates that narciclasine at 40 nmol/L (nM) to 160 nM dosages effectively blocks vaccinia virus (VACV), a representative poxvirus. Specifically, narciclasine disrupts the production of extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), which is crucial for viral spread. Narciclasine's antiviral impact is probably attributed to its activation of the RhoA signaling pathway. This study highlights narciclasine's potential as a promising new therapeutic candidate against poxviruses, offering prospects for its development into a potent antiviral agent that is essential for combating emerging poxvirus outbreaks."

In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional examination of PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy, with a specific focus on HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) on INSTI-based regimens (n = 61) and efavirenz (EFV)-based regimens (n = 28). Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluations and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, including T1-weighted images and resting-state functional MRI. Compared to the EFV group, the INSTI group exhibited primarily reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the right superior parietal gyrus, higher regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the left postcentral gyrus, lower ReHo in the right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and increased voxel-wise functional connectivity for the seed region in the left inferior temporal gyrus with clusters in the right cuneus. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a main effect of antiretroviral drugs on GMV changes, but no main effect of neuropsychiatric disorders or their interaction. The repeated analysis of participants who did not switch regimens confirmed the GMV changes in the INSTI group, validating the initial findings. Our study demonstrated gray matter atrophy and functional brain changes in PLWH on INSTI-based regimens compared to those on EFV-based regimens. These neuroimaging results provide valuable insights into the characteristics of brain network modifications in PLWH receiving INSTI-based regimens."

        "abstract": "Background: Substance use is highly prevalent among older people with HIV and continues to have a negative impact on engagement along the HIV care continuum, particularly among African Americans (AA). Social factors like resource insecurity, stigma, and discrimination may play a role in substance use behaviors. However, there is limited research on how these social factors impact substance use among older people with HIV. Objectives: The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine associations between demographic and social factors and substance use among older AAs with HIV. Results: Fifty-two participants who were ≥50 years of age, living in Ohio, and identified as Black or AA completed an online survey. Past three-month substance use was self-reported for alcohol, opioids, cocaine, cannabis, and/or amphetamine type stimulants. Separate unadjusted, logistic regression models were conducted to examine factors between each type of substance and HIV-related stigma, food and housing insecurity, discrimination, history of incarceration, employment status, and demographics. The majority of participants self-reported past three-month use of cocaine (53.8%), cannabis (67.3%), amphetamine type stimulants (51.9%), and risky alcohol use (85.0%), and half reported opioid use. HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and housing insecurity were all associated with increased odds of opioid, cocaine, and amphetamine use. Discrimination, food, and housing insecurity were associated with increased odds of cannabis use and risky alcohol use. Conclusions: More research is needed to further understand how social factors impact substance use among older people with HIV. This understanding can lead to interventions that target these social factors which in turn reduces substance use."

Hepatitis flares were defined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5-fold above baseline or nadir values. ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post-treatment until follow-up Week 24. There were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG-IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG-IFNa + TDF). The frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis experienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty-four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with HBsAg loss at follow-up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG-IFNa therapy may experience ALT flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature withdrawal from treatment. If ALT flares may be beneficial in single patients requires further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00932971, EudraCT 2008-005560-13."

Simultaneously, concerns about the environmental impact of the food system have intensified, particularly considering projected population growth in the coming years. This work introduces a new graphical representation of the traditional Mediterranean dietary model, developed by a dedicated Working Group of the Italian Society of Human Nutrition (SINU). This new model emphasizes plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and extra-virgin olive oil, at its foundation, reflecting their historical and scientific significance in the Mediterranean diet. Animal products, particularly red and processed meats, are de-emphasized, with dairy, white meats, and eggs recommended for moderate, weekly consumption. The pyramid also advocates limiting added sugars, salt, and alcohol to address their links with chronic diseases. Sustainability principles are woven into the framework, prioritizing local, seasonal, and minimally processed foods while discouraging food waste. The pyramid aligns with global recommendations from FAO and WHO, offering a comprehensive guide to adopting a healthy, sustainable dietary lifestyle while preserving cultural traditions and addressing contemporary nutritional and environmental challenges."

Employing a synthetic microbiome, we developed a dual-strain fermentation system to evaluate the impact of these fungi on Huangjiu's organoleptic properties. Introduction of these fungi significantly altered the flavor profile, enhancing 23 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with S. fibuligera notably increasing nine distinct VOCs. While molds contributed to bitterness by increasing bitter amino acids, S. fibuligera effectively mitigated these components, enhancing the beverage's alcohol body, smoothness, and balance. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing Huangjiu fermentation to improve its quality and appeal."

Differences across groups in demographics, comorbid health conditions, health factors, and healthcare encounters were assessed. 45.7% of participants were abstainers, 38.5% were low risk, and 15.8% were at risk. Comparisons revealed abstainers to have higher frequencies of health conditions, as well as higher rates of emergency department and primary care utilization. At-risk patients had the highest rate of overall healthcare utilization and, when compared directly to low-risk patients, were more likely to be diagnosed with many physical and mental health conditions.

Since the spread of Varroa destructor, overwintering survival has significantly declined, making it one of the most serious threats to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations worldwide. Natural acaricides, such as oxalic acid (OA), are widely employed for managing Varroa mites; however, their pharmacodynamics, particularly their impacts on honey bee physiology and immunity, remain insufficiently understood. We studied effects of oxalic acid on honey bee workers. The study compared three treatments: flumethrin, OA-glycerine strips (OA-G), and OA trickling (OA-T). Twelve colonies were divided into four groups, with samples collected at five time points (0, 24, 48, 72, and 192 h). Physiological changes were assessed through markers of oxidative stress, longevity, and immune parameters. Exposure to oxalic acid via glycerine strips induced a humoral immune response in adult bees. The antimicrobial activity of hemolymph and levels of antimicrobial peptides (abaecin, apidaecin, defensin, and hymenoptaecin) were elevated between 48 and 192 h after OA-G treatment compared to the control group. In contrast, these parameters were not influenced by OA-T or flumethrin treatment. These findings suggest that OA-G strips activate the honey bee's immune system, providing insights into broader implications of OA use in beekeeping. It is crucial to determine whether the activation of humoral immune systems has positive or negative effects, as well as to develop standardized and reliable treatment protocols that ensure both - health of colonies and their effectiveness in controlling Varroa mite infestations."

Internal and external resources can also be accumulated by engaging in an activity an individual is passionate about, explained by the dualistic model of passion (DMP) as enhancing mental and spiritual well-being, health, and personal growth, thereby fostering positive emotions, community involvement, deeper relationships, and heightened performance across various life domains.

        "abstract": "Alcohol, in the form of ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is a widely consumed substance with significant implications for human health. Research studies indicate multifaceted effects of alcohol on the cardiovascular system with both protective and harmful effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), depending on the amount involved and the pattern of consumption. Among the critical components of the cardiovascular system are endothelial cells which line blood vessels. These cells are pivotal in maintaining vessel homeostasis, regulating blood flow, and preventing thrombosis. Their compromised function correlates with arterial disease progression and is predictive of cardiovascular events. Here we review research investigating how alcohol exposure affects the endothelium to gain insight into potential mechanisms mediating alcohol's influence on ASCVD underlying heart attacks and strokes. Studies highlight opposite effects of low versus high levels of alcohol on many endothelial functions. In general, low-to-moderate levels of alcohol (~5-25 mM) maintain the endothelium in a non-activated state supporting vascular homeostasis, while higher alcohol levels (≥50 mM) lead to endothelial dysfunction and promotes atherosclerosis. These biphasic endothelial effects of alcohol might underlie the varying impacts of different alcohol consumption patterns on ASCVD."

This study examined subtypes of individuals who use cannabis based on usage characteristics and correlates with other substance consumption and harms. Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey (N = 5,037). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed considering age of onset, use frequency , tobacco consumption, heavy episodic drinking (HED), alcohol use disorder (AUD) and substance use disorder. Logistic regression assessed class correlates, and further analysis compared socio-demographic, health and behavioral indicators. A 4-class model was optimal for 496 individuals. The 'Polydrug' class (26.2%) and the 'Former' class (5.9%) showed earlier onset and highest frequency of cannabis use, with strongest harm associations. 'Polydrug' class had higher odds of other drug use (OR=3.0), tobacco use (OR=2.5), HED (OR=1.8), and AUD (OR=1.5), compared to lighter-use groups. About 30% of those who use cannabis are at increased risk for negative outcomes, particularly those with early, frequent, and polydrug use patterns. Brazil's public health should prioritize targeted prevention on the risks associated with early and frequent cannabis, and polydrug use. Addressing this at-risk group is essential for harm reduction and a health-focused approach."

In the HIDIT-II study, 120 patients were treated for 96 weeks with PEG-IFNa (180 μg weekly) in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg once daily) or placebo. Hepatitis flares were defined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5-fold above baseline or nadir values. ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post-treatment until follow-up Week 24. There were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG-IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG-IFNa + TDF). The frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis experienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty-four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with HBsAg loss at follow-up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG-IFNa therapy may experience ALT flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature withdrawal from treatment. If ALT flares may be beneficial in single patients requires further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00932971, EudraCT 2008-005560-13."

Employing a synthetic microbiome, we developed a dual-strain fermentation system to evaluate the impact of these fungi on Huangjiu's organoleptic properties. Introduction of these fungi significantly altered the flavor profile, enhancing 23 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with S. fibuligera notably increasing nine distinct VOCs. While molds contributed to bitterness by increasing bitter amino acids, S. fibuligera effectively mitigated these components, enhancing the beverage's alcohol body, smoothness, and balance.

Morin hydrate (M) was loaded into chitosan-poloxamer (CP) hydrogel and the resulting particles were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis spectrophotometer and scanning electron microscopy. Biological assays evaluated the metabolic activity, cell morphology and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of human bone marrow stem cells (HBMSC) in three different settings, such as the exposure to dissolved morin, hydrogel's leachates and assembled particles by indirect contact. Cells cultured in standard culture conditions were used as control. The effect of CP and MCP particles on the formation of collagenous and mineralized tissues was also assessed within the organotypic model of segmented embryonic chick femora. Datasets were assessed for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05). Morin at 50 μg/mL was cytocompatible and increased ALP activity. CP and MCP particles showed stability, and morin was entrapped in the hydrogel matrix without changing its chemical structure. Cultures treated with 30-min CP and MCP hydrogel leachates presented significantly higher metabolic activity compared to control. By indirect contact, CP particles increased metabolic activity, but only MCP particles induced an upregulation of ALP activity in comparison to control. The amount of collagenous tissue and mineralized area on the fractured embryonic chick femora was greater in MCP particles compared to CP counterparts. Chitosan-poloxamer platforms are suitable systems to delivery morin, enhancing cell proliferation and bone mineralization, which upholds its application as intracanal medication for endodontic purposes."

This work presents an overview about the use of several nanoformulations based on polymeric, protein, lipidic, or hybrid structure as suitable and stable drug delivery systems for encapsulating edaravone. We also evaluated the functionalization of nanoparticles with pegylated chains using the polyethylene glycol or tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate and the possibility of preparing polymeric nanoparticles at different pH (7.4, 9, and 11). Edaravone was sucessfully encapsulated in polymeric, lipid-polymer hybrid, and lipidic nanoparticles. The use of higher pH values in the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles has led to a decrease in nanoparticle size and an increase in the percentage of encapsulation efficiency. However, the resulting nanoformulations are not stable. Only polymeric and hybrid nanoparticles showed good stability over 80 days of storage, mainly at 4 °C. Overall, the nanoformulations tested did not show cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line except the nanostructured lipid carrier formulations that showed some cytotoxicity possibly due to lipidic peroxidation. In conclusion, this work shows that edaravone can be encapsulated in different nanocarriers that could act as an interesting alternative for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis."

While recent research examines how these issues are addressed in drug education curriculum, little is known about the perspectives of professionals involved in education design and delivery. Research suggests that agency is centrally important for understanding experiences of harmful, pleasurable or ambiguous sexual encounters in consumption settings. I analyse understandings of the relationship between agency, drug consumption, sex and harm generated during in-depth interviews with drug education professionals. Informed by Karen Barad's relational concepts of agency and response-ability, I examine the agencies that these professionals constitute as the locus of harms related to consumption and sex. Some focus on individual human agency, while others position alcohol and drugs as the primary agents of harm. Throughout the analysis I argue that both approaches offer an impoverished account of drug consumption and sex and inform education approaches that struggle to respond to other significant agencies such as gender. I also examine accounts that grapple with agencies beyond people and drugs. Overall, I argue for drug education approaches that are more response-able to the multiple agencies that together constitute experiences of drug consumption and sex."

Though substance abuse among street children has been investigated and reported in Pakistan, few studies have explored the relationship between narcotic use and its associated factors. This study was conducted to determine factors associated with narcotic use among street children in Islamabad Capital Territory. An analytical cross-sectional survey of a probability-based sample of 443 (males) street children aged 12 to 18 years, was conducted in Islamabad in March 2022. Using self-reported measures, the relationship between narcotic use and associated factors was determined using multivariate regression analysis. Out of 443 street children, with a mean age of 16.3 ± 1.6 years, 244 (55%) were between 17 and 18 years old. 119 (26.9%) worked as garbage collectors and 76 (17.2%) worked as car washers. The most common substance used was cigarettes in 285 (64.3%), naswaar in 172 (38.8%), hashish in 144 (32.5%), and alcohol in 63 (14.2%) street children. There were 164 (37%) street children who admitted having used narcotics (hashish, heroin, and bhang). On multivariate analysis, age > 16 years (OR: 2.3), sleeping on the streets (OR: 2.4), higher monthly income > Rs.18,000 (OR: 1.6), use of drugs by friends (OR: 5), and involvement in the selling of drugs (OR: 10.3) were independently associated with narcotic use. Substance abuse is a concerning trend among street children in Islamabad. When certain high-risk factors are present, these children are prone to narcotic use."

The injection-equipment-sharing network likely plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of HCV transmission. Recognizing the emerging HCV epidemic in rural communities, we developed an agent-based network simulation model of HCV transmission via injection-equipment-sharing and used data on rural PWID networks to inform model parameterization and calibration. We then simulated an array of networks that varied key network properties to understand their impact on the magnitude and distribution of HCV incidence. The results show substantial heterogeneity in HCV acquisition risks across the network, summarized using the Ghyaini coefficient. In addition, although PWID with fewer injection partners had lower incidence, they collectively acquired more infections due to their larger population size. Higher prevalence, average number of partners, and homophily in HCV infection were associated with lower heterogeneity in infection risk across the network and higher overall incidence; other network properties including population size did not have a substantial impact. Our findings illustrate the heterogeneity of HCV transmission among PWID and suggest key network properties that could be measured, evaluated, or considered in the design of interventions for PWID in future studies."

In total, the blood samples from 76 free-ranging Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber L.) were used for the detection of antibodies to 12 infectious agents, including 3 parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Trichinella spp.), 5 bacteria (Brucella spp., Chlamydophila abortus, Coxiella burnetti, Francisella tularensis, Leptospira spp.), and 4 viruses (Aujeszky's Disease Virus ADV, Hepatitis E virus HEV, Tick-borne Encephalitis virus TBEV, and West Nile Fever virus WNV). The sera were examined by Agglutination test, or Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, depending on the tested pathogen. Out of 76 animals, the following seropositivity was obtained: T. gondii 18.4 % (14/76), N. caninum 7.9 % (6/76), Leptospira spp. 3.9 % (3/76), F. tularensis 2.6 % (2/76) and Hepatitis E virus 2.6 % (2/76), with statistically significant differences in the positivity of animals to different pathogens (p=0.0007).

The average incidence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections in ICUs is 41.7 cases/1,000 patients, highlighting the urgent need for more effective alternative therapies to replace carbapenems. Thus, this study aimed to investigate for the first time the antibacterial activity of curcumin in combination with the novel phage vB_AbaSI_1 to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in vitro. Phage vB_AbaSI_1 (capsid diameter 91 nm, contractile tail 94/20 nm) was isolated from sewage and infects ~ 29% of the 131 bacterial isolates examined. The 52,783 kb phage genome has 75 ORFs, encodes an integrase, lacks tRNAs/virulence genes, and belongs to the Caudoviricetes. Commercially sourced curcumin (400 µg/mL), combined with phage vB_AbaSI_1 (MOI 100) reduced MDR A. baumannii 131 to undetectable levels 1 h post-treatment at 37 °C, and this efficacy was further extended for 5 h in double-dosed phage/curcumin-treated cultures. In contrast, treatment with just phage vB_AbaSI_1 reduced bacterial growth but rebounded within 3 h, while curcumin-only treated cultures showed only 1-log bacterial reduction compared to untreated control. The phage/curcumin synergy occurred exclusively with phage-susceptible strains pre-curcumin exposure. This suggests the potential disruption of bacterial cell membrane during phage infection allowing curcumin entry, as no synergy was observed with phage-resistant strains. This innovative strategy of combining phage and curcumin showed great efficacy at controlling MDR A. baumannii and has a potential for therapeutic deployment. Future work will focus on engineering the phage to make it therapeutically acceptable."

The return of genetic data was not offered at baseline, but in 2023, we sent invitations to participants for consent to return of actionable genetic findings. We generated exome sequence data from 4,198 participants and used the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) v.3.2 list of 81 genes, ClinVar review, and pathogenicity status, plus manual curation, to develop a pipeline to identify potentially actionable variants. We identified 104 individuals (2.5%) with 108 actionable genotypes at 39 variants in 23 genes and validated these. Working with the NHS Clinical Genetics service, which provided genetic counseling and clinical verification of the research results, and after expert clinical review, we notified 64 consenting participants (or their next of kin) of their actionable genotypes. Ten actionable variants across seven genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATP7B, TTN, KCNH2, MUTYH, and GAA) have risen 50- to >3,000-fold in frequency through genetic drift in ancestral island localities. Viking Genes is one of the first UK research cohorts to return actionable findings, providing an ethical and logistical exemplar of return of results.

Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance."

People travel with their mouth firmly in their body, yet the mouth's wellbeing does not rate a mention. This article represents the first exploration of a range of topics relevant to an until now neglected, yet potentially highly important, area of health care. A range of dental mishaps can occur while away from home, from simple toothache to accidents, serious emergencies, or restoration failures. Other problems originate in unwise behaviour, including holiday-inspired body modifications.Unless there is pain, teeth are typically not thought about much. However, examining the practical side of dental hygiene during travels, several overlooked and perhaps surprising topics emerge that - through the travel lens - take on a different and important role: the oral microbiome, toothbrush hygiene, the toilet plume, and traveller diarrhoea. Based on this discussion, recommendations are made for clinical practice, education, and further research.The historical chasm between dentistry and medicine, despite long-standing calls for change, does not seem to go away and impairs holistic high quality travel health care. Travel medicine can bypass this unproductive division. It has the unique opportunity to be the first medical specialty cooperating closely with dentists to bridge this gap by providing quality travel health care to travellers with all their body parts attached."

The aim of the study was to examine the blood samples of free-ranging beavers to detect antibodies to 12 infectious agents. In total, the blood samples from 76 free-ranging Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber L.) were used for the detection of antibodies to 12 infectious agents, including 3 parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Trichinella spp.), 5 bacteria (Brucella spp., Chlamydophila abortus, Coxiella burnetti, Francisella tularensis, Leptospira spp.), and 4 viruses (Aujeszky's Disease Virus ADV, Hepatitis E virus HEV, Tick-borne Encephalitis virus TBEV, and West Nile Fever virus WNV). The sera were examined by Agglutination test, or Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, depending on the tested pathogen. Out of 76 animals, the following seropositivity was obtained: T. gondii 18.4 % (14/76), N. caninum 7.9 % (6/76), Leptospira spp. 3.9 % (3/76), F. tularensis 2.6 % (2/76) and Hepatitis E virus 2.6 % (2/76), with statistically significant differences in the positivity of animals to different pathogens (p=0.0007). Antibodies to the other 7 agents were not found. In total, 19 of 76 (25 %) animals had antibodies at least to one tested pathogen, with single infection in 12 animals (15.8 %) and mixed infection of 2-3 agents in 7 animals (9.2 %).

This study aims to isolate and characterize L. monocytogenes strains along the beef production chain of a vertically integrated industry. Sampling included carcass, hide, and environmental samples collected from a cattle unit and partner slaughterhouse. The samples were examined for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. The isolates were characterized via molecular serotyping and MALDI-TOF proteomic analysis. Further analyses included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, biofilm formation assessment, and virulence gene investigation. A total of 24 L. monocytogenes strains were isolated. The prevalence in carcasses, hide and slaughterhouse environment was 21.7%, 6.7% and 8.8% respectively. Molecular serogroup IIc predominated, followed by serogroups IIa, IIb, and IVb. Almost all strains showed a moderate or strong ability to produce biofilms and resistance to at least one antimicrobial, with clindamycin, vancomycin, and tetracycline demonstrating the highest rates of resistance. Three strains were also characterized as multidrug-resistant, while all strains possessed at least six virulence genes. The proteomic analysis organized the isolated strains in three clusters, whereas the transmission pathways primarily implicated carcass washing water and hides. Understanding L.monocytogenes dissemination along the beef production chain is vital for preventing transmission to humans and emergence of a listeriosis outbreak."

Sebaceous carcinoma often masquerades as benign diagnoses, such as blepharitis and chalazion, yet it is an aggressive cancer with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, a high level of suspicion is required to avoid vision loss and death by metastatic disease. There are currently no targeted therapies for advanced disease, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis.

Although some sources of variability have been listed so far, a mathematical description of the variability in bacterial population behavior has not yet been realized. The present paper illustrates stochastic bacterial population growth and/or inactivation behavior from a mathematical point of view. Among various stochastic factors, sampling for the quantification of bacterial numbers and single-cell division/inactivation responses to food environments are highlighted as sources of technical and biological variability. Furthermore, the variability in sampling and single-cell division/inactivation responses emerges as variability in both number and time from the viewpoint of population dynamics. The aforementioned mathematical description of variability enables combining Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions into traditional kinetic equations as its residual distribution. The primary focus is on the stochastic nature of variability, while it also includes discussions on incorporating parameter uncertainty into mathematical models. The traditional kinetic equation integrated with technical and biological variability and uncertainty enables a precise estimate of variation in population behavior, which would facilitate exposure assessment in quantitative microbial risk assessment."

Also linked to PD include human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). PD also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it triggers inflammatory reactions throughout the body. CVD and chronic PD were linked to significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood lipids. Furthermore, elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels may influence PD-related inflammation and periodontium degradation. In addition, there was a correlation between a reduction in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and a reduction in circulating oxidative stress (OS); this was shown to be achieved by improved dental hygiene and non-surgical periodontal treatment. Consequently, this research set out to examine the connections between lipid metabolism and PD, as well as the effects of PD on the efficacy of statins and other medications that decrease cholesterol, as well as inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs may affect gum and tooth health. We found that higher blood levels of bad cholesterol exacerbate PD. Furthermore, PD makes CVD worse. The involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in bacterial infections and the development of PD is inversely proportional to the increase in LDL levels. The treatment of this disease could, therefore, benefit greatly by inhibiting this chemical. Medications that lower cholesterol levels may potentially help treat this problem. The possible side effects of this medication on PD patients need more investigation. We have reviewed the literature on PD and its relationship to lipid metabolism, LDL receptors, and lipid rafts. Afterward, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism in the local viral infection that causes PD. Lastly, we examined how statins and other lipid-lowering medications impact PD."

Although P. multocida is primarily known to cause respiratory diseases in cattle, its role in reproductive disorders, particularly in epididymitis, has not been extensively studied. Histopathological examination showed pyogranulomatous lesions in the epididymal duct and surrounding areas, consisting of ductal extension, immune cell infiltration, epithelial degeneration, abscess formation, and fibrosis with angiogenesis. In the immunohistochemical analysis, positive reactions to anti-P. multocida serotype A antibodies were observed in macrophages and neutrophils in the epididymal ducts and surrounding areas, suggesting an ascending infection rather than hematogenous spread. This report is the first to directly confirm P. multocida involvement in bovine epididymitis through immunohistochemical examination. P. multocida was isolated in pure culture from the scrotal contents in all cases. The isolates were grouped into sequence types ST79 and ST13, commonly found in the respiratory tract and oral cavity of cattle, using the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation multilocus sequence typing scheme; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed unique band patterns in the isolates from each case. These results suggest that multiple genetically distinct strains, commonly found in the nasal and oral cavities, incidentally infected the epididymis via an ascending route. This bacterium warrants further investigation as a potential cause of reproductive disorders, particularly in Japanese Black cattle."

The average incidence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections in ICUs is 41.7 cases/1,000 patients, highlighting the urgent need for more effective alternative therapies to replace carbapenems. Thus, this study aimed to investigate for the first time the antibacterial activity of curcumin in combination with the novel phage vB_AbaSI_1 to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in vitro. Phage vB_AbaSI_1 (capsid diameter 91 nm, contractile tail 94/20 nm) was isolated from sewage and infects ~ 29% of the 131 bacterial isolates examined. The 52,783 kb phage genome has 75 ORFs, encodes an integrase, lacks tRNAs/virulence genes, and belongs to the Caudoviricetes. Commercially sourced curcumin (400 µg/mL), combined with phage vB_AbaSI_1 (MOI 100) reduced MDR A. baumannii 131 to undetectable levels 1 h post-treatment at 37 °C, and this efficacy was further extended for 5 h in double-dosed phage/curcumin-treated cultures. In contrast, treatment with just phage vB_AbaSI_1 reduced bacterial growth but rebounded within 3 h, while curcumin-only treated cultures showed only 1-log bacterial reduction compared to untreated control. The phage/curcumin synergy occurred exclusively with phage-susceptible strains pre-curcumin exposure. This suggests the potential disruption of bacterial cell membrane during phage infection allowing curcumin entry, as no synergy was observed with phage-resistant strains. This innovative strategy of combining phage and curcumin showed great efficacy at controlling MDR A. baumannii and has a potential for therapeutic deployment. Future work will focus on engineering the phage to make it therapeutically acceptable."

Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance."

People travel with their mouth firmly in their body, yet the mouth's wellbeing does not rate a mention. This article represents the first exploration of a range of topics relevant to an until now neglected, yet potentially highly important, area of health care. A range of dental mishaps can occur while away from home, from simple toothache to accidents, serious emergencies, or restoration failures. Other problems originate in unwise behaviour, including holiday-inspired body modifications.Unless there is pain, teeth are typically not thought about much. However, examining the practical side of dental hygiene during travels, several overlooked and perhaps surprising topics emerge that - through the travel lens - take on a different and important role: the oral microbiome, toothbrush hygiene, the toilet plume, and traveller diarrhoea. Based on this discussion, recommendations are made for clinical practice, education, and further research.The historical chasm between dentistry and medicine, despite long-standing calls for change, does not seem to go away and impairs holistic high quality travel health care. Travel medicine can bypass this unproductive division. It has the unique opportunity to be the first medical specialty cooperating closely with dentists to bridge this gap by providing quality travel health care to travellers with all their body parts attached."

The isolates were characterized via molecular serotyping and MALDI-TOF proteomic analysis. Further analyses included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, biofilm formation assessment, and virulence gene investigation. A total of 24 L. monocytogenes strains were isolated. The prevalence in carcasses, hide and slaughterhouse environment was 21.7%, 6.7% and 8.8% respectively. Molecular serogroup IIc predominated, followed by serogroups IIa, IIb, and IVb. Almost all strains showed a moderate or strong ability to produce biofilms and resistance to at least one antimicrobial, with clindamycin, vancomycin, and tetracycline demonstrating the highest rates of resistance. Three strains were also characterized as multidrug-resistant, while all strains possessed at least six virulence genes. The proteomic analysis organized the isolated strains in three clusters, whereas the transmission pathways primarily implicated carcass washing water and hides. Understanding L.monocytogenes dissemination along the beef production chain is vital for preventing transmission to humans and emergence of a listeriosis outbreak."

        "abstract": "Cardiac looping is a crucial process during embryonic development. Abnormalities or failures in cardiac looping can lead to congenital heart defects, thereby affecting normal physiological function. Environmental pollutant exposure is one of the major causes of cardiac looping failure. D-tetramethrin is a hygienic insecticide widely used in households and public places, that can enter the human body through contact, insect transmission, and the food chain, thereby impacting human health. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations of D-tetramethrin to analyze its effects on heart development, and oxidative stress levels within the embryos. Additionally, qPCR was employed to analyze the transcription and the expression levels of genes related to heart development and function. The results showed that (1) D-tetramethrin exposure significantly reduced heart rate and increased the distance between the sinus venosus and the bulbus arteriosus (SV-BA), which suggested that D-tetramethrin induced cardiac looping failure and led to abnormal heart function. (2) D-tetramethrin exposure elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish embryos while decreasing the enzyme activities of key antioxidant stress enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). (3) D-tetramethrin exposure resulted in a significant downregulation of the transcription of cardiac looping-related genes (Myh6, Nkx2.5, Tbx2b, Tbx5a, Tnnt2c and Hand2) and heart function-related genes (Gata4, Vmhc and Nppa). Our findings indicate that D-tetramethrin causes the accumulation of ROS, which in turn alters the transcription levels of genes related to cardiac looping, ultimately resulting in cardiac looping failure."

Several studies have investigated the ability of gas plasma, a partially ionized gas that simultaneously generates several reactive species, to be a new antiviral tool. However, several aspects of the mechanisms of antiviral action of gas plasma remained elusive. In this study, we, for the first time, used a gas plasma device approved for medical purposes and routinely applied in the clinics, especially for wound healing, to test its antiviral activity against a murine corona-virus in vitro (MHV-GFP), a research model analogous to human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. For this, we established a novel high-content imaging assay that gave quantitative and kinetic information about infection and reduced viral activity in murine fibroblasts (17Cl-1) host cells. Gas plasma treatment delayed viral infectivity and reduced overall infection and toxicity in 17Cl1 cells. Various antioxidants at different concentrations were screened to identify ROS relevant to antiviral effects. Catalase provided no virus protection, and DMSO, mannitol, histidine, Trolox, and ascorbic acid only modestly reduced gas plasma virucidal efficacy. By contrast, glutathione, tyrosine, and cysteine showed profound but not complete protection of MHV from gas plasma-derived reactive species, suggesting pivotal roles of superoxide radicals and peroxynitrite gas in plasma-driven viral inactivation. At extended gas plasma exposure times, fewer intact MHV RNA were detected, indicative of reactive species-driven RNA modifications or degradation as an additional mechanism of action. Virus particle size changes measured by electron microscopy were moderate. Collectively, we identified the potent antiviral activity of a clinically approved argon plasma jet along with potential mechanisms of action."

Humans use mental models or schemas to understand the world. They assimilate new information based on their existing schemas. Those formally trained in radiological protection are well versed in the International System of Radiological Protection, based on the fundamental principles of justification, optimization, and limitation as described in International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 103. Those with training in occupational health and safety or industrial hygiene in Canada or the United States work within a framework called the hierarchy of controls.

Also linked to PD include human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). PD also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it triggers inflammatory reactions throughout the body. CVD and chronic PD were linked to significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood lipids. Furthermore, elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels may influence PD-related inflammation and periodontium degradation. In addition, there was a correlation between a reduction in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and a reduction in circulating oxidative stress (OS); this was shown to be achieved by improved dental hygiene and non-surgical periodontal treatment. Consequently, this research set out to examine the connections between lipid metabolism and PD, as well as the effects of PD on the efficacy of statins and other medications that decrease cholesterol, as well as inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs may affect gum and tooth health. We found that higher blood levels of bad cholesterol exacerbate PD. Furthermore, PD makes CVD worse. The involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in bacterial infections and the development of PD is inversely proportional to the increase in LDL levels. The treatment of this disease could, therefore, benefit greatly by inhibiting this chemical. Medications that lower cholesterol levels may potentially help treat this problem. The possible side effects of this medication on PD patients need more investigation. We have reviewed the literature on PD and its relationship to lipid metabolism, LDL receptors, and lipid rafts. Afterward, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism in the local viral infection that causes PD. Lastly, we examined how statins and other lipid-lowering medications impact PD."

This review characterises child public health indicators that are routinely collected, required by donors, and recommended for use in fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable (FCV) settings. We conducted database and grey literature searches and collected indicators from technical agencies, partnerships, donors, and nongovernmental organisations providing child public health services in FCV settings. Indicators were included if they were child-specific or disaggregated for ≤18 years. Indicators were coded into domains of health status, health service, social determinants, and health behaviours and analysed for trends in thematic focus and clarity. A total of 668 indicators were included. Routinely collected indicators (N = 152) focused on health status and health services. Donors required only 14 indicators. Technical bodies and academics recommended 502 indicators for routine measurement. Prioritised topics included nutrition, paediatrics, infectious diseases, mortality, and maternal-newborn care. There were notable gaps in indicators for child development and disability. Child protection indicators were not routinely collected, despite being the focus of 39% of recommended indicators. There were overlaps and duplications, varied age disaggregations, and 49% of indicators required interpretation to measure. The review demonstrates that it is feasible to routinely measure child public health outcomes in FCV settings. Recommendations from technical agencies and partnerships are characterised by numerous indicators with duplication, poor definitions, and siloed sector-specific focus. There are gaps in measurement of critical child public health topics. To improve safety and effectiveness of interventions for child public health, consensus is needed on priority topics and a shortlist of quality, standardised indicators that governmental and nongovernmental actors can be reasonably expected to measure. Indicators should be prioritised to support decision-making and include proxy indicators for periods when routine measurement is hampered."

Established in 2012, the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) addresses this need by collecting clinical and virological data on persons with acute respiratory illnesses across a network of hospitals worldwide. GIHSN utilizes a standardized patient enrolment and data collection protocol across its study sites. It leverages pre-existing national infrastructures and expert collaborations to facilitate comprehensive data collection. This includes demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and virologic data, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for a subset of viruses. Sequencing data are shared in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). GIHSN uses financing and governance approaches centered around public-private partnerships. Over time, GIHSN has included more than 100 hospitals across 27 countries and enrolled more than 168,000 hospitalized patients, identifying 27,562 cases of influenza and 44,629 of other respiratory viruses. GIHSN has expanded beyond influenza to include other respiratory viruses, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2023, GIHSN strengthened its global impact through a memorandum of understanding with the World Health Organization, aimed at enhancing collaborative efforts and data sharing for improved health responses. GIHSN exemplifies the value of integrating scientific research with public health initiatives through global collaboration and public-private partnerships governance. Future efforts should enhance the scalability of such models and ensure their sustainability through continued public and private support."

AGEs can arise endogenously under normal metabolic conditions and in pathological states such as diabetes, kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders. Additionally, they can be obtained exogenously through dietary intake, particularly from foods high in fat or sugar, as well as grilled and processed items. AGEs accumulate in various organs and have been increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the progression of numerous diseases, particularly kidney disease. As the kidney plays a crucial role in AGE metabolism and excretion, it is highly susceptible to AGE-induced damage. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the role of AGEs in the onset and progression of various kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, and acute kidney injury. We explore the potential biological mechanisms involved, such as AGE accumulation, the AGEs-RAGE axis, oxidative stress, inflammation, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and AGE-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, we discuss recent findings on the metabolic characteristics of AGEs in vivo and their pathogenic impact on renal function. Additionally, we examine the clinical significance of AGEs in the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of kidney diseases, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By integrating recent advancements in AGE research, this review aims to provide new insights and strategies for mitigating AGE-related renal damage and improving kidney disease management."

Bone metabolism plays a central role in the success of implant therapy. Diabetes mellitus is a significant disease impacting bone metabolism, particularly during the initial stages of osseointegration and in long-term survival. Moreover, aging is linked to various systemic conditions, such as diabetes, which increase the susceptibility of the periodontium and teeth to disease, often resulting in tooth loss. Studies on the impact of glycemic control on the success and longevity of implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in diabetic patients highlight a significant association between hyperglycemia and complications in implant therapy. This review identified 18 relevant publications through Medline, and studies were screened against the aim and objectives of the review. A total of five articles were excluded because of lack of focus on the effect of glycemic control on dental implants. Diabetic patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels may face a heightened risk of developing implant complications. Effective glycemic control plays a critical role in the long-term success of dental implants in these individuals. Marginal bone loss (MBL) is a critical indicator of implant health and success. Clinical studies generally show greater MBL in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic individuals. Furthermore, controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with significantly better maintenance."

This study explores the interaction between CD19 and CXCR4 signaling in the context of B-cell lymphomas, particularly focusing on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM). We assessed the roles of CD19 in survival and CXCL12-induced migration by using knockout (KO) cells of DLBCL and WM origin alongside evaluating the impact of CD19 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results highlight that CD19 is important for survival and CXCL12-induced migration, and mAbs variably increase CXCL12-induced migration and enhance ADCC. Additionally, we demonstrate that the endogenous peptide inhibitor of the CXCR4 (EPI-X4) derivative JM#21 effectively inhibits CD19-mediated migration enhancement and promotes ADCC, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of CD19 mAb-based immunotherapy in lymphoma models. Our study underscores the potential of targeting both CD19 and CXCR4 to refine therapeutic strategies for treating B-cell malignancies, suggesting a synergistic approach could improve clinical outcomes in WM treatment."

Floods pose risks to the affected populations, including an increase in communicable diseases mainly due to population displacement and overcrowding, deficiencies in hygiene and dietary measures and difficulties accessing health care. The most frequently reported infectious diseases in the context of these disasters are gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and diseases resulting from wound infection. Epidemic outbreaks of infections such as leptospirosis or vector-borne diseases, which are usually less prevalent but whose increased incidence is closely related to this type of disasters, have also been described. These events evince the need to develop epidemiological surveillance protocols and for scientific societies to establish consensus-based guidelines for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of the most prevalent communicable diseases. This consensus document was developed by the Sociedad Española de Infectología Pediátrica (SEIP) in collaboration with the Asociación Española de Pediatría (AEP) and the Sociedad Valenciana de Pediatría (SVP) to establish recommendations for the therapeutic management of the main infectious diseases that may affect children impacted by floods, which could also be applicable to other natural disasters."

However, because of limited vaccine supply, New York City (NYC) prioritized single dose vaccination. We estimated mpox cases averted by this strategy compared to strategies that prioritized 2-dose vaccination for a smaller portion of the population. We fit a network transmission model to incident mpox cases in NYC. Model output consisted of predicted cases over time when vaccine doses were administered with the 'first-dose priority' strategy, compared with counterfactual simulations where doses were administered to those eligible for a second dose ahead of those waiting for a first dose ('intermediate' strategy), or where individuals were pre-allocated full courses of the vaccine ('second-dose priority' strategy). We estimate that NYC's strategy averted 66% [IQR:47%-78%] of potential mpox cases compared to no vaccination. This 'first-dose priority' strategy averted 0.6% [IQR:-11%-9.8%] more cases than the 'intermediate' strategy, and 17% [IQR:2.9%-38%] more cases than the 'second-dose priority' strategy. Thus, for the 2022 mpox outbreak in NYC, pre-allocating vaccine doses to ensure full vaccination in a high-priority subset of the population would have increased the size of the outbreak."

In this study, we employed the Quasi Vivo 900 medium perfusion system (QV900, Kirkstall Ltd, UK) to simulate physiological fluid flow, allowing us to compare macrophage responses and therapeutic outcomes under dynamic versus static conditions. After 24 hours, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis decreased in all cell types under flow conditions compared to static cultures. Under slow (1.45 x 10-9 m/s) and faster (1.23 x 10-7 m/s) flow conditions ((simulating in vivo lymphatic flow), phagocytosis decreased by around 42.55% and 56.98% in peritoneal macrophages (PEMs), 42.21% and 56.11% in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), and 49.75% and 63.32% in THP-1 cells, respectively. Similarly, macropinocytosis decreased by approximately 40.7% and 62.2% in PEMs, 34.8% and 60.9% in BMMs, and 33.3% and 59.3% in THP-1 cell line under this same conditions. In this study, we further assessed the impact of medium perfusion on drug efficacy and macrophage functions using a Leishmania major amastigote-macrophage assay. We evaluated the performance of both standard and nanoparticle-based drug formulations within dynamic and static culture systems. After 72 hours of medium perfusion, chitosan solution, blank chitosan-sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles, and amphotericin B (AmB)-loaded chitosan-TPP nanoparticles exhibited a statistically significant reduction in antileishmanial activity by approximately 30-50% under slow flow conditions and 60-80% under faster flow conditions. In comparison, pure AmB showed a 40% decrease in efficacy at slow flow and a 67% decrease at faster flow, both statistically significant. These results highlighted the importance of considering fluid flow dynamics in in vitro studies for a more accurate simulation of in vivo conditions, potentially leading to better therapeutic strategies for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)."

Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, is a gold standard treatment for opioid use disorder, improving withdrawal symptoms and decreasing opioid-related mortality. However, a 2022 Food and Drug Administration warning about oral health problems related to transmucosal formulations has precipitated new research into this medication's potential risks. Two timely studies included in this issue of Journal of Addiction Medicine provide important new insight into potential causal effects and mechanisms of transmucosal buprenorphine's impact on oral disease. Using propensity score-weighted survival analysis, Tuan and colleagues demonstrated significantly greater risk for oral health problems in patients with opioid use disorder exposed to transmucosal buprenorphine compared to those not exposed. Taking a vastly different approach, Zheng and colleagues explored mechanisms of oral health risk by exposing rats to transmucosal or intravenous buprenorphine. Results described prolonged oral fluid buprenorphine exposure, a condition proposed to increase risk for tooth decay, was associated with greater accumulated buprenorphine in the salivary gland associated with sublingual buprenorphine administration. These novel studies advance our understanding of the plausibility of a causal relationship between transmucosal buprenorphine and oral health problems and suggest the importance of prescriber-patient discussions about risk mitigating oral hygiene practices and close monitoring of oral disease development. Additional research is needed into the relative oral health risks of full-opioid agonist versus transmucosal buprenorphine exposure and current barriers to long-acting injectable buprenorphine."

Comorbidity in patients with periodontitis with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis has been documented. In immunopathogenesis, it has been described that interleukin 17 participates in periodontitis and autoimmune diseases. In this regard, interleukin 17 induces the expression of β-defensin-2, an antimicrobial peptide with a proinflammatory effect. Currently, it is not known how periodontal therapy impacts the production of interleukin 17 and β-defensin-2. This is the first case report exploring the modification of interleukin 17/β-defensin-2 in a patient with periodontitis or autoimmunity, showing the importance and effect of non-surgical therapy on modifications of the immune response at the molecular level. The aim of this work is to evaluate the clinical improvement and the levels of interleukin 17/β-defensin-2 in saliva before and after periodontal treatment in a patient with periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. We present the case of a 51-year-old male patient with a history of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. On periodontal examination, he presented with periodontal pockets greater than 5 mm in 19 periodontal sites, with 100% bleeding on probing, and tooth mobility grades II and III in most of the dental organ. Subgingival instrumentation and oral hygiene instructions were performed. The patient showed favorable progress, with a reduction in periodontal pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and tooth mobility. Interleukin 17 levels were higher and β-defensin-2 levels were lower post-treatment. Non-surgical treatment decreased the inflammatory activity of periodontal disease, which led to increased interleukin 17 and decreased β-defensin-2 in saliva samples. The decrease in β-defensin-2 suggests its usefulness as a marker of inflammatory activity in periodontal disease."

        "abstract": "The benefits of returning clinically actionable genetic results to participants in research cohorts are accruing, yet such a genome-first approach is challenging. Here, we describe the implementation of return of such results in two founder populations from Scotland. Between 2005 and 2015, we recruited >4,000 adults with grandparents from Orkney and Shetland into the Viking Genes research cohort. The return of genetic data was not offered at baseline, but in 2023, we sent invitations to participants for consent to return of actionable genetic findings. We generated exome sequence data from 4,198 participants and used the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) v.3.2 list of 81 genes, ClinVar review, and pathogenicity status, plus manual curation, to develop a pipeline to identify potentially actionable variants. We identified 104 individuals (2.5%) with 108 actionable genotypes at 39 variants in 23 genes and validated these. Working with the NHS Clinical Genetics service, which provided genetic counseling and clinical verification of the research results, and after expert clinical review, we notified 64 consenting participants (or their next of kin) of their actionable genotypes. Ten actionable variants across seven genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATP7B, TTN, KCNH2, MUTYH, and GAA) have risen 50- to >3,000-fold in frequency through genetic drift in ancestral island localities. Viking Genes is one of the first UK research cohorts to return actionable findings, providing an ethical and logistical exemplar of return of results. The genetic structure in the Northern Isles of Scotland with multiple founder effects provides a unique opportunity for a tailored approach to disease prevention through genetic screening."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Initiated by bacteria, periodontitis (PD) is a complex, chronic inflammatory disease of the supporting tissue of the gums and teeth. Also linked to PD include human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). PD also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it triggers inflammatory reactions throughout the body. CVD and chronic PD were linked to significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood lipids. Furthermore, elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels may influence PD-related inflammation and periodontium degradation. In addition, there was a correlation between a reduction in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and a reduction in circulating oxidative stress (OS); this was shown to be achieved by improved dental hygiene and non-surgical periodontal treatment. Consequently, this research set out to examine the connections between lipid metabolism and PD, as well as the effects of PD on the efficacy of statins and other medications that decrease cholesterol, as well as inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs may affect gum and tooth health. We found that higher blood levels of bad cholesterol exacerbate PD. Furthermore, PD makes CVD worse. The involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in bacterial infections and the development of PD is inversely proportional to the increase in LDL levels. The treatment of this disease could, therefore, benefit greatly by inhibiting this chemical. Medications that lower cholesterol levels may potentially help treat this problem. The possible side effects of this medication on PD patients need more investigation. We have reviewed the literature on PD and its relationship to lipid metabolism, LDL receptors, and lipid rafts. Afterward, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism in the local viral infection that causes PD. Lastly, we examined how statins and other lipid-lowering medications impact PD."

The major causative factor for cervical cancer is primary prolonged infection with human papillomavirus, along with secondary factors such as immunodeficiency, smoking, low socioeconomic standards, poor hygiene, and overuse of oral contraceptives. A grave need exists to practice novel strategies to overcome existing drawbacks of conventional therapy such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Cancer immunotherapy works by strengthening the immune system of the host to combat against the cancerous cells. Immunotherapy in cervical cancer treatment has demonstrated long-lasting effects; however, the response to such therapies was nominal due to its prominent limitations such as immunosuppressive behavior of the tumor. Presently plethora of nanoplatforms such as polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers are being maneuvered with cancer immunotherapy. The amalgamation of nanotechnology and immunotherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer is conceivable due to the mutual association between the tumor microenvironment and immunosurveillance. Safety concerns of nanoplatforms with immunotherapeutics such as toxicity, inflammation, and unwanted accumulation in tissues could be surmounted by surface modification methods. This review highlights the benefits of the amalgamation of nanotechnology and immunotherapy to improve shortcomings applicable to the conventional delivery of cancer treatment. We also aim to outline the nanoimmunotherapy sophistications and future translational avenues in this rapidly flourishing cancer treatment modality."

This review aims to explore the functional outcomes of patients with bilateral RSA and examine the effect of risk factors and implant positioning on internal rotation. Multiple studies have reported favorable results in bilateral RSA patients, with significantly improved patient-reported and clinical outcomes bilaterally. Although challenges remain in achieving reliable improvements in internal rotation following RSA, several studies to date have demonstrated that bilateral RSA patients are able to retain independence in personal hygiene and activities of daily living, with difficulty experienced primarily only in extreme internal rotation tasks, such as washing the back or securing a bra. Nevertheless, compensatory strategies can enable patients to manage these limitations effectively. Patients who have undergone bilateral RSA demonstrate functional outcomes and perform internal rotation tasks at a level comparable to that of patients who have undergone bilateral anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty or a combination of total shoulder arthroplasty and RSA. Risk factors for internal rotation deficits after RSA include poor preoperative functional internal rotation, increased body mass index, preoperative opioid use, and preoperative diagnosis of a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear. Lateralization and inferior positioning of the glenoid component as well as humeral component retroversion can increase functional internal rotation, while repairing the subscapularis does not appear to offer any clinically significant benefit. Although some patient and surgical factors have been associated with internal rotation deficits after RSA, further investigation is necessary to better characterize the underlying causes of this issue."

Multiple barriers impede access to diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS), creating significant public health challenges in regions with high DM prevalence. This study explores the perspectives of people with DM (PwDM) and healthcare providers (HCP) on these barriers. A qualitative study using in-depth interviews (IDI) was conducted between October 2022 and January 2023 in Punjab and Chandigarh. Through purposive sampling, IDIs were conducted with 7 PwDM and 19 HCPs, including retina specialists, ophthalmologists, optometrists, medical officers (MO), Community Health Officers (CHO), and ASHA workers from various public health facilities. A semi-structured topic guide facilitated the interviews, and thematic analysis was applied, utilizing the healthcare access barrier (HCAB) model as a framework. The study identified financial barriers due to insurance unawareness and employment constraints. Structural challenges included insufficient DRS infrastructure, untrained staff, the need for accompaniment, and limited access to screening sites. Limited awareness and misconceptions about DR characterized cognitive barriers, while psychological barriers involved mistrust of the health system, anxiety, and frustration from low vision. Addressing these issues is essential to improve DRS uptake and eye health outcomes. Managing diabetes and VTDR is challenging, highlighting the need for community-level DRS. Enhancing DR awareness and promoting public health insurance benefits are crucial for overcoming barriers and improving screening rates."

Community-based doula care is an evidence-based strategy to improve maternal health through accompaniment, health care engagement, addressing social needs, and promoting respectful care. Yet, there is a gap in access to doula care for people who are low-income or publicly insured, due to cost and availability. New York has recently joined a growing number of states providing Medicaid coverage for doula services. There are many challenges to overcome for this benefit to succeed: limited workforce capacity, minimal integration of doulas into hospitals, and reimbursement challenges. We offer a case study for integrating doula services into hospital-based maternity care: the HOPE Program (Helping Promote Birth-Equity through Community-Based Doula Care). Through community engagement, we have co-designed a model that centers the needs and experiences of birthing people and their care-giving teams. The model illustrates strategies for hospital-community engagement, tailored doula workforce expansion, and integration of doulas into clinical spaces and teams. Investment in these components will lead to a meaningful expansion of doula services to the populations around the state and country who need it most."

A balanced oral microbiome is associated with good oral health, and disruption can result in imbalance associated with diseases including gingivitis and dental caries. It is important, therefore, to understand how daily use of oral hygiene products impacts the microbiome. Composition and activity of dental plaque microbiome from 115 participants was analysed after brushing with one of two toothpastes, one containing zinc citrate trihydrate and the other a control toothpaste, in a parallel design. Each participant brushed twice daily for 6-weeks, with samples collected at baseline, 2 and 6-weeks. Metataxonomic analysis demonstrated changes in bacterial communities with use of the zinc toothpaste compared to the control product at community and species level. Increases at the species level were observed for taxa from the genus Veillonella with decrease in a taxon from the genus Fusobacterium for the zinc toothpaste. Analysis of microbiome function based on predicted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis show that use of the zinc toothpaste is associated with an in-vivo reduction in glycolysis, consistent with the mode of action of zinc and, increases in processes linked to gum-health (lysine biosynthesis), and to whole-body health (nitrate reduction). Our findings provide the first understanding of the beneficial modulation of microbiome composition and function by zinc-containing toothpaste in-vivo for oral care benefits."

Guidelines have been summarised from multiple countries, some of which offer guidance for antimicrobial use at end of life. Countries at different income levels are included (ie, Chile, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sudan) to show how practice norms and standards vary internationally. These examples are combined with a case of non-beneficial end-of-life antimicrobial use and clinical guidance for patient and family communication regarding antimicrobial treatment.

        "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood hematological malignancy, but it also affects adult patients with worse prognosis and outcomes. Leukemic cells benefit from protective mechanisms, which are mediated by intercellular signaling molecules - cytokines. Through these signals, cytokines modulate the biology of leukemic cells and their surroundings, enhancing the proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of the disease. This ultimately leads to disease progression, refractoriness, and relapse, decreasing the chances of curability and overall survival of the patients. Targeting and modulating these pathological processes without affecting the healthy physiology is desirable, offering more possibilities for the treatment of ALL patients, which still remains unsatisfactory in certain cases. In this review, we comprehensively analyze the existing literature and ongoing trials regarding the role of chemokines and interleukins in the biology of ALL. Focusing on the functional pathways, genetic background, and critical checkpoints, we constructed a summary of molecules that are promising for prognostic stratification and mainly therapeutic use. Targeted therapy, including chemokine and interleukin pathways, is a new and promising approach to the treatment of cancer. With the expansion of our knowledge, we are able to uncover a spectrum of new potential checkpoints in order to modulate the disease biology. Several cytokine-related targets are advancing toward clinical application, offering the hope of higher disease response rates to treatment."

The study aimed to explore drug use and its relationship with academic performance among university students in Castilla y León, Spain. Additionally, it sought to determine whether significant differences in academic performance were associated with potential predictor variables, including absenteeism, substance use, traits of emerging adulthood, and other health-related factors such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The results indicated higher consumption rates of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis compared to those reported in the Household Survey on Alcohol and Drugs in Spain (EDADES 2022) for individuals aged 15 to 34 in Castilla y León. A relationship between substance use and academic performance was identified, with performance differences observed based on the type of consumer. Although the predictive contribution of the variables included in the regression model was low (10.6%), it remained significant, suggesting the need to refine the model by incorporating additional variables to enhance understanding of the phenomenon. These findings can assist universities in designing preventive interventions."

To mitigate the non-specific, high toxicity of PTX towards cardiomyocytes, we propose the application of newly synthesized SDS-based polyelectrolyte multicore nanocapsules. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that SDS-based NCs can mitigate the cytotoxic effects of PTX on cardiac cells and serve as effective nanocarriers for this drug. We investigated two types of multicore NCs with differing polyelectrolyte coatings: poly-L-lysine (PLL) and a combination of PLL with poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA). The cytotoxicity of the formulated nanosystems was evaluated using HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Oxygraphy, flow cytometry, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, fluorescence microscopy, and RT-PCR were employed to assess disruptions in cardiac cellular homeostasis. Our data revealed that, among the tested NCs, SDS/PLL/PGA/PTX exhibited reduced cardiotoxicity and were better tolerated by HL-1 cardiomyocytes compared to SDS/PLL/PTX or PTX alone. In addition, SDS/PLL/PGA/PTX showed a marginal disruption of mitochondria's homeostasis, and no changes in APT level and intracellular calcium concentrations were observed. These findings underscore the potential of SDS-based multicore nanocarriers in anticancer therapy, particularly due to diminished cardiotoxicity and long-term stability in the biological fluids."

Similarly, pain is prevalent in this population and can negatively affect students' psychological, social, and academic functioning. However, the limited research examining associations between pain and alcohol-related constructs among college students has yielded inconsistent results. Individual differences in levels of reward and relief drinking motives (i.e., drinking in response to positive affect/social situations versus negative affect/stressful situations) may contribute to the complex, heterogeneous nature of these associations. The aim of the present study was to examine the moderating effects of reward and relief drinking on the association between pain and alcohol-related negative consequences in college students who binge drink. Participants were 436 college students who had engaged in past-month binge drinking. Most participants identified as White (66.7 %) and female (78.2 %), with a mean age of 19.62 (SD = 1.56) years. Results revealed significant moderating effects of both reward and relief motives on the association between pain at time 1 and alcohol-related negative consequences at time 2. In participants with either higher levels of relief or lower levels of reward drinking greater pain was significantly associated with a higher number of alcohol-related negative consequences. In participants demonstrating higher levels of reward drinking, greater pain was significantly associated with a lower number of alcohol-related negative consequences. Our work indicates targeting pain as a possible intervention to prevent alcohol-related negative consequences among those who report lower levels of reward or higher levels of relief drinking."

The optimal extraction conditions were identified as a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:11 g/mL, an alcohol concentration of 55%, an enzyme concentration of 1.2%, and an extraction temperature of 40°C. The yields of flavonoids, polysaccharides, and triterpenoids obtained were 0.94 ± 0.05, 260.46 ± 1.78, and 118.69 ± 0.71 mg/g, respectively, demonstrating increases of 59.19%, 29.03%, and 46.10% compared to HL (HL, the traditional reflux extraction method). Furthermore, in vitro digestion of the GLXB extract demonstrated significant lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic effects. The GLXB extract facilitated the flocculation of lipid droplets during lipid digestion and exhibited the capacity to reduce the rate of fat digestion. These findings indicate that the U-EAT significantly enhanced the content of active ingredients in GLXB and improved the hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering activities of the GLXB extract, highlighting its potential for further development and application in functional foods."

This research aims to identify key factors students see as contributing to non-consensual sex with a view to developing effective strategies to address these issues. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 4291 university students attending universities in south-east Queensland, Australia. Participants were recruited via email, print media, and face-to-face invitations. The survey contained closed and open-ended questions on a range of sexual health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, including non-consensual sexual experiences. A subset of students (n =199) who responded 'yes' to engaging in sexual acts against their consent were the primary participants for this paper. Descriptive statistical analysis and thematic analysis, employing the theory of planned behaviour, were conducted using the quantitative and qualitative data regarding non-consensual sex, respectively. Results Immediate and longer-term fear and partner eagerness were the most commonly identified influences on non-consensual sex. An inability to give consent due to lack of consciousness or intoxication were also frequently cited factors contributing to non-consensual sex. Conclusions Interventions acknowledging and addressing sociocultural factors are needed. Sexuality and relationship education encompassing effective communication, relationship boundaries, and safe use of alcohol and drugs could substantially reduce the incidence of non-consensual sex. Importantly, such education should be non-judgmental and place greater responsibility on perpetrators than victim-survivors."

        "abstract": "Following a period of disuse owing to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, colistin has regained global attention as an antibiotic of last resort. The resurgence in its utilization has led to a concurrent increase in acquired resistance, presenting a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Predominantly, resistance mechanisms involve alterations in the lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure. These alterations are facilitated by the addition of cationic phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) or 4-amino-L-arabinose, often driven by the upregulation of two-component regulatory systems such as PmrAB and PhoPQ. Structural components of bacteria, such as capsules and efflux pumps, can also play an important role in the resistance mechanism. In addition to these biochemical modifications, structural components of bacteria like capsules and efflux pumps also play crucial roles in mediating resistance. Another significant mechanism is the acquisition of the plasmid-mediated mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) gene, which poses a global health threat due to its ability to transfer between different bacterial genera. Contemporary strategies to combat colistin resistance include the development and use of novel drugs and inhibitors. To devise effective interventions, it is imperative to first elucidate the precise mechanisms of colistin resistance and determine the roles of various contributing factors."

In this regard, we developed dextran based composite hydrogel incorporating doxorubicin-loaded dual-sensitive pH-redox nanogels (DOX-DSNG) and combretastatin A4 (CA4) loaded liposomes which undergo rapid disassembly in cancer cells. CA4 prevents tubulin polymerization and thus inhibits angiogenesis by binding to vascular endothelial tubulin. The results showed that DOX-DSNGs were negatively charged and 144.8 ± 0.85 nm in size. Besides, the size of CA4 loaded liposomes were 102.35 ± 4.22 nm and were negatively charged. Encapsulation efficiency of DOX-DSNGs and CA4 loaded liposomes were 100 % and 89 %, respectively.

A resident specialising in internal medicine died by suicide after experiencing extraordinary workloads, including 236 h of overtime in the month before his death. This case underscores the broader systemic issue of excessive working hours in Japan's medical profession, exacerbated by the country's 'passion pay' culture, which exploits young physicians' dedication. Surveys indicate that 28% of residents experience burnout, with long hours, inefficient task allocation and poor workplace communication as key stressors. Addressing excessive workloads requires restructuring physician responsibilities. Research shows that full-time physicians under 50 spend significant time on non-medical tasks that could be delegated to other professionals. The primary physician model, which holds doctors responsible for patients beyond their shifts, further extends work hours. Transitioning to a time-based task allocation system and implementing task-shifting strategies could alleviate these burdens. Workplace communication also requires improvement. Limited supervisory support and hierarchical barriers prevent open discussions about well-being. We underscore that drawing insights from corporate strategies, such as Marui Group's task optimisation policies and TOYOTA's anonymous feedback system, hospitals could implement structured well-being initiatives for physicians. Physician well-being directly correlates with patient satisfaction and treatment adherence. Addressing burnout through workload reduction and improved communication is essential for maintaining both doctor and patient health. Hospitals must prioritise physician well-being alongside patient care, fostering a sustainable working environment for medical professionals."

        "abstract": "Advanced multi-wavelength pulsed laser is a key technique for functional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM). By utilizing the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effect, we can generate various wavelengths from a single-wavelength pump laser, offering a simple and cost-effective solution for OR-PAM. However, existing multi-wavelength SRS lasers typically require fine alignment of many free-space optical components with single-mode fibers, which are susceptible to mechanical disturbances and temperature fluctuations, leading to high maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we develop an all-fiber three-wavelength SRS laser source for functional OR-PAM. A pump laser beam is launched into an optical fiber network, which splits and delays these laser pulses and generates different optical wavelengths in different fiber branches, and then merges them at the output end of the fiber network. This approach requires only one instance of fiber launching, dramatically simplifying the alignment and improving the laser stability. Using a decoding algorithm, we can separate the PA signals from different optical wavelengths and then calculate oxygen saturation (sO"

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is a state of difficulty maintaining voluntary activity. Cortisol, which is essential for stress regulation, can cause tissue damage when elevated for long periods of time, which is a common problem for office workers in stressful environments. Sleep quality is important for health and cognitive function, while sleep deprivation increases the risk of physical and mental health disorders. Gyrokinesis combines circular, spiral, and wave movements influenced by yoga, tai chi, and ballet to provide a calming effect on the sympathetic nervous system. This study investigated the effects of Gyrokinesis exercise on lower extremity edema, muscle strength, fatigue, and sleep quality in sedentary office workers. Twenty-seven adult women aged 20-40 years were randomly assigned to a Gyrokinesis exercise group (n=14) or a control group (n=13). The exercise group participated in 60-min Gyrokinesis sessions twice a week for 8 weeks, while the control group used elastic compression stockings during their working hours. Results showed a significant decrease in fatigue and an improvement in sleep quality in the exercise group. Cortisol and serotonin levels showed a significant between-group interaction effect, with within-group changes observed only in the exercise group. Sleep quality indices improved significantly over time. In conclusion, Gyrokinesis exercise has the potential to improve physical and psychological well-being in sedentary office workers by positively influencing fatigue, sleep quality, and related hormone levels."

        "abstract": "Avoiding lattice oxygen involvement (oxygen redox) while promoting the coupling of adjacent adsorbed oxygen (metal redox) during the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for gaining high activity and robust stability in RuO2-based catalysts but remains elusive. Here, we present a precise strategy to selectively activate the metal redox process while suppressing the undesired oxygen redox pathway by fine-tuning the Ru-O coordination number in amorphous RuOx. The optimized catalyst exhibits outstanding acidic OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and maintaining stability for 300 hours with a negligible degradation rate of 100 μV h-1. X-ray absorption measurements and multiple operando spectra reveal that only Ru2-O11 moieties can selectively activate the metal redox process, whereas Ru2-O9 and Ru2-O8 moieties either trigger both redox pathways or bypass them. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru2-O11 moiety reduces crystal field splitting energy at active Ru sites, disables lattice oxygen activation, and lowers the energy barrier for oxygen coupling. The strategy developed in this work offers new avenues for switching redox centers and refining OER mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance and long-term stability."

We present a 74-year-old Chinese female patient undergoing an open total pancreatectomy and splenectomy using the bilateral EOI block as the primary analgesia technique. A bilateral EOI block was performed preoperatively using 25 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine, and a catheter was inserted into the EOI plane for postoperative analgesia. No long-acting opioids were used intraoperatively. Twenty-five milliliters of 0.2% ropivacaine was supplemented through the catheter 30 minutes prior to the end of surgery. She emerged from anesthesia and reported only mild discomfort at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Postoperatively, the EOI catheters were kept for five days, and the patient only required the addition of regular 1 g of intravenous paracetamol every six hours to maintain effective analgesia. Only two doses of 50 mg intravenous tramadol were administered in the first 12 hours as rescue analgesia. We demonstrated that EOI block can provide effective analgesia for upper abdominal surgery, achieving a significant opioid-sparing effect intraoperatively and opioid reduction during the postoperative period."

This scoping review aimed to synthesize evidence from published and grey literature on workplace mental health promotion interventions targeting African healthcare workers using Social Ecological Model (SEM) and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model as an underlying theoretical framework for analysis. Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews was used. The search was conducted across multiple databases. A total of 5590 results were retrieved from Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science. Seventeen (17) studies from ten (10) African countries were included after title, abstract and full text screening. Thematic analysis identified 5 key themes namely training programs, counselling services, peer support programs, relaxation techniques and informational resources. In conclusion, even though limited workplace mental health interventions for healthcare professionals were identified in Africa, individual-level interventions have been notably substantial in comparison to organizational and policy-level initiatives. Moving forward, a multi-faceted approach unique to the African context is essential."

        "abstract": "Over the last few years, numerous hospitals in France have been subject to increasingly frequent and severe cyberattacks that have disrupted healthcare provision to varying degrees. To mitigate this threat, especially in light of the forthcoming 2024 Olympic Games, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris in Paris has been developing contingency plans that have been tested in simulated exercises called CRYPTolocker EXercice since May 2021. The latest simulated ransomware cyberattack that involved more than 200 participants took place on July 5, 2023, and lasted for 24 hours. Although cybersecurity contingency plans are confidential for obvious reasons, this article presents the multidisciplinary organization of the simulated attack based on previous experiences from other hospitals and general findings that are in the public domain. It was found that the procedures in place worked well overall, and countermeasures were quickly implemented to limit the severity of this simulated cyberattack. However, failings were observed in intra- and extra-hospital communication, and conflicting priorities between different categories of personnel (administrative, managerial, and clinical) hampered the information technology team in resolving various issues. Furthermore, it was found that mental fatigue, task saturation, and information overload may have overwhelmed senior managers at sporadic intervals. This often resulted in an action-reaction approach being used to find temporary solutions to immediate problems. Consequently, senior managers who participated in this simulated cyberattack were unable to think strategically and anticipate demands for middle- and long-term issues. This unprecedented exercise was an important learning experience for all participants, and the lessons learned will help further improve contingency planning and cyber resilience. It advised that all hospitals worldwide adopt and develop a similar multidisciplinary approach (taking into account their local contexts) to limit the deleterious effects of a potential cyberattack that undoubtedly will become more prevalent in the future."

I use the small nematode worm C. elegans in my research to understand cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and I've taught and mentored hundreds of undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs and many junior faculty. Young scientists often become discouraged during their training-the modest pay, the long hours, and the herculean task and many setbacks that occur conducting research, writing grants and papers, teaching, and managing a lab. It can seem to be an impossible challenge and leads many young scientists to curtail their training and leave fulfilling scientific careers. A core element to success is that scientific skills and expertise evolve slowly over an entire career through engagement-learning by doing-and requires patience, acceptance of failures, continual exploration, and a flexible growth mindset. Everyone also takes a unique path and there is no simple rulebook. This is difficult to convey through courses and workshops. By sharing some tools and approaches I've learned through my own setbacks, observations, and reading, I hope to help junior scientists view challenges in this career more as lifelong opportunities for building new skillsets and growth, much like the emergence of form and function that occurs during developmental morphogenesis. Embracing constant change and evolution can lead to a deeply meaningful and fulfilling career."

Here, we describe in situ formation of an adhesive lubricative Janus nanocoating (ALJN) to enable long-lasting comfort drug delivery. By iron complexation, an asymmetric ALJN is formed on ocular surface via facile sequential instillation. The adhesive polyphenol inner layer binding with ocular surface enables drug loading and sustained release, while the lubricative zwitterionic polymer outer layer prevents eyelid adhesion to ensure comfort. Following instillation, ALJN retains on ocular surface over 24 hours and reduces blinking frequency to normal level. Moreover, ALJN demonstrates remarkable therapeutic potential in mouse and rabbit models of corneal contusion and alkali burn. This work proposes a comfortable long-lasting topical delivery platform for treating various ocular diseases."

Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g-1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony-chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7-99.8%), long lifespan (7,300 hours, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb‖MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g-1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50,000 cycles (~70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high-capacity cathode, which can integrate with low-potential zinc into novel dual-metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 hours). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high-charge-density cations for multivalent battery applications."

Although the quality of childcare is generally poor in these preschools, extremely long school hours and prolonged separation from primary caregivers may induce additional stress and lead to school maladjustment among boarding preschoolers. This study examines the impact of boarding experience on preschool beginners' social adjustment and stress responses, as indicated by their saliva alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol. A total of over 900 saliva samples of 31 boarding and 30 non-boarding preschoolers (mean age = 44.0 months, SD = 9.8 months) were collected over 12 weeks after they entered preschools. Primary caregivers reported children's behavioural problems and school refusal. Boarders experienced a larger mid-morning to mid-afternoon rise in cortisol than non-boarders on the second-to-last weekdays but not on the first weekdays. Non-boarders experienced an accelerated decrease in sAA during the 12 weeks, whereas boarders did not. Differences in cortisol and sAA patterns indicate potential increased stress for boarders, which might be associated with their more prevalent school-refusal behaviour than non-boarders. The findings underscore that entry into boarding preschool may cause stress and school refusal in rural Chinese children during their transition to preschool. Additional contacts with primary caregivers during this transition are needed to support boarders emotionally."

The lifestyle of a long-haul CMV driver may include long and irregular work hours, inconsistent sleep schedules, poor eating and exercise habits, and mental and physical stress, all contributors to fatigue. Shiftwork is associated with lacking, restricted, and poor-quality sleep and variations in circadian rhythms, all shown to negatively affect driving performance through impaired in judgment and coordination, longer reaction times, and cognitive impairment. Overweight and obesity may be as high as 90% in CMV drivers, and are associated with prevalent comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. As cognitive and motor processing declines with fatigue, driver performance decreases, and the risk of errors, near crashes, and crashes increases. Tools and assessments to determine and quantify the nature, severity, and impact of fatigue and sleep disorders across a variety of environments and populations have been developed and should be critically examined before being employed with CMV drivers. Strategies to mitigate fatigue in CMV operations include addressing the numerous personal, health, and work factors contributing to fatigue and sleepiness. Further research is needed across these areas to better understand implications for roadway safety."

In addition to demographics and work schedule, passenger and freight train drivers (n = 751) answered questions about: (1) Sleep duration; (2) wellbeing, including physical and mental health, the extent to which shiftwork causes sleep, social, domestic, and work problems, and (3) the extent to which ten fatigue, health and wellbeing factors in the work and home environment negatively impact their driving performance. The key factor that emerged from analyses, with the largest and most consistent negative effects (and controlling for other factors) was schedule irregularity. Approved rosters were ranked as having the most important impact on day-to-day driving performance, followed by physical and mental health, and outside work factors. Results also suggested that schedule irregularity may amplify the negative impacts of the roster, impaired physical and mental health, and outside work factors on driving performance. As shift variability and schedule irregularity are often poorly represented in existing industry guidance, these results provide evidence for increased reflection on current fatigue management guidelines for train drivers and suggest a need for greater focus on schedule irregularity through the lens of a systems approach."

        "data": "2021",
        "abstract": "OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONSDriving and survey data were collected from nurses following the night-shift and analyzed with logistic regression and frequency analysis. The analyses showed that prior near-crashes and drive length contributed significantly to near-crashes. The frequency analysis showed that most near-crashes occurred on major roadways, including principal arterials, major collectors, and interstates, within the first 15 minutes of the drive. These results highlight the urgent need for countermeasures to prevent drowsy driving incidents among night-shift nurses. Specifically, nurses and hospital systems should focus on countermeasures that encourage taking a break on the post work commute and those that can intervene during the drive. This may include the use of educational programs to teach nurses the importance of adequate rest or taking a break to sleep during their drive home, or technology that can recognize drowsiness and alert nurses of their drowsiness levels, prompting them to take a break."

        "abstract": "Physician burnout is a serious and growing threat to the medical profession and may undermine efforts to maintain a sufficient physician workforce to care for the growing and aging patient population in the United States. Burnout involves a host of complex underlying associations and potential for risk. While prevalence is unknown, recent estimates of physician burnout are quite high, approaching 50% or more, with midcareer physicians at highest risk. Sleep deprivation due to shift-work schedules, high workload, long hours, sleep interruptions, and insufficient recovery sleep have been implicated in the genesis and perpetuation of burnout. Maladaptive attitudes regarding sleep and endurance also may increase the risk for sleep deprivation among attending physicians. While duty-hour restrictions have been instituted to protect sleep opportunity among trainees, virtually no such effort has been made for attending physicians who have completed their training or practicing physicians in nonacademic settings. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that a critical need exists to evaluate the roles of sleep disruption, sleep deprivation, and circadian misalignment in physician well-being and burnout. Such evaluation may pave the way for the development of effective countermeasures that promote healthy sleep, with the goal of reducing burnout and its negative impacts such as a shrinking physician workforce, poor physician health and functional outcomes, lower quality of care, and compromised patient safety."

        "data": "2011",
        "abstract": "Several attributes of the work schedule can increase the risk of occupational injuries and accidents, health impairments, and reduced social participation. Although previous studies mainly focused on the effects of shiftwork and long working hours on employee health and safety, there is little evidence of a potential negative impact of working Sundays on the incidence of occupational accidents, health impairments, and work-life balance. A representative sample of employed workers in 31 member and associated states of the European Union (n = 23,934) served as the database for a cross-sectional analysis. The sample was collected via face-to-face interviews in the year 2005. The association of the risks of occupational accidents, health impairments, and decreases in work-life balance with working Sundays was calculated using logistic regression models, controlling for potential confounders, such as shiftwork, workload, and demographic characteristics. The results indicated that working one or more Sundays/month was associated with increase both in the risk of reporting one or more health impairments (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.29) and poorer work-life balance (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.28). These effects remained after controlling for potentially confounding factors, such as other work schedule attributes, intensity of physical and mental workload, and individual characteristics. Furthermore, working Sundays was also related to increased risk of occupational accidents within the last year (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.73). Controlling again for individual, workload, and working-time characteristics, a significant association with accident risk, however, remained only in work sectors with low a priori risk of occupational accidents (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02-1.91), although the increased risk could be observed for both medium and high a priori risk sectors working Sundays (without controlling for additional confounders). The results thus indicate that the detrimental effects of working Sundays on safety, health, and social well-being should be taken into account when designing work schedules. The potential hazards to employees' safety, health, and work-life balance, in particular, should be considered in discussions concerning extending work on Sundays in certain sectors, e.g., retail."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "In August 2023, a tragic case in Kobe City, Japan, highlighted the severe working conditions faced by resident physicians. A resident specialising in internal medicine died by suicide after experiencing extraordinary workloads, including 236 h of overtime in the month before his death. This case underscores the broader systemic issue of excessive working hours in Japan's medical profession, exacerbated by the country's 'passion pay' culture, which exploits young physicians' dedication. Surveys indicate that 28% of residents experience burnout, with long hours, inefficient task allocation and poor workplace communication as key stressors. Addressing excessive workloads requires restructuring physician responsibilities. Research shows that full-time physicians under 50 spend significant time on non-medical tasks that could be delegated to other professionals. The primary physician model, which holds doctors responsible for patients beyond their shifts, further extends work hours. Transitioning to a time-based task allocation system and implementing task-shifting strategies could alleviate these burdens. Workplace communication also requires improvement. Limited supervisory support and hierarchical barriers prevent open discussions about well-being. We underscore that drawing insights from corporate strategies, such as Marui Group's task optimisation policies and TOYOTA's anonymous feedback system, hospitals could implement structured well-being initiatives for physicians. Physician well-being directly correlates with patient satisfaction and treatment adherence. Addressing burnout through workload reduction and improved communication is essential for maintaining both doctor and patient health. Hospitals must prioritise physician well-being alongside patient care, fostering a sustainable working environment for medical professionals."

        "abstract": "Fatigue is a state of difficulty maintaining voluntary activity. Cortisol, which is essential for stress regulation, can cause tissue damage when elevated for long periods of time, which is a common problem for office workers in stressful environments. Sleep quality is important for health and cognitive function, while sleep deprivation increases the risk of physical and mental health disorders. Gyrokinesis combines circular, spiral, and wave movements influenced by yoga, tai chi, and ballet to provide a calming effect on the sympathetic nervous system. This study investigated the effects of Gyrokinesis exercise on lower extremity edema, muscle strength, fatigue, and sleep quality in sedentary office workers. Twenty-seven adult women aged 20-40 years were randomly assigned to a Gyrokinesis exercise group (n=14) or a control group (n=13). The exercise group participated in 60-min Gyrokinesis sessions twice a week for 8 weeks, while the control group used elastic compression stockings during their working hours. Results showed a significant decrease in fatigue and an improvement in sleep quality in the exercise group. Cortisol and serotonin levels showed a significant between-group interaction effect, with within-group changes observed only in the exercise group. Sleep quality indices improved significantly over time. In conclusion, Gyrokinesis exercise has the potential to improve physical and psychological well-being in sedentary office workers by positively influencing fatigue, sleep quality, and related hormone levels."

This scoping review aimed to synthesize evidence from published and grey literature on workplace mental health promotion interventions targeting African healthcare workers using Social Ecological Model (SEM) and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model as an underlying theoretical framework for analysis. Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews was used. The search was conducted across multiple databases. A total of 5590 results were retrieved from Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science. Seventeen (17) studies from ten (10) African countries were included after title, abstract and full text screening. Thematic analysis identified 5 key themes namely training programs, counselling services, peer support programs, relaxation techniques and informational resources. In conclusion, even though limited workplace mental health interventions for healthcare professionals were identified in Africa, individual-level interventions have been notably substantial in comparison to organizational and policy-level initiatives. Moving forward, a multi-faceted approach unique to the African context is essential."

Weekly working hours and SRH were the primary variables, with equivalized household income levels classified into quartiles. A generalised estimating equation was used to assess the relationship between long working hours and poor SRH, adjusted for demographic and health-related factors. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on household income level and satisfaction. Long working hours were generally associated with poor SRH (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) in unadjusted model, particularly among higher-income groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.01 for Q4) after adjustment for covariates. However, no significant association was found for lower-income groups. When stratified by income satisfaction, longer working hours were significantly associated with poor SRH only in income-satisfied individuals among higher-income group. The health effects of long working hours may differ according to household income levels and satisfaction. Policy interventions should consider both work hour reductions and income adequacy to improve worker health."

        "abstract": "In western China, many socioeconomically disadvantaged rural children remain at preschools for extremely long hours: they start to receive boarding services as young as 3 years old and remain at preschools for 4 to 5 consecutive days weekly. Although the quality of childcare is generally poor in these preschools, extremely long school hours and prolonged separation from primary caregivers may induce additional stress and lead to school maladjustment among boarding preschoolers. This study examines the impact of boarding experience on preschool beginners' social adjustment and stress responses, as indicated by their saliva alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol. A total of over 900 saliva samples of 31 boarding and 30 non-boarding preschoolers (mean age = 44.0 months, SD = 9.8 months) were collected over 12 weeks after they entered preschools. Primary caregivers reported children's behavioural problems and school refusal. Boarders experienced a larger mid-morning to mid-afternoon rise in cortisol than non-boarders on the second-to-last weekdays but not on the first weekdays. Non-boarders experienced an accelerated decrease in sAA during the 12 weeks, whereas boarders did not. Differences in cortisol and sAA patterns indicate potential increased stress for boarders, which might be associated with their more prevalent school-refusal behaviour than non-boarders. The findings underscore that entry into boarding preschool may cause stress and school refusal in rural Chinese children during their transition to preschool. Additional contacts with primary caregivers during this transition are needed to support boarders emotionally."

This study reports on a survey of 1,768 current and former students in U.K. higher education carried out in 2018, of whom 734 had experienced at least one incident of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct was measured by questions on sexual conduct from faculty/staff that aimed to establish whether a sexualized environment existed rather than asking whether behaviors were unwanted. Within this sample, 734 had experienced a sexualized environment from faculty/staff. They were asked to self-assess the impacts this had on them, and 34% reported that they had been negatively impacted by this conduct. The most common impacts were loss of self-confidence; mental health problems; professional relations being damaged; loss of confidence in academic work; and avoiding parts of campus, each experienced by 14% to 18% of this sample. Items that measured academic disengagement such as missing contact hours or dropping/changing a module were also impactful for a minority of respondents, in line with existing literature. The article discusses two impacts that are underexplored in previous research on sexual misconduct in academia: the ability to network; and self-confidence. First, our study indicates that there are significant impacts of sexual misconduct on students' ability to network and build professional relationships. However, existing studies on this topic have not discussed sexual misconduct as a barrier to networking. Second, the study reveals that, among this sample, loss of confidence was the most common impact of being subjected to sexual misconduct. This supports Gill and Orgad's theorization of the \"confidence culture,\" a trend among popular and corporate gender equality discourses that exhorts women to develop their confidence, obscuring the structural reasons for women's lower confidence; our findings show that sexual misconduct is one of these reasons."

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of preoperative clinical and biochemical factors in predicting difficult thyroidectomy (DT) and its influence on complications. Methodology Fifty-two patients were enrolled in the study, all of whom underwent total or hemithyroidectomy. Preoperative clinical parameters, including large goiter, presence of compressive neck symptoms, retrosternal extension, duration of goiter, and presence of toxic symptoms, were noted. Biochemical tests, including thyroid function tests and thyroglobulin levels, were performed preoperatively. Intraoperative difficulty in thyroidectomy was assessed using the thyroidectomy difficulty scale (TDS). The correlation between complications and TDS was evaluated. Results Preoperative clinical features like the presence of compressive neck symptoms (p=0.003), the presence of a large goiter (p=0.0004), the presence of retrosternal extension (p=0.014), and the long duration of goiter (p=0.0003) were significantly associated with DT. Biochemical features like raised serum thyroglobulin levels were significantly associated with DT (p=0.0004). There was a linear relationship between operating times and TDS scores with higher TDS scores associated with longer operating times. Postoperatively, median serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were found to be significantly lower in the DT group at 48 hours postoperatively (p=0.019). Vocal cord palsy was found to be statistically significant (P-value: 0.0013) in the DT group. Discussion and conclusions The TDS and longer operating times were used to categorize DTs. Preoperative clinical features can help the surgeon predict whether thyroid surgery will be classified as a DT and alert them to the potential for postoperative complications in this patient group."

Such fitness-to-work determination should include individualized consideration of the nature of the headache disorder itself, the pattern of the headache, the impact of sleep deprivation on the headache as it relates to fitness to do shiftwork, medication and substance side effects, fitness-to-work implications of associated medical or psychiatric conditions, and the potential of symptom feigning or malingering for secondary gain. As clinicians often struggle with fitness-to-work determinations, a structured approach to fitness-to-work assessments in headache conditions and other pain conditions would improve clarity for clinicians and increase the quality of care provided to patients, with potential benefits for workplace safety and policy in this arena as well."

Genetic-behavior interaction studies have focused on Western populations, overlooking South Asians. We included 306 overweight/obese and 306 normal-weight controls, matched for age and gender. Anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and body fat percentage) were taken using standard procedures while behavioral data (dietary and sleep-related behaviors, shiftwork, and physical activity) was collected by questionnaire. Genotyping was performed by Taqman assays. Data was analyzed using SPSS 19.0. Rank-based inverse normal transformation was executed for quantitative non-normal variables. The linear regression revealed that both Clock gene variants interacted significantly with dietary and sleep-related behaviors and low physical activity, impacting adiposity measures regardless of age and gender. Shiftwork interacted specifically with rs6843722, increasing body fat percentage. This study indicates that Clock gene variants, when interacting with lifestyle factors, play a substantial role in increasing obesity risk highlighting the link between lifestyle choices and disturbances in circadian rhythms controlled by Clock gene variations, ultimately leading to obesity."

This study aims to provide a comprehensive summary of data regarding shiftwork and its impact on the cardiovascular system from the last decade. It explores the association of shift schedules with multiple aspects of cardiovascular disease and the physiological processes that lead up to it. It also identifies gaps in current knowledge regarding the topic. Two hundred and sixty-eight articles were gathered from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct using relevant medical subject headings (MeSH) strategy and advanced search using keywords including 'Shift work,' 'Night shift,' 'Occupational health,' 'Circadian rhythm,' 'Cardiovascular disease,' 'Cardiovascular health.' The search was conducted in April and completed in May 2023. Systemic reviews, meta-analysis, cohort and cross-sectional studies from the last 10 years were included, and assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR), Newcastle Ottawa, and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools were used, respectively, for quality assessment. A total of 14 articles were included in our review, including five systematic reviews and meta-analyses, six prospective cohort studies, and three cross-sectional studies. Each study reported a significant association between shift work with some aspect of cardiovascular disease. An increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome is reported. Circadian disruption, unhealthy diet, and emotional and physiological stress contribute to these effects. Oxidative damage and inflammatory biomarkers appear to play a role in this process, but more research is warranted for a deeper understanding of these changes. Despite an abundance of evidence pointing towards the short-term and long-term harm to shift workers' cardiovascular health, there is limited research regarding the policies that are needed to better monitor cardiovascular damage in employees. The focus needs to shift toward prevention-based policies and their efficacy in workplace settings."

A diverse cohort of 387 participants, spanning doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and laboratory technicians or scientists, formed the research base, with the majority being women (67.7%), with a mean age of 34.67 years. Professionals self-reported their predominant schedules to gauge work patterns, classifying them as day or night shifts. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) tool assessed the quality of life across the physical, psychological, social relationship, and environmental domains. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS), and perceived social support was evaluated via the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A cross-sectional design was adopted, and the study employed moderated mediation analysis using SmartPLS 4.0. The results underscored the significant ramifications of night shifts on environmental and physical well-being. Psychological health and social relationships were better among day shift than night shift workers. There was a pronounced correlation between night shifts and heightened levels of anxiety, stress, and depression. The mediating role of psychological distress and the moderating influence of social support in these relationships were evident. This study offers invaluable insights into the role of work schedules in shaping the well-being of healthcare professionals, emphasising the protective role of social support and the unique challenges faced by migrant health workers."

Two safe, wake-promoting countermeasures, caffeine and blue-enriched white light have been studied on Earth and are available on the International Space Station. We therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial examining the impact of regularly timed low-dose caffeine (0.3 mg per kg per h) and moderate illuminance blue-enriched white light (~90 lux, ~88 melEDI lux, 6300 K) as countermeasures, separately and combined, in a multi-night simulation of sleep-wake shifts experienced during spaceflight among 16 participants (7 F, ages 26-55). We find that chronic administration of low-dose caffeine improves subjective and objective correlates of alertness and performance during an overnight work schedule involving chronic sleep loss and circadian misalignment, although we also find that caffeine disrupts subsequent sleep. We further find that 90 lux of blue-enriched light moderately reduces electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the theta and delta regions, which are associated with sleepiness. These findings support the use of low-dose caffeine and potentially blue-enriched white light to enhance alertness and performance among astronauts and shiftworking populations."

In study 2, 32 partially sleep-deprived participants completed a dayshift. These studies found that performance differed between the type of task and the type of simulated shift where performance during the nightshift was worse than during the dayshift. In addition, collapsing speed and accuracy on the math task into inverse efficiency scores provided a unique measure that captured the impact of circadian rhythms during shiftwork. The current study also indicated that participants adopted cognitive strategies including speed-accuracy tradeoff and regulatory foci regarding work motivation (prevention focus and promotion focus) when completing the tasks depending on time-of-day, type of shift, circadian rhythms, and amount of sleep deprivation. This suggests that researchers and organizations should consider cognitive strategies in addition to the physiological components of sleep deprivation and circadian rhythms when investigating and documenting the impact of time-of-day due to different types of shiftwork conditions on performance and safety."

For the in-phase group, food intake is significantly greater during the rats' active period compared to their inactive period; a feeding pattern similar to adrenal-intact control rats. In contrast, the feeding pattern of the out-of-phase group is significantly dysregulated. Consistent with a direct hypothalamic modulation of feeding behaviour, this altered timing is accompanied by dysregulated timing of anorexigenic and orexigenic neuropeptide gene expression. For Neuropeptide Y (Npy), we report a glucocorticoid-dependent direct transcriptional regulation mechanism mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Taken together, our data highlight the adverse behavioural outcomes that can arise when two circadian systems have anti-phasic cues, in this case impacting on the glucocorticoid-regulation of a process as fundamental to health as feeding behaviour. Our findings further highlight the need for development of rational approaches in the prevention of metabolic dysfunction in circadian-disrupting activities such as transmeridian travel and shift-work."

        "data": "2024",
        "abstract": "This systematic review examines moderators and mediators tested in evaluations of stress management interventions for hospital employees to determine their significance for intervention outcomes. To be included, studies had to comprise a moderator or mediator analysis and a quantitative assessment of stress or mental well-being, and to be published in English or German language. Five databases (APA PsycInfo, APA PsycArticles, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science) were searched. Moderators and mediators were categorised thematically and examined using effect direction plots. Study quality was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I. In fifteen included studies, 22 moderators and ten mediators were identified. Moderators and mediators were categorised into individual psychological factors (14), socio-economic status (6), work situation (5), intervention (3), and duration of employment (3). Two moderators (perceived stressfulness of residency, job control) had a positive, two a negative impact (spirituality, socially desirable responding). One moderator (years of professional experience) had a positive and negative impact. Three moderators measured on categorical scales (gender, profession, and shiftwork) also had effects, favouring women, physicians and night-shift employees. Five mediators (adherence to intervention, mindfulness, non-reactivity to inner experience, total observing, and self-compassion) had a positive impact, while three (isolation, over-identification, psychological inflexibility) had a negative impact. In conclusion, effects of interventions were predominantly driven by individual psychological factors, while the role of other variables seems to be limited. Interventions focussing on primary or tertiary prevention were rare. Also processes through which organisational-level interventions can be most effective have been hardly investigated. Larger and methodologically robust studies are needed to better understand causal pathways and optimise matching of interventions to target groups."

Yet, how it is affected by environmental-circadian disruption (ECD) such as shiftwork and jetlag, which impact millions of people worldwide, are ill-defined. Here, we provided the first comprehensive description of liver circadian gene expression under normal and after ECD conditions. We found that post-transcription and post-translation processes are dominant contributors to whole-cell or nuclear circadian proteome, respectively. Furthermore, rhythmicity of 64% transcriptome, 98% whole-cell proteome and 95% nuclear proteome is re-written by ECD. The re-writing, which is associated with changes of circadian cis-regulatory elements, RNA-processing and protein trafficking, diminishes circadian regulation of fat and carbohydrate metabolism and persists after one week of ECD-recovery."

Weekly working hours and SRH were the primary variables, with equivalized household income levels classified into quartiles. A generalised estimating equation was used to assess the relationship between long working hours and poor SRH, adjusted for demographic and health-related factors. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on household income level and satisfaction. Long working hours were generally associated with poor SRH (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) in unadjusted model, particularly among higher-income groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.01 for Q4) after adjustment for covariates. However, no significant association was found for lower-income groups. When stratified by income satisfaction, longer working hours were significantly associated with poor SRH only in income-satisfied individuals among higher-income group. The health effects of long working hours may differ according to household income levels and satisfaction. Policy interventions should consider both work hour reductions and income adequacy to improve worker health."

        "abstract": "In western China, many socioeconomically disadvantaged rural children remain at preschools for extremely long hours: they start to receive boarding services as young as 3 years old and remain at preschools for 4 to 5 consecutive days weekly. Although the quality of childcare is generally poor in these preschools, extremely long school hours and prolonged separation from primary caregivers may induce additional stress and lead to school maladjustment among boarding preschoolers. This study examines the impact of boarding experience on preschool beginners' social adjustment and stress responses, as indicated by their saliva alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol. A total of over 900 saliva samples of 31 boarding and 30 non-boarding preschoolers (mean age = 44.0 months, SD = 9.8 months) were collected over 12 weeks after they entered preschools. Primary caregivers reported children's behavioural problems and school refusal. Boarders experienced a larger mid-morning to mid-afternoon rise in cortisol than non-boarders on the second-to-last weekdays but not on the first weekdays. Non-boarders experienced an accelerated decrease in sAA during the 12 weeks, whereas boarders did not. Differences in cortisol and sAA patterns indicate potential increased stress for boarders, which might be associated with their more prevalent school-refusal behaviour than non-boarders. The findings underscore that entry into boarding preschool may cause stress and school refusal in rural Chinese children during their transition to preschool. Additional contacts with primary caregivers during this transition are needed to support boarders emotionally."

This study reports on a survey of 1,768 current and former students in U.K. higher education carried out in 2018, of whom 734 had experienced at least one incident of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct was measured by questions on sexual conduct from faculty/staff that aimed to establish whether a sexualized environment existed rather than asking whether behaviors were unwanted. Within this sample, 734 had experienced a sexualized environment from faculty/staff. They were asked to self-assess the impacts this had on them, and 34% reported that they had been negatively impacted by this conduct. The most common impacts were loss of self-confidence; mental health problems; professional relations being damaged; loss of confidence in academic work; and avoiding parts of campus, each experienced by 14% to 18% of this sample. Items that measured academic disengagement such as missing contact hours or dropping/changing a module were also impactful for a minority of respondents, in line with existing literature. The article discusses two impacts that are underexplored in previous research on sexual misconduct in academia: the ability to network; and self-confidence. First, our study indicates that there are significant impacts of sexual misconduct on students' ability to network and build professional relationships. However, existing studies on this topic have not discussed sexual misconduct as a barrier to networking. Second, the study reveals that, among this sample, loss of confidence was the most common impact of being subjected to sexual misconduct. This supports Gill and Orgad's theorization of the \"confidence culture,\" a trend among popular and corporate gender equality discourses that exhorts women to develop their confidence, obscuring the structural reasons for women's lower confidence; our findings show that sexual misconduct is one of these reasons."

        "abstract": "Movement is energetically costly, requiring muscle activity to support and propel the animal as it walks, runs, climbs, swims or flies. In this Review, I examine the metabolic impact of locomotion over different timescales. During locomotion, whole-body energy expenditure can rise by more than an order of magnitude above resting, and these costs arise from activating muscle to exert force as well as the work that muscles perform. Over hours or days, locomotion can dominate daily energy expenditure (i.e. field metabolic rate), particularly when provisioning young, migrating, or during other periods of intense activity. The relationship between muscle force and metabolic cost means that locomotor costs and daily expenditures can be tracked using wearable accelerometers. Over longer timescales, however, the relationship between locomotion and daily expenditure becomes more tenuous. Compensatory trade-offs with other physiological activity, including thermoregulation, growth, maintenance and reproduction, obscure the relationship between daily locomotor activity and daily energy expenditure. Over evolutionary timeframes, variation in daily locomotor activity does not predict variation in daily expenditure. The apparent trade-offs between locomotor expenditure and other physiological tasks suggests that, over long timescales, the cost of locomotion might be best measured by its effects on other systems. The impact of locomotion on growth, reproduction and maintenance should be incorporated into ecological and evolutionary assessments of the costs of movement."

Refractory VT, characterized by recurrent episodes requiring intervention, poses unique challenges for management, necessitating advanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This systematic review evaluates the impact of imaging and pharmacological treatments in managing refractory VT in critically ill patients. A systematic literature search was conducted using keywords such as \"refractory ventricular tachycardia\", \"critical illness\", \"imaging techniques\", \"pharmacological treatments\", \"antiarrhythmic drugs\", \"ICD interventions\", and \"non-invasive therapy\". Databases searched included PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library, identifying 1590 publications. After screening, 11 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. Oral procainamide significantly reduced VT episodes but caused severe side effects in certain patients. Noninvasive interventions such as transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TcMS) and noninvasive electrophysiology-guided radioablation reduced VT burden and antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use, with TcMS decreasing VT episodes in the sham group (P < 0.001). Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic arrhythmia radiotherapy (STAR) reduced VT episodes. Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion blockade decreased VT episodes (P < 0.001) within 24 hours. Catheter ablation improved composite outcomes, including ICD shocks and heart failure hospitalizations, compared to AAD therapy. Quality of life significantly improved with noninvasive therapies, though SBRT presented rare complications like pneumonitis. Imaging and pharmacological interventions effectively reduce VT burden and ICD interventions while showing varying safety profiles. However, the limited sample sizes, short follow-up durations, and heterogeneity across studies highlight the need for further high-quality research to establish long-term efficacy and safety."

To augment long-term extinction retention, the temporal distribution of extinction learning sessions is critical. This study investigated the effects of massed and spaced training (with short and long intervals) on extinction retention compared to a classic protocol. 120 healthy participants were recruited and randomly divided to massed training, spaced training with 20-minutes or 3-hours intervals, and a control group. The control group completed half the number of extinction trials compared to the other groups. The fear conditioning/extinction paradigm consisted of three consecutive days of fear acquisition, extinction, and recall, followed by a second recall one week later. Skin conductance response (SCR) and self-rating questionnaires (ratings of valence, arousal, and fear) were recorded and analyzed using mixed model ANOVAs. The results revealed that during the extinction phase, both massed and spaced protocols showed significantly lower SCRs compared to the control group, with massed training resulting in the largest effects. In the second recall, only the massed extinction group showed no significant difference in SCRs between threat and safety cues. The self-report assessments indicated that the massed extinction group showed furthermore lower arousal than the control group in the first recall. These results suggest that both massed and spaced training promote fear extinction learning, but only massed training improves long-term extinction retention. This study highlights the impact of the temporal distribution and trial number of extinction learning on extinction retention, offering insights for future research on improving fear extinction efficacy."

        "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke, a medical emergency caused by reduced cerebral blood flow, results in brain cell damage. While commonly associated with older individuals, strokes can also occur in young and middle-aged adults, posing significant socio-economic and health challenges due to the long-term impact of the condition. This poses significant socio-economic and health challenges because stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality. A carotid web (CaW), a rare form of fibromuscular dysplasia, is increasingly recognized as a cause of cryptogenic stroke in young adults. Characterized by a fibrous intimal flap in the internal carotid artery, a CaW disrupts blood flow, promoting thrombosis and increasing stroke risk. I am a 46-year-old pediatrician with no significant medical history who experienced an ischemic stroke due to a CaW. The onset occurred during a morning jog when I experienced nausea, malaise, and unsteady movement. Although I exhibited no headache or paralysis, my wife observed slurred speech, prompting emergency consultation three hours after onset. Imaging revealed ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory. I underwent thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, with good recovery except for mild aphasia. Pathological examination confirmed a CaW in the left carotid artery, with myxoid intimal changes and fibroblast proliferation. While the initial ultrasound (US) failed to detect a CaW, subsequent detailed US identified the lesion. Routine magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) also missed the CaW, highlighting its limitations in detecting such abnormalities. Diagnostic modalities like digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are effective but invasive. Non-invasive alternatives, such as US and MRA, are limited by operator dependency and technical constraints. For instance, B-mode US in experienced hands can detect CaWs in longitudinal views, but its diagnostic accuracy is lower than that of CTA and DSA. Advanced imaging, such as contrast-enhanced US and 3D MRA, offers potential improvements but is not yet standard practice. In my case, CTA provided a definitive diagnosis, while initial US and MRA missed smaller lesions. My recovery included intensive rehabilitation to address residual aphasia. Although I resumed professional duties within three months, minor symptoms, such as mild numbness and occasional speech difficulty, persist. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of CaWs, particularly pre-stroke. Further research is needed to improve non-invasive detection methods and understand the pathogenesis of CaWs in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis and prevention."

        "data": "2024",
        "abstract": "Background Heart failure (HF) is commonly managed by addressing water and sodium (Na) balance, with arterial circulation playing a major role in influencing renal Na and water excretion. Recently, chloride (Cl) has been recognized as an important factor in HF, associated with volume regulation and its modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity through macula densa signaling, which impacts Na retention and neurohormonal activation. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, can enhance decongestion in HF by increasing urinary Na and Cl excretion when added to loop diuretics, a mechanism supported by prior studies demonstrating improved urine output and decongestion. Objective This study investigates the neurohormonal effects of acetazolamide in acute HF, focusing on its ability to enhance decongestion, reduce neurohormonal activation (e.g., renin and aldosterone), and modulate RAAS markers. Methods In this prospective, single-center observational study, 80 patients with acute HF were enrolled and divided into two groups: a case group (n=40) receiving acetazolamide with standard therapy and a control group (n=40) on standard therapy alone. Patients were matched based on clinical characteristics to reduce selection bias. Baseline characteristics, neurohormonal profiles, including plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone, electrolyte levels, and clinical outcomes were compared. Results The acetazolamide group exhibited higher urinary Cl excretion (108.9±25.3 mEq/L vs. 79.2±22.7 mEq/L; p<0.001) and reduced PRA and aldosterone levels (1.3±0.4 ng/mL/h and 88±21 pg/mL) compared to controls (1.7±0.6 ng/mL/h and 128±29 pg/mL; p=0.002 and p=0.006, respectively). These reductions in PRA and aldosterone are significant as they correlate with improved volume status and reduced neurohormonal stress, which are critical components in HF management. Improved clinical outcomes included a greater percentage of patients becoming symptom-free within 72 hours (77.5% vs. 52.5%; p=0.018) and shorter hospitalization (5.6±1.4 days vs. 7.1±1.7 days; p=0.028). Conclusion Acetazolamide in addition to standard therapy enhances decongestion and reduces neurohormonal activation in acute HF, suggesting its dual benefit in fluid management and neurohormonal modulation. Further research is needed to confirm these benefits, assess long-term effects, and overcome limitations, including the study's single-center observational design."

For bacterial communities, TWPs addition changed their composition in the water, but only little in the sediment. For fungal communities, TWPs addition changed their composition both in water and sediments. Furthermore, in water, TWPs addition increased network complexity between bacteria-bacteria, fungi-fungi and bacteria-fungi in the urban system but reduced it in the rural one. In contrast, TWPs presence did not significantly change network complexity among microbial communities in the sediment of both lakes. Isotope labeling analysis uncovered that based on a short-term (6 hours) incubation experiment, TWPs addition did not significantly change carbon nor nitrogen cycling in the water. Yet, certain changes could be observed, especially in the long-term experiment (1 month), indicating that TWPs pollution has the potential to impact elemental cycling and thus ecosystem functions by altering microbial communities. Our results provide new insights into TWPs-induced ecological effects on microorganisms and potential biogeochemical consequences in a rural vs. urban lakes."

        "abstract": "The imperative to improve the well-being of graduate medical education (GME) trainees has been well documented. While existing interventions have largely centered on increasing individual trainee resilience, less focus has been on the role of national health policy, economics, and the overall U.S. care delivery system in acting as antecedent contributors to burnout among learners. To explore the impact of these national system level factors, Princeton University hosted the Systems Summit on Clinical Wellbeing in October 2023. Co-sponsored by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, American Medical Association, and Healing Works Foundation, the event brought together thought leaders, policymakers, and experts from a myriad of backgrounds, including GME leaders and trainees.Through a systems lens, summit attendees identified opportunities and barriers for well-being at both the national and health care organization levels. At the national level, identified barriers included historical national policy decisions, longstanding economic pressures in health care, and their combined cumulative impact on trainees. At the health care organization level, trainees pointed to an incongruity between common institutional wellness offerings and their more immediate support needs, along with unsustainable workload expectations, including the added toll of non-physician tasks (e.g., scheduling). A lack of appropriate tools for assessing well-being through a systems lens further compounds these issues. More actionable outputs may be achievable through the integration of operationally oriented well-being metrics (e.g., clinical and academic workload hours, call frequency, stay intent).Long overdue updates to ill-fated national policy decisions, along with a redirection of the focus of GME well-being efforts at the programmatic level, could, in combination, fundamentally reshape the experience of trainees, contributing to lower incidences of depression, exhaustion, and burnout."

Many of these tasks do not require HPC function in the anterograde direction suggesting that, in the intact brain, the HPC is actively involved during all forms of learning. However, prior work has also demonstrated double dissociations of HPC and amygdala function, which is inconsistent with this view. Here, we aim to understand this discrepancy by assessing the effects of neurotoxic lesions of the HPC on anterograde and retrograde amnesia for conditioned place preference (CPP). This task is dependent on a network centered on the basolateral amygdala and not the HPC. The results show that extensive HPC damage had no impact on the acquisition or expression of CPP. One explanation for this result is that the task requires multiple, distributed training sessions for conditioning to emerge, and it has been proposed that this parameter may eliminate the need for HPC to support memory. To test this, we completed experiments to probe place learning in the Morris water task, which is thought to always require HPC function, but implemented an over-training procedure before HPC damage. We found that rats were severely impaired suggesting that this task parameter does not always allow non-HPC networks to support learning. Finally, an experiment was designed to test whether memories acquired by distinct memory networks on the same days, within hours of one another, would be linked in HPC. The results showed that they remained independent of one another."

While these platforms offer numerous benefits, including communication, information sharing, and social connection, they have also been linked to a range of negative psychological consequences, including body image dissatisfaction. This study examined the prevalence of body dissatisfaction among health science students in Saudi Arabia, assessed the frequency and duration of social media use by gender, estimated the impact of social media use for >3 hours a day on body dissatisfaction, and identified the most commonly used social media platforms. Methodology Between December 2023 and June 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional study of students at King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, including all university colleges and branches in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Al-Ahsa. A survey was randomly sent to students' email addresses by the research unit of each college. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to test the association between two categorical variables. Results The 392 participants were between 18 and 25 years old; more than half (63%) were female and 95% were single. The majority (88%) were satisfied with their body image, whereas 11.2% were dissatisfied. Body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with gender (p = 0.038) and body mass index (p = 0.031). Approximately 87% reported spending ≤3 hours per day on social media, and 65% reported using social media six times or more. There were no associations between long duration and frequency of social media use and body dissatisfaction by gender (p > 0.05). The most prevalent social media platform was TikTok (63%), followed by Twitter (59%), and an equal percentage (53%) for WhatsApp, Instagram, and Snapchat. Conclusions This study indicates a low prevalence of body dissatisfaction among health science students. Increased duration and frequency of social media use were not significantly associated with body dissatisfaction. Focusing on body satisfaction among future physicians is crucial because it plays a significant role in shaping their patients' perceptions of health and beauty. Future studies could expand on these findings by including larger and more diverse sample sizes. They could also explore the impact of different types of social media content on body dissatisfaction."

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, continues to pose severe risks to public health and economic stability in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in developing nations like Bangladesh. The necessity for advanced forecasting mechanisms has never been more critical to enhance the effectiveness of vector control strategies and resource allocations. This study formulates a dynamic data pipeline to forecast dengue incidence based on 13 meteorological variables using a suite of state-of-the-art machine learning models and custom features engineering, achieving an accuracy of 84.02%, marking a substantial improvement over existing studies. A novel wrapper feature selection algorithm employing a custom objective function is proposed in this study, which significantly improves model accuracy by 12.63% and reduces the mean absolute percentage error by 70.82%. The custom objective function's output can be transformed to quantify the contribution of each variable to the target variable's variability, providing deeper insights into the workings of black box models. The study concludes that relative humidity is redundant in predicting dengue infection, while meteorological factors exhibit more significant short-term impacts compared to long-term and immediate impacts. Sunshine (hours) emerges as the meteorological factor with the most immediate impact, whereas precipitation is the most impactful predictor over both short-term (8-month lag) and long-term (26-30-month lag) periods. Forecasts for 2024 using the best-performing model predict a rise in dengue cases starting in May, peaking at 24,000 cases per month by August and persisting at high levels through October before declining to half by year-end. These findings offer critical insights into temporal climate effects on dengue transmission, aiding the development of effective forecasting systems."

Conjugation at 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 protein-to-pectin ratios significantly improved structural flexibility, physicochemical characteristics, and functional properties. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed successful conjugation through shifts in amide I and II bands, while SDS-PAGE revealed higher molecular weight aggregates, indicating effective crosslinking. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed a reduction in β-sheet content (from 47.41 % to 16.15 %) and an increase in α-helices (from 0 % to 12.70 %), enhancing solubility (from 1.79 % to 100 %) and reducing surface hydrophobicity (from 74.52 % to 18.16 %). These structural changes facilitated improved protein dispersion and stable gel network formation, enhancing gel cohesiveness and softness, key attributes for dysphagia-friendly textures. Conjugate-incorporated gels exhibited softer textures than firmer control gels. Acid-induced gels formed soft, easily deformable matrices, while heat-induced gels produced firmer structures, accommodating different dysphagia severity levels. International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) assessments classified these gels as Level 6, ensuring safe swallowing. Rheological analyses revealed non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior, while SAXS confirmed uniform nano-aggregation. Overall, PPI-HM pectin conjugates demonstrate potential as safe, functional solutions for texture-modified foods targeting dysphagia management."

This study employed metagenomic sequencing to investigate the dynamic response and recovery processes of soil bacterial communities and ARGs after the end of fumigation with Dazomet. The results revealed that the effects of Dazomet were both phased and recoverable. Initially, no significant shifts in bacterial community diversity were observed; however, by day 10 of recovery (Dazomet10), diversity had decreased by 3.1%. By contrast, ARG levels surged by 17.3% and 10.9% on days 10 and 20 (Dazomet20), respectively, before reverting to the baseline by day 50 (Dazomet50). These patterns were corroborated by qPCR data, which showed a 90.8% reduction in 16S rRNA gene abundance, alongside a 4.17- to 4.38-fold increase in the relative abundance of ARGs at Dazomet10 and Dazomet20. Approximately 63% of the variation in ARGs was attributed to bacterial community composition and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Combined with community analysis and host-tracking analysis, it was found that Streptomyces and Nocardioides were identified as key ARGs hosts. Overall, the microbial communities and resistome required at least 50 days after the end of fumigation to recover to their pre-fumigation state. This study sheds light on the dynamic interactions between bacterial communities and ARGs during recovery from Dazomet fumigation and underscores the critical need for the rational use of fumigants in agricultural practices."

        "abstract": "Species delimitation in plants is sometimes challenging due to morphological convergence, interspecific gene flow, and historically limited sampling. Bredia Blume as currently defined comprises 27 species and has been resolved as monophyletic in previous phylogenomic studies. However, relationships among several major lineages in the genus remain elusive, and the species boundaries of some problematic taxa have not been tested. In this study, we employed comprehensive taxon sampling and reconstructed the phylogeny of Bredia using single-copy orthologs (SCOs), genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and whole plastomes. The species tree derived from SCOs provided the highest resolution, strongly supporting all interspecific relationships. We identified instances of morphological convergence and potential hybridization/introgression within groups of interest and discussed species limits based on monophyly, genetic divergence, and morphological diagnosability. Using this robust phylogeny, we inferred divergence times and biogeographical history for Bredia. The genus originated in the Yunnan-Myanmar-Thailand Border region and the Beibu Gulf region during the middle Miocene, initially adapting to karst habitats. Over time, certain lineages shifted to non-karst environments. One such lineage migrated to the southeastern part of the Eastern Asiatic Kingdom in the late Miocene, where it rapidly diversified forming several major lineages. Subsequently, a mainland lineage reached Taiwan via a land bridge between the late Pliocene and the early Pleistocene and diversified in the region, eventually spreading to the Ryukyu Islands in the middle Pleistocene."

In the present study, a renewable TC (RTC) composed of alizarin, myristyl myristate, and 1-hexadecanol was synthesized, demonstrating a color shift between orange and orange-red during phase transitions. To maintain the shape stability, the RTC was encapsulated within a wood-based cellulose/sodium methylsilicate framework, termed thermochromic wood composite-smart material (TWC-SM). This framework altered the chemical structure of alizarin, resulting in a color shift between greyish-purple (L: 26 ± 1, a: 4 ± 1, b: -6 ± 1) and deep-purple (L: 14 ± 2, a: 1 ± 1, b: -3 ± 1) for TWC-SM during phase changes, indicating a distinct thermochromic mechanism compared to RTC. Specifically, TWC-SM appears greyish-purple below 52 °C, where the benzene ring of alizarin features two fixed O groups and an additional -OH group. At temperatures above 70 °C, it turns deep-purple as the -OH group loses a hydrogen ion. TWC-SM exerts a pronounced thermochromic effect, conferring temperature-responsive functionality. Moreover, the solid-liquid phase-changing enthalpy of RTC is 186.78 J/g, and the wood-based cellulose/sodium methylsilicate framework ensures the shape stability of RTC within TWC-SM. Consequently, the average temperature of TWC-SM is at least 5.56 °C higher than that of untreated wood over 60 min following identical thermal treatment. This finding shows the potential of the framework for practical applications in temperature-responsive heat storage materials. This study reveals the structure-activity relationship between RTC and the framework within TWC-SM, which is key to the development of practical applications of RTCs."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "As climate change accelerates, understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem phenology in vulnerable regions is crucial for terrestrial environments. This research systematically used remote sensing data to study the dynamic changes in vegetation phenology in the upper and middle Yellow River Basin (UMYRB), examined the effects of environmental shifts on vegetation phenology, and quantified the contributions of different driving factors. The key findings are as follows: (1) As elevation and latitude increase, the start of the growing season (SOGS) is generally delayed, particularly in the northwest and northeast, where it typically occurs between days 140 and 180. The end of the growing season (EOGS) shifts later from west to east, with 86.66 % of the area experiencing EOGS between days 260 and 300. From 1981 to 2016, approximately 61.35 % of the area exhibited a trend of advancing SOGS (-0.09 days/year), while 60.10 % of the area showed a delay in EOGS (0.08 days/year). (2) Both SOGS and EOGS exhibit significant spatial variability influenced by climatic factors, with the primary pre-season impact period ranging from 1 to 4 months. SOGS is typically negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature, whereas EOGS often shows a positive correlation with precipitation and temperature. Temperature and solar radiation are the primary climatic drivers influencing vegetation phenology in the study region. Temperature accounts for 53.57 % of SOGS and 50.73 % of EOGS, advancing them by 0.18 and 0.22 days, respectively. Solar radiation also significantly influences SOGS and EOGS, advancing them by 0.14 and 0.13 days, respectively. While the impact of diurnal temperature range (DTR) and precipitation is less pronounced, DTR is notably important in high-altitude regions. (3) Vegetation phenology varies significantly across various vegetation types. Forests usually experience an earlier SOGS and a later EOGS, while shrubs in high-altitude areas tend to have a delayed SOGS due to a greater diurnal temperature range. The growing season of grasslands and wetlands is more significantly affected by precipitation and temperature, particularly in the eastern and northern regions. Solar radiation significantly impacts the entire growing season in croplands and grasslands in the central and southern regions. Uncertainty in vegetation phenology was assessed through Bootstrap analysis, and the spatial adaptability of climate driving factors was optimized using the ridge regression model. The results indicate that despite certain sources of uncertainty, the analysis demonstrates high accuracy and stability, providing a reliable scientific basis for ecological management and restoration."

Snails received injections of either a low dose (2.5 μg) or a high dose (25 μg) of LPS, and their behavioral and molecular responses were assessed at 2, 6, and 24 h post-injection. With the high dose, snails exhibited a significant increase in homeostatic aerial respiration lasting for at least 24 h, consistent with a sickness-like state induced by the immune challenge. Additionally, we found that when administered 2, 6, or 24 h before operant conditioning training, the high dose of LPS, impaired memory formation. To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the transcriptional effects of the two doses of LPS in the snails' central ring ganglia. Our analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of immune and stress-related genes, including key enzymes involved in the kynurenine pathway (KP), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Metabolomic analysis suggested that the high LPS dose shifted KP metabolism toward the production of neurotoxic metabolites within the ganglia, indicating a LPS-induced neuroinflammatory state. Together, our findings provide valuable insight into the conserved mechanisms of neuroinflammation in this invertebrate model, offering a simplified yet effective tool to further explore the molecular interactions between the immune and central nervous systems."

SEM revealed significant surface erosion on PHBV, indicative of microbial degradation, while PLA exhibited minor and irregular erosion. Culture-based quantification showed higher bacterial colonization on PHBV compared to PLA, suggesting that PHBV provides a more favourable surface for bacterial attachment Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed high bacterial diversity, with 17,781 operational taxonomic units across all samples. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Planctomycetota were the dominant phyla, with the Shannon index consistently exceeding 8, corroborating the bacterial diversity across all materials. Temporal shifts in bacterial community composition were significant, with exposure time explaining 29.8 % of the variation, suggesting biofilm succession as a key factor shaping microbial assemblages. While polymer type had a limited impact on bacterial composition, PHBV biofilms exhibited greater bacterial abundance and diversity compared to PLA. This study highlights PHBV's role in shaping biofilms and its relevance in assessing biodegradable plastics in marine environments. Understanding microbial interactions with bioplastics is crucial for evaluating their environmental impact and degradation dynamics."

        "abstract": "In August 2023, a tragic case in Kobe City, Japan, highlighted the severe working conditions faced by resident physicians. A resident specialising in internal medicine died by suicide after experiencing extraordinary workloads, including 236 h of overtime in the month before his death. This case underscores the broader systemic issue of excessive working hours in Japan's medical profession, exacerbated by the country's 'passion pay' culture, which exploits young physicians' dedication. Surveys indicate that 28% of residents experience burnout, with long hours, inefficient task allocation and poor workplace communication as key stressors. Addressing excessive workloads requires restructuring physician responsibilities. Research shows that full-time physicians under 50 spend significant time on non-medical tasks that could be delegated to other professionals. The primary physician model, which holds doctors responsible for patients beyond their shifts, further extends work hours. Transitioning to a time-based task allocation system and implementing task-shifting strategies could alleviate these burdens. Workplace communication also requires improvement. Limited supervisory support and hierarchical barriers prevent open discussions about well-being. We underscore that drawing insights from corporate strategies, such as Marui Group's task optimisation policies and TOYOTA's anonymous feedback system, hospitals could implement structured well-being initiatives for physicians. Physician well-being directly correlates with patient satisfaction and treatment adherence. Addressing burnout through workload reduction and improved communication is essential for maintaining both doctor and patient health. Hospitals must prioritise physician well-being alongside patient care, fostering a sustainable working environment for medical professionals."

A risk assessment was performed and a preventive health surveillance protocol was implemented, including clinical-instrumental and laboratory tests aimed at the early detection of any sign of CVD. As a result, n = 442 new diagnoses of CVDs were made and the prevalence of CVDs increased from 12 to 16.1%. The higher prevalence was observed in physicians (P = 57.8%; p < 0.0001). The main risk factors for CVDs were age, male sex and family history of CVDs. The analysis of CVDs determinants highlighted an unexpected protective role of shift work (aOR = 0.64; p < 0.0001). Our preventive health surveillance protocol allowed to reveal a high prevalence of undiagnosed CVDs, laying the foundations for future primary prevention and counseling interventions as part of the health promotion and TOTAL WORKER HEALTH programs.

Seasonality did not contribute to differences in the community composition. Cladosporium sp. was dominant among fungi, whereas Aerococcus sp. was dominant among bacteria. The personal air-samples contained potential human pathogens, such as Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp. and Enterobacteriaceae, that encompass strains with the potential to develop drug-resistance. This study provided characterization of the microbial community composition of personal bioaerosol samples and provided evidence for the occurrence of potential human pathogens in contemporary waste sorting plants.

        "abstract": "Metabolic shifts in cancer cells were found to participate in tumorigenesis, especially driving chemotherapeutic resistance. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death induced by excessive accumulations of iron and lipid peroxidation. Susceptibility to ferroptosis can be intrinsically regulated by various cellular metabolic pathways. Therefore, inducing ferroptosis might be a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy. DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X), a critical modulator of RNA metabolism, was identified as an oncogene in breast cancer and also participates in cancer metabolism and chemotherapeutic resistance. However, the molecular regulation of the association between DDX3X and ferroptosis is largely unknown. Herein, we investigated the correlation between resistance to ferroptosis and DDX3X expression in breast cancer cells. We found that elevation of DDX3X was associated with increased resistance to a ferroptosis inducer in breast cancer cells, and manipulating DDX3X expression regulated the sensitivity to the ferroptosis inducer. Importantly, DDX3X upregulated expression of the anti-ferroptotic enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) gene to confer ferroptosis resistance in breast cancer cells. Moreover, DDX3X was transcriptionally upregulated by the yes-associated protein (YAP). Knockdown of YAP downregulated DDX3X mRNA expression and facilitated lipid peroxidation, but that were restored in the presence of DDX3X. Clinically, coexpression of DDX3X and YAP was found in a variety of malignancy, and their elevation conferred poor survival prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Together, our findings reveal the crucial role of DDX3X in sensitivity to ferroptosis and underscore its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic Target. DDX3X renders resistance to ferroptosis and plays a role in mitigating lipid peroxidation, paving the way for therapeutic vulnerability via targeting cancer metabolism."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS), often called the \"second brain,\" is a complex network of neurons and glial cells within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It functions autonomously while maintaining close communication with the central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis (GBA). ENS dysfunction plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Disruptions such as altered neurotransmission, gut microbiota imbalance, and neuroinflammation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The GBA enables bidirectional communication through the vagus nerve, gut hormones, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites, linking gut health to neurological function. ENS dysregulation is implicated in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing systemic and CNS pathology through neuroinflammation and impaired barrier integrity. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ENS dysfunction, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and vagus nerve stimulation, which offer novel ways to modulate gut-brain interactions. Unlike previous perspectives that view the ENS as a passive disease marker, this review repositions it as an active driver of neurological disorders. By integrating advances in ENS biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and GBA modulation, this article presents a paradigm shift-emphasizing ENS dysfunction as a fundamental mechanism in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders. This perspective paves the way for innovative diagnostics, personalized gut-targeted therapies, and a deeper understanding of the ENS's role in brain health and disease."

The Spatial Durbin Model was applied to identify the factors that influenced ANPSP. From 2006 to 2020, pollutant loads in the CWSA significantly decreased. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the ANPSP are decreasing. The TN and TP pollution intensity initially increased and then decreased, with the main sources shifting from livestock breeding to fertilizers. There was a significant spatial correlation of ANPSP in the CWSA, and agricultural economic growth and agglomeration exacerbated the ANPSP loads. There were regional differences in the impacts of urbanization, agricultural labor transfer, mechanization, and agricultural production efficiency on ANPSP. The adjustment of planting structure reduced ANPSP loads and produced a positive spillover effect.

Through the stratified method, the five most frequently executed activities were selected: interior and exterior painting, floor ceramics, wall plastering, ceiling and wall plastering. This made it possible to evaluate the ergonomic risk in 94 workers. The evaluation shows that 40 % of the workers were exposed to a high-risk level in the trunk, 2 % in the legs, 20 % in the right arm, and 22 % in the left arm. In short, the five activities adopt forced postures, with REBA scores: medium, high and very high, with high risk level being the most relevant."

        "abstract": "Repetitive lifting tasks in occupational settings often result in shoulder injuries, impacting both health and productivity. Accurately assessing the biomechanical risk of these tasks remains a significant challenge in occupational ergonomics, particularly within manufacturing environments. Traditional assessment methods frequently rely on subjective reports and limited observations, which can introduce bias and yield incomplete evaluations. This study addresses these limitations by generating and utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing detailed time-series electromyography (EMG) data from 25 participants. Using high-precision wearable sensors, EMG data were collected from eight muscles as participants performed repetitive lifting tasks. For each task, the lifting index was calculated using the revised National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation (RNLE). Participants completed cycles of both low-risk and high-risk repetitive lifting tasks within a four-minute period, allowing for the assessment of muscle performance under realistic working conditions. This extensive dataset, comprising over 7 million data points sampled at approximately 1259 Hz, was leveraged to develop deep learning models to classify lifting risk. To provide actionable insights for practical occupational ergonomics and risk assessments, statistical features were extracted from the raw EMG data. Three deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were employed to analyze the data and predict the occupational lifting risk level. The CNN model achieved the highest performance, with a precision of 98.92% and a recall of 98.57%, proving its effectiveness for real-time risk assessments. These findings underscore the importance of aligning model architectures with data characteristics to optimize risk management. By integrating wearable EMG sensors with deep learning models, this study enables precise, real-time, and dynamic risk assessments, significantly enhancing workplace safety protocols. This approach has the potential to improve safety planning and reduce the incidence and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, ultimately promoting better health and safety outcomes across various occupational settings."

This review examines and consolidates the existing literature on rubber crumb in infill in synthetic turf and its associated adverse health outcomes, along with recommendations for future research. A database search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar of studies on exposures to rubber crumb in infills in synthetic turf. The search focused on epidemiological and toxicological laboratory studies (including exposure simulation and animal studies), as well as government reports. Non-English studies and those addressing injuries (musculoskeletal and burn injuries) were not considered. Eighteen laboratory studies examined concentrations of PAHs found in synthetic turf rubber infill. The total level of PAHs detected in samples varied between 0.4 mg/kg and 3196 mg/kg. The PAH levels were influenced by the age of the synthetic turf, with the older synthetic surface fields containing lower concentrations (compared to newly laid turfs). Synthetic turfs composed of industrial rubber crumb infill also had a lower PAH composition relative to end-of-life tyre-derived infill. In the six studies that investigated the metal content and composition of rubber crumb infill, Aluminium (5382 mg/kg), Zinc (5165 mg/kg), and Iron (489.6 mg/kg) had the highest median concentrations. There were minor differences in heavy metal concentrations found in newly installed synthetic turf compared to older turfs and synthetic sporting fields exposed to direct sunlight (versus indoor fields). There were two epidemiological studies on synthetic turf rubber crumb infill (one ecological and one cross-sectional study), which found no significant associations between synthetic turf exposure and the incidence of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Similarly, one metabolomic study of urine samples from athletes taken pre- and post-match on synthetic turf, and two studies simulating dermal, ingestion, and inhalation exposure concluded that there was no elevated health risk associated with playing on synthetic turf pitches. Currently, there is very limited evidence of an association between synthetic turf use and adverse health outcomes. Considering the ubiquitous use of synthetic grass globally and the scarcity of epidemiological studies, there is a vital need for further research based on longitudinal study designs and more robust exposure assessments, to help improve our understanding of any potential health risks associated with synthetic turf infill exposures."

Investigating the effects of BSIEs during such intermittent tasks is crucial to understand translation of their benefits in real-world environments.MethodTwelve participants performed ∼709 task cycles (sustained bending, bending and retraction, standing still, and relaxation activities) with/without BSIE (E/NE) and with/without 45° asymmetry (S/A) towards left until fatigue. Evaluated measures included muscle activity in left (LES)/right (RES) erector spinae and left (LBF)/right (RBF) biceps femoris muscles, endurance, and user perspectives. Temporal effects of fatigue were examined by categorizing muscle activity based on perceived exertion level with Borg scale.ResultsBSIE reduced low-back (LES, RES), and leg (LBF, RBF) mean amplitude by ∼ 18-24% and ∼10-17% respectively. Benefits of BSIE in low-back reduced by ∼11-15% at medium versus low fatigue. Overall, BSIE led to 50% more completed task cycles and was favorably rated by participants in reducing physical demands, most especially during sustained bending portion of the task cycles.ConclusionUsing BSIE in intermittent bending tasks can not only provide benefits in reducing muscle demands but can also delay effects of fatigue in low-back region and increase endurance by enabling wearers to perform more task cycles.ApplicationFindings from this study may be beneficial to practitioners for setting guidelines on implementation of BSIEs in industrial bending tasks."

The research material consisted of peri-implant tissues: fragments of periosteum adhering to a titanium miniplate and blood serum collected from 42 patients treated for mandibular fractures (Group I), and dentofacial deformities (Group II) who underwent bimaxillary osteotomy. The control group consisted of 24 generally healthy patients before bimaxillary osteotomy. The concentrations of selected cytokines, caspase-3, TNF-α in blood serum, and homogenized tissues, were determined using the immunoenzymatic method (ELISA). The concentration of titanium particles was assessed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an X-ray microanalyzer. A significant increase in the concentration of titanium, caspase-3, and TNF-α was observed in serum and periosteum in all patients who underwent bone fixation. Increased TNF-α levels indicate an intense immune response, which may lead to the degradation of peri-implant tissues and bone resorption around the miniplates and screws, while an increase in caspase-3 levels suggests that cells surrounding the implants are destroyed in response to inflammatory stress or damage induced by the presence of titanium particles."

This results in high rates of musculoskeletal injuries that affect at least four in 10 orthopaedic surgeons. Sex disparities exacerbate these issues, with female surgeons reporting markedly higher rates of occupational injuries and discomfort with surgical instrument use compared with male surgeons. Factors such as sustained nonergonomic positions, poor instrument design, improper OR setups, and forceful and repetitive movements contribute to these injuries. With upward of one in three injured orthopaedic surgeons taking leaves, modifying their practices, or retiring prematurely, there is a need to safeguard the health and longevity of the orthopaedic workforce. Surgeons can mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal injuries by maintaining neutral body positions, adjusting their OR environment (e.g., table height), and incorporating brief interventions (e.g., position changes and regular microbreaks). Educating surgeons on these interventions is important for reducing harm. Institutions can consider adapting policies and conducting research focused on enhancing ergonomics to further contribute to creating safer surgical environments. Improving OR ergonomics not only influences orthopaedic surgeon well-being and practice longevity but also enhances patient care and reduces the economic toll of occupational injuries."

Stimuli were videos of shoot and don't shoot variations performed by three actors. Dependent measures were shoot errors, fail-to-shoot errors, response time, and shooting accuracy. Compared to non-officers, LEOs were more accurate and adapted to make fewer fail-to-shoot errors. They were not faster, and did not make fewer shoot errors. Compared to normal cognitive load, under higher load, participants were quicker and more accurate, but made more shoot errors. The higher cognitive load condition revealed effects that were not present under normal load. Participants making more shoot errors had higher BAS, and BIS than those making fewer or no errors."

Sixteen teams of three participants were trained to compile a tactical picture and to complete missions. Teams receiving processed off-board sensor data compiled more accurate tactical pictures, completed missions faster, and reported lower workload, compared to teams receiving raw off-board sensor data. Situation awareness, objective workload, and perceived usability were comparable between conditions. Scenarios with two UAVs took longer to complete, with other outcomes unaffected. These outcomes provide evidence that humans can integrate additional and distinct sources of information to form a cohesive combined picture, even when those data are partially redundant."

The 36 participants were divided into hierarchical and grouping menu groups, demonstrating that grouping menus exhibit better task performance and visual search efficiency. In contrast, hierarchical menus cause a higher subjective mental workload under greater VSWM loads. Theta waves in the occipital brain region indicate reduced mental workload for grouping menus, and alpha waves in the central region correlate with VSWM load. For goal-oriented search tasks, consider the number of fixations and VSWM interference in IVIS testing. Future studies should simulate real menu usage scenarios and multitasking to offer practical design guidance for in-vehicle and aviation systems."

This manifests within action-guiding normative gender stereotypes. This study investigates to which extent these stereotypes may influence the application of genetic engineering. After highlighting potential motivations to enact stereotypes biotechnologically, we propose two potential strategies. People may design future children in close accordance with contemporary gender stereotypes, e.g., to minimize their risk of being punished for non-confirmation, or may create individuals that counteract these stereotypes, e.g., to create a more gender-egalitarian future. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed a large-scale dataset (13,641 virtual children) from an interactive museum exhibit. Here, visitors could design their \"perfect child.\" Gender-dependent differences in designed Big-5-like personality traits and intelligence, musicality, creativity, and sportiness yielded evidence for behavior predicted by both strategies and were inconclusive regarding the dominance of one strategy. Confirming contemporary stereotypes, children deliberately chosen to be male were designed with lower sensibility but higher sportiness than those deliberately chosen to be female. These effects were accompanied by a relatively higher probability of decreasing sensibility and increasing sportiness of these male children. Non-differences among traits like sociality and conscientiousness disconfirmed normative stereotypes and suggested a more egalitarian design. Effect direction, strength, and certainty depended on whether gender was picked deliberately and other factors. Although the ecological setting and methodological limitations hinder a clear interpretation, we provide initial evidence on how genetically engineered children can \"essentially\" embody gender normativity."

        "abstract": "Repetitive lifting tasks in occupational settings often result in shoulder injuries, impacting both health and productivity. Accurately assessing the biomechanical risk of these tasks remains a significant challenge in occupational ergonomics, particularly within manufacturing environments. Traditional assessment methods frequently rely on subjective reports and limited observations, which can introduce bias and yield incomplete evaluations. This study addresses these limitations by generating and utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing detailed time-series electromyography (EMG) data from 25 participants. Using high-precision wearable sensors, EMG data were collected from eight muscles as participants performed repetitive lifting tasks. For each task, the lifting index was calculated using the revised National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation (RNLE). Participants completed cycles of both low-risk and high-risk repetitive lifting tasks within a four-minute period, allowing for the assessment of muscle performance under realistic working conditions. This extensive dataset, comprising over 7 million data points sampled at approximately 1259 Hz, was leveraged to develop deep learning models to classify lifting risk. To provide actionable insights for practical occupational ergonomics and risk assessments, statistical features were extracted from the raw EMG data. Three deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were employed to analyze the data and predict the occupational lifting risk level. The CNN model achieved the highest performance, with a precision of 98.92% and a recall of 98.57%, proving its effectiveness for real-time risk assessments. These findings underscore the importance of aligning model architectures with data characteristics to optimize risk management. By integrating wearable EMG sensors with deep learning models, this study enables precise, real-time, and dynamic risk assessments, significantly enhancing workplace safety protocols. This approach has the potential to improve safety planning and reduce the incidence and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, ultimately promoting better health and safety outcomes across various occupational settings."

        "abstract": "Workplace injury risk due to physically demanding tasks (e.g., repeated lifting) is currently assessed using ergonomic guidelines. The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a commonly used approach that assesses risk of low-back loading during different lifting tasks. Advances in musculoskeletal models have enabled the estimation of physiologically valid person-specific musculoskeletal models (pEMS) driven by surface electromyography and joint angle information. These models offer realistic estimates of objective parameters such as moments and compressive and shear loads at the lumbosacral joint. In this study, we applied both techniques (RNLE and pEMS) to assess risk and low-back loading in seven healthy participants performing lifting tasks at different risk levels. We found that the pEMS estimated objective parameters of low-back loading in line with the different risk levels proposed by RNLE. However, the low-back compressive and shear loads were higher than the limits proposed by the RNLE. Moreover, we show that the lumbosacral compressive loads can be a better parameter to demarcate risk levels. We recommend performing this assessment on a larger and diverse population for evaluation of personalized risk levels across lifting tasks in the industry. These approaches can be implemented with wearable sensorized garments to monitor personalized musculoskeletal health unobtrusively in the workplace providing us a better insight into possibility of individual risk."

Our work challenges the common practice of ergonomists and human factors practitioners to analyze task demands based on one representative posture. We recommend practitioners instead consider variability in adopted postures, as captured by monitoring worker kinematics over the course of a day. The sensitivity of joint demands to small postural changes also underscores the need for using reliable kinematic measurement tools in the field, since results from ergonomic analyses and consequently decision-making can be susceptible to large discrepancies despite small differences in postural inputs."

Environmental data were recorded using portable weather stations. The Workplace Environmental Labor Loss (WELL) functions were developed to describe work time loss due to workplace temperature. Results: The WELL functions revealed a U-shaped relationship whereby the least work time loss is observed at 18 °C (64 °F), and increases for every degree above or below this optimal temperature. Conclusions: The WELL functions quantify the impact of workplace temperature on work time loss, extending to temperatures previously believed to be unaffected."

        "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a highly prevalent condition among healthcare providers (HCPs) worldwide. The physical demands of their jobs predispose them to risk of LBP and other musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). LBP is multifactorial and is thus influenced by psychosocial and occupational risk factors. LBP affects the health and productivity of HCPs and needs to be addressed. This review investigated the psychosocial and occupational factors associated with LBP among HCPs. This research adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Key medical research databases were searched for relevant studies published between 2016 and 2024. Elaborate inclusion/exclusion criteria were implemented to filter down to 14 full-text studies that were included in this systematic review. The 14 studies pointed toward a varying, high prevalence of LBP among HCPs across different regions. Key risk factors for LBP were high physical workload, poor ergonomics, and psychosocial stressors such as high stress levels, job dissatisfaction, and emotional exhaustion. Shift patterns, workload, and other occupational factors influenced LBP prevalence. High physical workload, poor ergonomics, and repetitive tasks were identified as significant risk factors for LBP. Comprehensive interventions targeting ergonomic training, stress management programs, workplace policy modifications, and targeted strategies for high-risk groups are recommended to address the highly prevalent LBP among HCPs."

In a one-factorial design, the impact of UAV indoor flights on human cognitive performance and well-being were analyzed. Fourty-eight participants were divided into an experimental (EG) and a control group (CG) and completed the Work Efficiency Test. In the EG, UAVs flew different path trajectories indoors behind a safety net. Additionally, flow experience, mental effort, and mental strain were measured. Results show that the EG performed marginally worse on the Work Efficiency Test than the CG and experienced less flow during task processing. Additional qualitative interviews showed that participants felt distracted by UAV noise and flight trajectories. Our results corroborate that the human factor cognitive performance should be considered in the implementation of UAV technology in the workplace."

Compared to non-officers, LEOs were more accurate and adapted to make fewer fail-to-shoot errors. They were not faster, and did not make fewer shoot errors. Compared to normal cognitive load, under higher load, participants were quicker and more accurate, but made more shoot errors.

Results showed that transparency here positively influenced compliance with the aid, leading to better task performance. Experiment 2 manipulated transparency via confidence estimates presented alongside the aid's recommendations. There were no benefits from this form of transparency. In Experiment 2, lower compliance with the aid's recommendations was found on more difficult collision problems, via a mediating loss of aid reliability and therefore trust. This runs contrary to the hypothesis that harder problems to solve ought to make participants more, rather than less dependent on the aid. Both experiments produced relatively low correlations between trust and compliance. The findings have important implications for the effectiveness of different kinds of transparency implementations, as well as providing a model/framework for understanding how generic factors such as automation reliability and problem difficulty influence both compliance and trust."

Eighty university staff and students were enrolled in the study by matching age, BMI, and type of job. They were split into two groups later: a control group (n = 40) with no back pain and a pain group (n = 40) with a history of lower back pain (LBP). Pain intensity was measured using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), while SCM muscle activity was measured via surface electromyography (sEMG) during both normal and hunched postures. Participants maintained each posture for a specified duration of 30 min. The study revealed that Pain_Hunched group exhibited significantly reduced SCM muscle activity compared to the Control_Hunched group (mean difference = -9.728, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the SCM muscle activity in the Pain_Hunched group was significantly lower than that of the Pain_Normal group (mean difference = -2.769, p = 0.041). These results highlight the heightened SCM muscle activity during hunched postures, particularly in individuals with LBP. The results emphasize the crucial role posture plays in influencing SCM muscle activation and pain perception among individuals with LBP. These results imply that correcting one's posture could be a useful pain management intervention technique for this population. The long-term impacts of postural adjustments and their possible advantages in clinical contexts, such as incorporating ergonomic interventions or specific exercise regimens, should be investigated in future studies."

Second, the results of a small-N subject-matter expert study will be discussed, highlighting evidence for component-specific trust (CST) and will highlight concerns from expert operators regarding: understanding appropriate inputs for swarm control, transfer of control, general transparency for swarms including the need for understanding why errors might occur and concerns regarding the effects of command latency. Third, human-centred challenges from the use of swarms in the real world will be discussed. These challenges include lessons learned regarding human-swarm interfaces, the intense challenges of logistics when using swarms in the real world, and otherwise hidden challenges of using swarms for real-world scenarios such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET) programme and the use of swarms for monitoring operations for the Air Force Marathon.

This system integrates a multi-modal sensor testbed that captures operator upper body pose, hand pose, and applied force data during hand-intensive composite layup tasks. We introduce the Biometric Assessment of Complete Hand (BACH) ergonomic score, which measures hand and finger risks with greater granularity than existing risk scores for upper body posture (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, or RULA) and hand activity level (HAL). Additionally, we train machine learning models that effectively predict RULA and HAL metrics for new participants, using data collected at the University of Washington in 2023.

This results in high rates of musculoskeletal injuries that affect at least four in 10 orthopaedic surgeons. Sex disparities exacerbate these issues, with female surgeons reporting markedly higher rates of occupational injuries and discomfort with surgical instrument use compared with male surgeons. Factors such as sustained nonergonomic positions, poor instrument design, improper OR setups, and forceful and repetitive movements contribute to these injuries. With upward of one in three injured orthopaedic surgeons taking leaves, modifying their practices, or retiring prematurely, there is a need to safeguard the health and longevity of the orthopaedic workforce. Surgeons can mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal injuries by maintaining neutral body positions, adjusting their OR environment (e.g., table height), and incorporating brief interventions (e.g., position changes and regular microbreaks). Educating surgeons on these interventions is important for reducing harm. Institutions can consider adapting policies and conducting research focused on enhancing ergonomics to further contribute to creating safer surgical environments. Improving OR ergonomics not only influences orthopaedic surgeon well-being and practice longevity but also enhances patient care and reduces the economic toll of occupational injuries."

        "abstract": "A surgeon peers downward into a body cavity when operating. Holding this position for hours across weeks, months, and years may lead to neck pain and musculoskeletal disorders. We were inspired by ungulates such as giraffes and horses, which use dorsal-ventral flexion to graze for 9-14 h per day without perceivable neck pain. Ungulates evolved a strong nuchal ligament that relieves neck muscles by stretching to support some of the weight of the head during grazing or running. In contrast, humans evolved an upright posture, and like many primates, have a reduced nuchal ligament. The goal of this study is to use the nuchal ligament as inspiration for a neck brace that passively supports the weight of the head while still permitting lateral flexion, ventral-dorsal flexion, and rotation. We assembled a prototype using an elastic band, headband, and back posture corrector. Our device augments the human nuchal ligament by using a stiff material and greater mechanical advantage. By our calculations, flexing the head ventrally 40 degrees when wearing the brace reduces the torque applied by neck muscles by 21%. Our device is a proof-of-concept that a bioinspired device can offload neck muscular tension and prevent injury."

A total of 160 housewives recruited from a musculoskeletal disorders clinic were randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: control, biomechanical, psychosocial and comprehensive (biomechanical and psychosocial). Measures were collected before the seven weekly training sessions, immediately after, and three months and six months later. There were significant sustained improvements compared to baseline in the biomechanical and the psychosocial groups for six risk factors, and all seven risk factors in the comprehensive group providing evidence of independent contributions from biomechanical and psychosocial training approaches. This supported the overarching hypothesis that a comprehensive educational intervention can effectively reduce risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders in full-time housewives."

WMSDs, causing pain primarily in the neck, shoulders, and lower back, not only affect individual workers negatively but also result in increased productivity losses and societal costs. Current prevention strategies involve subjective surveys and ergonomic assessments using tools like RULA, REBA, and NIOSH lifting equation. However, these methods have limitations in pinpointing specific improvements for tasks, as evident in cases where high-risk tasks, according to assessments, didn't align with workers' experiences. To address this, the study proposes a foundational exploration for developing a digital musculoskeletal workload assessment system using deep neural networks. The focus is on classifying shoulder flexion/extension postures and estimating endurance times during drilling tasks through surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The methodology involves data collection from healthy male adults performing shoulder-related tasks, utilizing sEMG sensors. The collected data is processed, and a deep neural network model, incorporating recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is developed for posture and task classification as well as endurance time estimation. The study acknowledges the need for further refinement in hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to enhance model performance, aiming to contribute valuable insights for improving industrial work environments and preventing musculoskeletal injuries."

Previous studies utilized human-robot two-dimensional static equilibrium models, ignoring the human body volume and muscle torques, which decreased model accuracy and confined the robot ability to adjust the patient's posture in three-dimensional spatial. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional spatial mechanics modeling method based on individualized human musculoskeletal multibody dynamics. Firstly, based on the mechanical features of dual-arm support, this study constructed a foundational three-dimensional human-robot mechanics model including body posture, contact position and body force. With the computed tomography data from subjects, a three-dimensional femur-pelvis-sacrum model was reconstructed, and the individualized musculoskeletal dynamics was analyzed using the ergonomics software, which derived the human joint forces and completed the mechanic model. Then, this study established a dual-arm robot transfer platform to conduct subject transfer experiments, showing that the constructed mechanics model possessed higher accuracy than previous methods. In summary, this study provides a three-dimensional human-robot mechanics model adapting to individual transfers, which has potential application in various scenarios such as nursing-care and rehabilitating robots."

        "abstract": "Repetitive lifting tasks in occupational settings often result in shoulder injuries, impacting both health and productivity. Accurately assessing the biomechanical risk of these tasks remains a significant challenge in occupational ergonomics, particularly within manufacturing environments. Traditional assessment methods frequently rely on subjective reports and limited observations, which can introduce bias and yield incomplete evaluations. This study addresses these limitations by generating and utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing detailed time-series electromyography (EMG) data from 25 participants. Using high-precision wearable sensors, EMG data were collected from eight muscles as participants performed repetitive lifting tasks. For each task, the lifting index was calculated using the revised National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation (RNLE). Participants completed cycles of both low-risk and high-risk repetitive lifting tasks within a four-minute period, allowing for the assessment of muscle performance under realistic working conditions. This extensive dataset, comprising over 7 million data points sampled at approximately 1259 Hz, was leveraged to develop deep learning models to classify lifting risk. To provide actionable insights for practical occupational ergonomics and risk assessments, statistical features were extracted from the raw EMG data. Three deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were employed to analyze the data and predict the occupational lifting risk level. The CNN model achieved the highest performance, with a precision of 98.92% and a recall of 98.57%, proving its effectiveness for real-time risk assessments. These findings underscore the importance of aligning model architectures with data characteristics to optimize risk management. By integrating wearable EMG sensors with deep learning models, this study enables precise, real-time, and dynamic risk assessments, significantly enhancing workplace safety protocols. This approach has the potential to improve safety planning and reduce the incidence and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, ultimately promoting better health and safety outcomes across various occupational settings."

        "abstract": "As technology advances, human-machine interaction (HMI) demands more intuitive and natural methods. To meet this demand, smart gloves, capable of capturing intricate hand movements, are emerging as vital HMI tools. Moreover, triboelectric-based sensors, with their self-powered, cost-effective, and material various characteristics, can offer promising solutions for enhancing existing glove systems. However, a key limitation of these sensors is that charge leakage in the measurement circuit results in capturing only transient signals, rather than continuous changes. To address this issue, a charge-retained circuit that effectively prevents triboelectric signal attenuation is developed, enabling accurate measurement of continuous finger movements. This innovation forms the foundation of a highly integrated smart glove system, enhancing HMI functionality by combining continuous triboelectric signals with inertial sensor data. The system showcases a diverse range of applications, including complex robotic control, virtual reality interaction, smart home lighting adjustments, and intuitive interface operations. Furthermore, by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the system achieves accurate recognition of complex sign language with an impressive 99.38% accuracy. This work presents a charge-retained approach for continuous sensing with triboelectric-based sensors, offering valuable insights for developing future multifunctional HMI and sign language recognition systems. The proposed smart glove system, with its dual-mode sensing and AI integration, holds great potential for revolutionizing various domains and enhancing user experiences."

Due to a shortage of skilled labour and rising demand, the craft is transitioning to screen printing. The research assesses the feasibility of tools and equipment to ease manual labour, reduce stress, and prevent injuries, while enhancing productivity. The purpose of the study was to propose alternative mechanisms for the craft practices both at unit and cluster levels involving production and non‑production based activities. A survey of 30 artisans revealed strong support for items like anti‑fatigue flooring, measuring stands, and hydro extractors, with over 80% of responses rating them as relevant, useful, and feasible. There is significant association between the awareness and availability of suggested items. The study highlights the importance of introducing ergonomic tools to reduce fatigue, attract younger artisans, and sustain this traditional craft, contributing to both artisan welfare and the preservation of cultural heritage."

This preliminary study examines the effects of visual and olfactory stimuli in a VR-simulated smart home environment on presence, task performance, heart rate, and mood. Sensory conditions, including visual, olfactory, and combined stimuli, were controlled in an experiment with 60 participants to assess both physiological and psychological responses. Task performance was measured through cognitive tests, while heart rate and mood states were monitored using a heart rate sensor and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), respectively. Statistical results showed that the sense of presence provided by VR and specific conditions-such as visual stimuli (e.g., intelligent lighting systems)-effectively enhanced work efficiency, with task performance under visual stimuli significantly outperforming that under olfactory stimuli (e.g., peppermint scent). However, these sensory stimuli did not significantly affect heart rate or emotions. Our findings underscore the potential of sensory design to improve task performance and highlight the importance of the sensory environment in designing home offices, suggesting that sensory stimuli can enhance work efficiency in remote or virtual work settings."

The 3-arm on-demand open Dexter Robotic System was developed to combine the advantages of robot-assisted precision surgery in narrow spaces with the laparoscopic approach for frequent position changes in larger spaces. The system integrates 2 patient carts, a fully controllable endoscope arm, and a sterile surgeon open console, allowing for a rapid switch between robot-assisted surgery and laparoscopy. When switching, the robotic arms may be folded into a laparoscopic home position at any time during a procedure, allowing unrestricted access to the patient. Switches take 15-30 seconds, occurring seamlessly without redocking or recalibrating upon returning to the robotic mode. During oncologic colorectal resections, some procedure steps (eg, central vessel ligation and lymphadenectomy) are best suited for the robotic approach, providing advantages related to 3-dimensional vision, improved ergonomics, and improved dexterity within confined spaces. In contrast, the laparoscopic platform is better suited for procedure steps requiring frequent movements within a large workspace (eg, lateral to medial mobilization of the colon). The Dexter system provides a portfolio of 7 robotic instruments with monopolar and bipolar function operating with any existing available generator. Furthermore, existing operating room equipment, including insufflating devices, optics, and trocars can be used with the Dexter robotic platform. Recently, the first published clinical experience from the authors' institution, involving 12 pilot cases, demonstrated the safety and feasibility for right colonic resections for benign and malignant indications and ventral mesh rectopexies."

A robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach was implemented to evaluate for visceral injury and to repair the abdominal wall. Diagnostic laparoscopy ruled out visceral and diaphragmatic injuries, and robotic primary tissue repair of the abdominal wall was performed. The patient was discharged home the following day. Laparoscopy for hemodynamically stable trauma patients has shown the benefit of decreased morbidity and decreased hospital stay compared to laparotomy.

This article presents ergonomic analyses of HOs in neighborhoods considered heat islands. Temperature levels, extreme low-frequency non-ionizing radiation (ELF-NIR), illuminance, physical layout characteristics, and physiological parameters of teleworkers were measured. The results reveal that 92% of these professionals work 6 to 8 h daily with an ambient temperature between 25 and 30 °C, illumination levels in the range 11.20-290 Lux, and ELF-NIR > 0.4 µT. The majority of teleworkers are overweight (BMI > 24.9), and some of them have blood pressure higher than average values (129 mmHg for systolic and 84 mmHg for diastolic) in addition to a reduction in the number of red blood cells and hematocrits. Symptoms such as burning sensation, dryness, tired eyes, redness, itching, and photophobia (light sensitivity) show a 68.95% similarity.

        "abstract": "Extra-retinal photoreception is common across fish and avian species. In birds, the hypothalamus contains non-visual photoreceptors that detect light and regulate multiple endocrine systems. To date, light-dependent control of seasonal reproduction is one of the most well-studied systems that require deep brain photoreception. However, the precise photoreceptor(s) that detect light and the neuroendocrine connection between opsin-expressing cells and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH1) system remain poorly defined. In the past couple of decades, two opsin molecules have been proposed to link light detection with seasonal reproduction in birds: neuropsin (Opn5) and vertebrate ancient opsin (VA opsin). Only VA opsin is expressed in GnRH1 cells and has an absorption spectrum that matches the action spectrum of the avian photoperiodic reproductive response. This perspective describes how the annual change in daylength, referred to as photoperiod, regulates the neuroendocrine control of seasonal reproduction. The opsin genes are then outlined, and the cellular phototransduction cascade is described, highlighting the common feature of hyperpolarization in response to light stimulation. We then discuss the latest evidence using short-hairpin RNA to temporarily knock down VA opsin and Opn5 on transcripts involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction. Based on emerging data, we outline three theoretical scenarios in which VA opsin might regulate GnRH1 synthesis and release in birds. The models proposed provide a series of testable hypotheses that can be used to improve our understanding of avian light detection by VA opsin or other opsin-expressing cells in the brain."

Diverse ZI functions can be attributed to its heterogeneous neurochemical characterization, cytoarchitecture, and efferent connections. The ZI is predominantly GABAergic, but we recently identified a subset of medial ZI GABA cells that are marked by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and produce dopamine (DA). While the role of GABA within the ZI is well studied, less is known about the functions of ZI DA cells. To identify potential roles of ZI DA cells, we further phenotyped them and mapped their efferent fiber projections. We showed that wild-type TH-immunoreactive (-ir) ZI cells did not express somatostatin or calretinin immunoreactivity. We next validated a Th-cre;L10-Egfp mouse line and found that medial Egfp ZI cells were more likely to be TH-ir. We therefore delivered a Cre-dependent virus into the medial ZI of Th-cre or Th-cre;L10-Egfp mice and selected two injection cases for full brain mapping, namely, cases with the lowest and highest colocalization between TH-ir and virally transduced, DsRed-labeled cells, to identify common target sites. Overall, DsRed-labeled fibers were distributed brainwide and were most prominent within the motor-related midbrain (MBmot), notably the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus. We also observed numerous DsRed-labeled fibers within the polymodal association cortex-related thalamus (DORpm), like paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of reunions, that processes external and internal sensory input. Overall, ZI DA cells displayed a similar fiber profile to ZI GABA cells and may integrate sensory input to coordinate motor output at their target sites."

        "abstract": "Glucose acts as a fundamental energy source for cells and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including metabolism, signaling, and cellular control. Maintaining precise regulation of blood glucose levels is crucial for overall health and equilibrium. To achieve this balance, insulin is administered either orally or through an artificial pancreas (AP) during sleep, utilizing control algorithms based on mathematical models to regulate blood glucose concentration (BGC). The extended Bergman minimal model (EBMM) is an advanced mathematical framework that incorporates a state variable to accommodate disturbances in insulin levels triggered by factors such as meal intake or exercise-induced sugar burning. In our study, we propose robust nonlinear controllers: adaptive backstepping sliding mode control (AB-SMC), and adaptive backstepping integral super twisting sliding mode control (ABIST-SMC) and compare these with the backstepping sliding mode control (B-SMC) for stabilizing BGC in type 1 diabetic patients. These controllers aim to regulate blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetic patients by providing robust and adaptive control strategies that mitigate disturbances and ensure stability, ultimately enhancing health outcomes and quality of life. Moreover, adaptive parameter estimation is incorporated to eliminate the need for exact model parameter values for control design. The controller gains are meticulously fine-tuned using improved grey wolf optimization, with the integral time absolute error serving as the objective function. Notably, the ABIST-SMC controller emerges as the most efficient, achieving the desired reduction level in less than 1.92 min. The stability of the proposed controllers is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov control theory, demonstrating their capability to achieve asymptotic stability. Simulations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the suggested controllers. Additionally, hardware validation is executed using a hardware-in-loop experimental setup."

We apply mixed effects models for the linear outcome of sleep duration and cumulative link mixed models for the sleep quality variables, controlling for socio-demographic and health characteristics. In model 1, our findings show that, compared to full-time employees, all categories of workers and non-workers report longer sleep hours. Some sub-groups, such as contract workers, report higher odds of waking up at night or in the early morning, and taking longer time to fall asleep. In model 2, we find a positive association between working time and sleep hours but including job satisfaction in the model absorbs such a relationship, indicating the job satisfaction somehow reflects working time. Poor job satisfaction is linked to higher odds of experiencing difficulties in four of the five sleep quality measures."

This evolutionary process has been particularly vivid in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), as this cancer and associated precursor lesions, including Barrett's esophagus (BE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), co-exist in an accessible, two-dimensional pattern in esophageal mucosa. Given the durability of these precursor lesions, it is likely that they, like EAC, rely on stem cells for their regenerative growth. To assess the role of stem cells in the evolution of EAC, we apply technology that selectively clones stem cells from the gastrointestinal tract to patient-matched endoscopic biopsies from each of the precursor lesions implicated in EAC."

In the past decade, simple rapid diagnostic tests were introduced for gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, facilitating screening in primary health-care facilities. A new oral drug, fexinidazole, became the first-line treatment for gambiense human African trypanosomiasis without severe meningo-encephalitic disease, as well as for rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis. Medical interventions, in some areas combined with tiny target-based vector control, have substantially reduced human African trypanosomiasis incidence, despite temporary disruptions to health-care systems. The elimination of human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem has been achieved, and elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis transmission is now targeted for 2030. Improved diagnostics and drugs, continued involvement of populations at risk of disease, health staff, national authorities, and partners and donors all contribute to achieve this goal."

Few studies have examined programmable artificial lighting systems in hospital patient rooms, and few have achieved meaningful improvement in sleep. We sought to determine how novel dynamic lighting affects sleep timing and duration compared to standard hospital lighting. Patients were admitted to rooms on a cardiology unit with customised intervention or standard lighting. The lighting system delivered blue-enriched light during the day, a melanopic stimulus twice daily and blue-depleted light in the evening. Sleep/wake probability was measured in 30-s epochs using mattress sensors to capture sleep timing and nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep duration and alertness were assessed with sleep diaries and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), respectively. A total of 87 patients were enrolled. Subjects experiencing customised lighting demonstrated significantly advanced rest/wake activity phase by 160 min and overall greater sleep probability. Overnight sleep duration (11 p.m.-7 a.m.) was 66 min greater in the lighting condition (266 vs. 200 min, p < 0.05). Patients in the intervention group reported higher levels of alertness during the morning (KSS score 3.8 vs. 4.9, p = 0.01) and evening (5.4 vs. 7.1, p = 0.01). A lighting system programmed to entrain the circadian rhythm and provide a daytime melanopic stimulus on a hospital unit was associated with advanced circadian phase, increased nocturnal sleep duration and increased perceived morning and evening alertness. These results suggest that dynamic lighting systems have the potential to improve sleep for hospitalised patients."

This study investigated the associations between sleep health and familial social support, familial intragroup marginalization, familial conflict, and living environment (i.e., living with parent(s) or legal guardian(s)) among Hispanic adults. Hispanic adult college students (n = 455) completed a survey assessing demographics, sleep quality, and familial social support, intragroup marginalization, and conflict. One hierarchical multiple linear regression model assessed the associations between these familial factors, living environment, and sleep quality. Results indicated that poorer sleep quality was associated with greater familial conflict in the full hierarchical regression model (i.e., Step 6). In Step 2 though, poorer sleep quality was inversely associated with familial social support, yet this association disappeared once familial intragroup marginalization was entered. Post-hoc mediation analysis revealed that familial social support was inversely indirectly associated with sleep quality through familial intragroup marginalization and conflict serially. Living environment did not moderate any relationships between familial factors and sleep quality. That familial social support was initially associated with enhanced sleep quality until familial intragroup marginalization was considered suggests that familial negativity may have a greater impact on sleep health than familial social support. Further, familial social support may influence sleep quality through familial negativity. Familial conflict may be particularly detrimental for sleep health. Clinical implications are discussed. Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess temporality."

ADHD is treated with both stimulant and nonstimulant medications, but their therapeutic mechanisms and impact on brain metabolites are not fully understood. This study employed an untargeted metabolomics approach with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to investigate the pathogenesis of ADHD, as well as the effects of established and novel therapeutics. We characterized the metabolomic signatures of the adgrl3.1 mutant zebrafish ADHD model and examined the impact of methylphenidate, guanfacine, atomoxetine, and 5 novel putative therapeutics identified in a prior screen, including amlodipine. Our analysis revealed that the drugs commonly affect pathways related to amino acid and lipid metabolism, specifically involving glycine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. This convergence on similar metabolic targets was unexpected and suggests a broader, systemic effect of ADHD therapeutics, challenging the traditional view of distinct drug mechanisms. Amlodipine exhibited metabolic effects consistent with established treatments, indicating its potential as a viable alternative or adjunct therapy. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic underpinnings of ADHD and highlight potential targets for developing improved therapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study explores the metabolic pathways affected by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder treatments using a zebrafish adgrl3.1 mutant model. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that both established and novel attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications influence common amino acid and lipid metabolism pathways, suggesting systemic effects. Notably, amlodipine showed similar impacts as current drugs, offering promise as an alternative therapy."

        "abstract": "Glucose acts as a fundamental energy source for cells and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including metabolism, signaling, and cellular control. Maintaining precise regulation of blood glucose levels is crucial for overall health and equilibrium. To achieve this balance, insulin is administered either orally or through an artificial pancreas (AP) during sleep, utilizing control algorithms based on mathematical models to regulate blood glucose concentration (BGC). The extended Bergman minimal model (EBMM) is an advanced mathematical framework that incorporates a state variable to accommodate disturbances in insulin levels triggered by factors such as meal intake or exercise-induced sugar burning. In our study, we propose robust nonlinear controllers: adaptive backstepping sliding mode control (AB-SMC), and adaptive backstepping integral super twisting sliding mode control (ABIST-SMC) and compare these with the backstepping sliding mode control (B-SMC) for stabilizing BGC in type 1 diabetic patients. These controllers aim to regulate blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetic patients by providing robust and adaptive control strategies that mitigate disturbances and ensure stability, ultimately enhancing health outcomes and quality of life. Moreover, adaptive parameter estimation is incorporated to eliminate the need for exact model parameter values for control design. The controller gains are meticulously fine-tuned using improved grey wolf optimization, with the integral time absolute error serving as the objective function. Notably, the ABIST-SMC controller emerges as the most efficient, achieving the desired reduction level in less than 1.92 min. The stability of the proposed controllers is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov control theory, demonstrating their capability to achieve asymptotic stability. Simulations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the suggested controllers. Additionally, hardware validation is executed using a hardware-in-loop experimental setup."

We use four waves of the Japan Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) to address the relationship between weekday sleep duration, self-reported sleep quality and four self-reported indicators of sleep quality and employment status (model 1, full sample), working hours and job satisfaction (model 2, working sample) among individuals aged 50 and over (N=7,082). We apply mixed effects models for the linear outcome of sleep duration and cumulative link mixed models for the sleep quality variables, controlling for socio-demographic and health characteristics. In model 1, our findings show that, compared to full-time employees, all categories of workers and non-workers report longer sleep hours. Some sub-groups, such as contract workers, report higher odds of waking up at night or in the early morning, and taking longer time to fall asleep. In model 2, we find a positive association between working time and sleep hours but including job satisfaction in the model absorbs such a relationship, indicating the job satisfaction somehow reflects working time. Poor job satisfaction is linked to higher odds of experiencing difficulties in four of the five sleep quality measures."

The use of oral appliances (OA) has been presented as a possible management option for mild obstructive sleep apnea among adults. In children, although oral interventions are not supported as a first-line stand-alone management option for OSA, short-term studies have suggested an improvement in sleep signs and symptoms in milder cases. The monitoring of management outcomes from OA interventions is essential to monitor OSA conditions. Due to the chronic nature of OSA, the measure of dental patient-reported outcomes (dPROs) will likely help to understand interplaying factors that may influence the effectiveness of OA interventions among subjects with OSA. This narrative review discusses the current evidence regarding main dPROs in OSA, evaluation methods, and the contribution of oral health professionals in assessing it for both children and adults. The main dPROs assessed among OA users include quality of life, treatment adherence, and side effects. The use of validated tools to measure dPROs must be preferred when available. Overall, the clinical assessment of dPROs by oral health professionals is likely beneficial to monitoring OSA management outcomes and must be encouraged as part of an interdisciplinary approach led by the sleep physician."

The experimental group included 21 participants who received a combination of VR and optokinetic stimulation in addition to VRT, while the control group, also made up of 21 individuals, only received optokinetic stimulation in conjunction with VRT. We administered the intervention sessions twice weekly over a span of 6 weeks, resulting in a total of 10-intervention sessions. Additionally, baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up assessments were conducted.ResultsOur analysis revealed that participants in both groups significantly improved with no significant differences between the groups. Individuals undergoing VR interventions demonstrated marked improvements across all of the assessed parameters including the primary outcome measure that were reduced from 41.55 (11.87) to 23.40 (14.17) ("

        "abstract": "Individuals spend roughly two-thirds of their day awake, with about half of that time in an offline state. This period may appear unproductive, potentially leading to perceived inefficiency. However, this period appears to be an essential component of our daily lives. Studies have increasingly found that quiet and wakeful rest after learning facilitates the consolidation of newly acquired memories, and enhances memory performance. Few studies quantitatively assessed the overall effect size of wakeful rest on memory consolidation, or examined the potential moderating factors. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis, compiled from 37 studies, including a total of 63 experiments that contributed 82 comparisons to this meta-analysis. We used a multilevel random-effects model to reveal a significant effect of wakeful rest on memory consolidation (Hedges's g = 0.448, 95% CI [0.339, 0.557], Z = 8.044, p < .001), and this effect persists even after 7 days (Hedges's g = 0.270, 95% CI [0.024, 0.516], Z = 2.153, p = .031). The effect of wakeful rest was influenced by age, with older adults deriving greater benefits compared with younger adults. Across different outcome measurements, the effect was better reflected by recall than by recognition. Additionally, the duration of wakeful rest, whether the eyes are open or closed, the luminance level, and the body posture do not seem to influence the wakeful rest effect. This meta-analysis offers a deep understanding of the effects of wakeful rest on memory consolidation and provides guidance for the experimental designs of future research in this area."

We classified the participants by their sleep duration: short-, middle-, and long-sleep groups. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and divided into PSQI ≤ 5, 6-8, and ≥ 9 groups. Physical frailty was operationalized with the Fried phenotype. A logistic regression model was used to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for frailty status outcomes. The prevalence of frailty was 4.7%. The ORs for the presence of frailty in the long-sleep group was 8.50 (95%CI: 2.82-25.62) compared to the middle-sleep group, and the PSQI ≥ 9 group was 2.81 (95%CI: 1.08-7.33) compared to the PSQI ≤ 5 group. Short sleep and poor sleep quality were associated with exhaustion; long sleep was associated with low physical activity. The duration and quality of sleep may thus have different effects on frailty components. The possible causal relationship between sleep duration/quality and frailty merits further investigation."

Using an annotated dataset from 15 neonates (10 preterm, 5 full-term) encompassing 127.2 hours, a comprehensive feature extraction and selection process was employed. Three classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors) were evaluated to develop a QS estimation model. A compact and interpretable model was selected, achieving a balanced accuracy of 84.67.5%. The robustness of the model was further enhanced by incorporating a switching mechanism between models using only ECG and respiration when video data was unavailable. The study further explored the evolution of QS during hospitalization using a large dataset with 18 newborns (16 preterm and 2 term) and 1396.6 hours of data. It highlighted an increase in QS duration and mean interval duration with post-menstrual age. The results offer valuable insights into the developmental progress of healthy preterm infants and underscore the potential of continuous, non-invasive monitoring in neonatal intensive care units."

Initial data indicate acute mood benefits of slow-wave sleep deprivation (SWSD) in depressed adults, but it is unclear whether this may occur through improvement in emotion regulation. In addition, this has not been tested experimentally in adolescent depression. In this pilot study, we tested the effect of SWSD on emotion regulation in adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms. Fifteen adolescents (mean age [SD] = 17.47 [1.55] years, 12 female) completed three consecutive nights of polysomnographic sleep recording: Baseline, SWSD, and Recovery. Auditory stimulation (sounds of varying pitch, duration, and volume) suppressed slow-wave sleep (SWS) during SWSD. After Baseline and SWSD nights, the Emotional Go/No-Go task was administered the next day as a behavioural assessment of cognitive control, emotion discrimination, and emotion regulation outcomes. False Discovery Rate was used to account for multiple comparison correction. We found that, at Baseline, longer SWS duration was associated with poorer emotion discrimination (β = -0.44, p = 0.012, Q = 0.036). There was no association between other sleep stages and emotion regulation. While Emotional Go/No-Go outcomes did not significantly differ between Baseline and SWSD nights, greater attenuation in SWS significantly correlated with improvement in cognitive control (β = 0.61, p = 0.021, Q = 0.038), emotion discrimination (β = -0.44, p = 0.025, Q = 0.038), and emotion regulation (β = 0.62, p = 0.049, Q = 0.049) between nights. Findings from this pilot study tie elevated SWS to impaired emotion regulation in adolescents with depressive symptoms and suggest that targeted deprivation of SWS may improve emotion regulation in depressed adolescents with elevated SWS."

Sleep debt (1-120 min and >2 h, respectively) was dose-dependently associated with increased risk of common cold (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.78; aOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.30-4.13), pneumonia/bronchitis (aOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.07-4.90; aOR 3.88, 95% CI 1.44-10.47), sinusitis (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.22-3.54; aOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.19-5.59), and gastrointestinal infection (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.00-2.11; aOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.39-4.31), compared to no sleep debt. Night work (yes/no) (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00-1.64) and number of night shifts (1-20 compared to 0 nights) (aOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08-2.06) were associated with increased risk of common cold. Sleep duration and quick returns were not associated with any of the infections. In conclusion, shift- and night work were associated with increased risk of common cold. Sleep debt was dose-dependently associated with an increased risk of several infections."

Through a randomized trial, we compare RFA effectiveness to a control group, aiming to establish its potential role in managing OSA in this vulnerable population. The control group received only weight loss and tongue-retaining device recommendations. In the intervention group, these measures were supplemented with RFA of the soft palate and inferior turbinates. After three months, both groups were assessed for changes in sleep study parameters, BMI, and tongue-retaining device adherence. Twenty patients in the control group and 23 in the intervention group completed the trial. The average age was 60.25 years old (SD = 5.88) in the control group and 61.83 years old (SD = 5.21) in the RFA group. Both groups experienced significant BMI reductions, with the control group averaging a decrease of 1.5 kg/m² (SD = 2.4 kg/m²) and the RFA group averaging a decrease of 1.3 kg/m² (SD = 1.1 kg/m²). Tongue-retaining device adherence was 50% in the control group and 56.5% in the RFA group.

This study examined the prevalence of self-medication in patients who had undergone kidney transplantation. These patients, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, are informed during post-transplant therapeutic education about the risks associated with drug interactions. This prospective single-center study, including 66 patients, shows that 80.3% of participants reported self-medicating one month after hospital discharge, with 18.2% engaging in practices deemed “risky”. Self-medication mainly involved analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sleeping pills, and treatments for heartburn, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antacids. The results show that neither age, sex, education level, nor employment status were significantly associated with risky self-medication. However, the high prevalence of this practice highlights the need for increased patient awareness of potential dangers, particularly those related to NSAIDs and drug interactions. PPIs, often used for heartburn, carry interaction risks, especially with tacrolimus, and prolonged use may lead to kidney complications. Herbal medicine, also used by some patients, may present interaction risks with immunosuppressants. The study suggests strengthening patient therapeutic education (PTE) by emphasizing the risks of inappropriate self-medication and proposes safe alternatives, such as antacids, or seeking medical consultation. These results, based on self-reported data, may underestimate the true prevalence of self-medication. The study recommends continuous vigilance and further research to assess these practices over the long term."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its associated factors among older adults living in the community of Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia, in 2023. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gondar town from February 20 to April 30, 2023. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a validated tool. Data were coded using Epi data version 3.0 and analyzed in STATA 14. Associated factors were examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. In this study a total of 845 study participants were involved with 99.5% response rate. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among elderly community was 54.6% with 95% CI (51- 58%). Age of ≥ 75 years [AOR = 3.88, 95% CI: 2.11-7.10], poor social support [AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 2.35-5.81], physically inactive [AOR = 4.42, 95% CI: 3.11-6.26], chronic disease [AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 2.45-5.55] and depression [AOR = 2.01, 95% (CI: 1.42-2.83)] were factors associated with poor sleep quality. 55% of community-dwelling older adults in Gondar town experience poor sleep quality, particularly those with depression, advanced age, chronic diseases, and poor social support. To address this, enhancing community support and social networking activities is recommended. Engaging in physical activities has shown to significantly improve sleep quality. Healthcare providers should conduct regular screenings for sleep quality issues and provide education about sleep hygiene to enhance sleep quality among older adults. Future researchers are encouraged to use Longitudinal studies to explore the impact of poor sleep quality in older communities."

Yet, the role of \"digital detox\", defined as a voluntary reduction or temporary cessation of device use, remains only partially understood as both a clinical and lifestyle intervention. This comprehensive scoping review was conducted to consolidate existing research on digital detox interventions and evaluate contextual factors that may influence their effectiveness for mental health and well-being. A targeted keyword search for \"digital detox\" was conducted in the PubMed database on December 12, 2024, yielding 34 initial results. This review followed the approach recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to identify, screen, and extract evidence from relevant studies as per pre-specified inclusion criteria. A total of 14 studies were found eligible, and data from these studies and their relevant references (totaling 640 citations) were extracted and synthesized. Our findings suggest that digital detox interventions may alleviate depression and problematic internet use, and individuals with higher baseline symptom severity appear to derive higher benefits. However, the impact on broader outcomes such as life satisfaction and overall well-being remains variable. Divergent intervention approaches, ranging from short-term SM abstinence to sustained, moderate device restrictions and individual differences in baseline severity of symptoms, coping styles, environmental pressures, and support systems, may contribute to different outcomes across various studies and systematic reviews. Overall, age, gender, baseline mental health, and range and duration of DT usage prior to detox are the key variables that may determine the effectiveness of digital detox interventions. Tailored DT usage in moderation, aligned with each individual's age, developmental stage, and academic needs, has greater benefits among younger populations, particularly adolescents and young adults, while mindful and regulated SM use is especially advantageous for female populations. However, other populations could also benefit, provided interventions address self-regulation challenges specific to adult lifestyles. Given the growing global prevalence of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and its documented comorbidity with psychiatric disorders, digital detox strategies have the potential to be integrated into clinical recommendations and policy initiatives. However, a framework for assessing intervention quality and long-term outcomes is essential."

Cytochrome P450 (P450) is one of the most abundant phase 1 drug-metabolizing enzymes and is accountable for a great deal of pharmacokinetic botanical-drug interactions. This problem is particularly acute for older adults who often consume BDS with multiple prescription medicines. The consequences of botanical-drug interactions can lead to lack of prodrug efficacy or drug toxicity from reduced drug clearance through inhibition of P450 metabolizing enzymes. In this study, a 7-in-1 cocktail P450 inhibition assay with 7 Food and Drug Administration-recommended P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5) including CYP2B6 recombinant enzyme was performed, minimizing substrate interactions with respect to specificity while maximizing assay sensitivity. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for quantitative determination of probe substrate metabolism. Withania somnifera L.

This systematic review aimed to (1) explicate nocturnal caregiving practice (NCP) by identifying and synthesising peer-reviewed research to establish the prevalence and nature of NCP, (2) explore the impacts of NCP for caregivers, (3) evaluate the perceived value of technology for supporting NCP, and (4) examine potential solutions for mitigating NCP burden. In January, 2022, the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies, published in English since 1997, which addressed NCP for juveniles with T1D. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies were included. Risk of bias analysis was carried out using the quality assessment with diverse studies tool. Where possible, quantitative data were aggregated. Qualitative data was subjected to a narrative synthesis, using thematic analysis. Thirty-one studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 3,547 caregivers. 88% of caregivers engaged in NCP, though frequency was variable. Over 50% of participants (19-80%) failed to get adequate sleep and 54% reported poor sleep quality. Qualitative testimony detailed adverse impacts of NCP; exhaustion, difficulty making illness-management decisions, negative impacts on mood and physical health. Benefits from technology were equivocal. Evidence regarding predictors and associations for NCP, such as patient age, was contradictory. 83% of authors recommended that sleep be routinely addressed in clinic, which is not current practice. This review provides clear evidence that NCP in T1D is pervasive with significant negative impacts on caregivers. These secondary impacts of juvenile T1D need to be acknowledged so that care guidelines can be modified and psychosocial supports can be developed for use in clinical treatment environments."

One concept that emphasizes an individual's active lifestyle is physical literacy (PL). However, the relationship between PL and 24 h movement guidelines in adolescents has not been analyzed to date. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived physical literacy (PPL) and adherence to the 24-hour movement guidelines in Spanish adolescents. This cross-sectional study included a total of 56 adolescents (mean age 13.2 ± 1.3 years). PL was assessed using the Spanish Perceived Physical Literacy Instrument for Adolescents (S-PPLI), categorizing participants into low, medium, and high PPL levels. To determine compliance with movement guidelines (24-hour movement), physical activity was assessed through accelerometry, while screen time and sleep duration were evaluated using questionnaires. One-way ANOVA and chi-square analysis were used to examine PPL levels and adherence to the 24-hour movement guidelines. The results indicated that higher levels of PPL were associated with greater adherence to the 24-hour movement guidelines. Specifically, most participants met one or two recommendations as PPL increased ("

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Sleep deprivation is a growing concern in cardiovascular risk, causing physiological disruptions like autonomic dysregulation and inflammation. Recent research indicates that sleep deprivation increases sympathetic nervous activity while decreasing parasympathetic activity, leading to increased blood pressure, impaired endothelial function, and heightened inflammation. Exercise has emerged as a non-pharmacological approach to increase cardiovascular health. However, the impact of exercise on sleep deprivation-induced changes in autonomic activity and inflammation remains unclear. To explore this, we reviewed studies investigating the effects of acute exercise on autonomic regulation and inflammatory markers following sleep deprivation. We conducted a narrative review of the literature. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Web of Science (WOS) searched the articles between May 2022 and April 2023. The papers had to: [1] focus on recent studies between 2000 and 2023; [2] consist of sleep deprivation participants; [3] be published in English. Acute moderate- to high-intensity exercise after sleep deprivation may reduce parasympathetic activity, trigger pro-inflammatory cytokines, and delay recovery to normal levels. In contrast, regular exercise routines may mitigate the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on autonomic regulation and reduce systemic inflammation. Sleep deprivation can lead to autonomic imbalance, increased blood pressure, and increased inflammatory responses, which are further amplified by acute exercise, increasing the cardiovascular burden. When sleep deprivation occurs, exercise intensity and timing should be carefully chosen to avoid adverse cardiovascular health risks."

Continuous KRT (CKRT) is used across many ICUs as the therapy of choice for hemodynamically unstable patients with kidney failure. Though existing trials have not shown superior survival or kidney recovery with CKRT relative to intermittent KRT, CKRT has largely become the standard of care in developed nations for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with shock, acute brain injury, acute liver failure, and other forms of critical illness. As health care systems provide an ever-widening scope of organ-support therapies to increasingly complicated ICU patients, the use of CKRT is likely to expand. In this Core Curriculum, we review the physicochemical principles of CKRT, provide a comprehensive yet practical review of when and how to prescribe CKRT, and summarize seminal trials that serve as the foundations for our approaches to timing of initiation, dosing, vascular access, and anticoagulation for CKRT. We conclude by briefly highlighting a variety of essential, yet often underappreciated, components of the provision of high-value multidisciplinary care to patients receiving CKRT, including drug dosing, nutrition, physical rehabilitation, and CKRT quality assurance programs."

The long history of sleep research has culminated in population-derived normative values of 7 to 9 h of sleep per night to avoid dysfunction. Such a wide range is sufficiently large that one cannot know what is required for any given individual. 'Sleep need' cannot currently be directly measured, might not be represented by one number (given the multiple functions that sleep subserves), and likely varies from individual-to-individual and from day-to-day. This said, the concept should be embraced and can be considered alongside more easily operationalised and routinely measured constructs of 'sleep opportunity' (e.g., time in bed) and 'sleep ability' (i.e., the obtained sleep, such as sleep duration). Considering the dynamics of all three constructs together may drive greater understanding about sleep health, sleep insufficiency, and sleep disorder pathology. In this article, we describe a new theory called Sleep Opportunity, Need, and Ability and provide a rationale for why this theory has both theoretical and clinical value."

This paper discusses a strategy to interpret multifeatured longitudinal wearable data to analyse possible causes of health issues. We use the sleep domain as a case example where the aim is to clarify the reasons for poor sleep quality. A dataset with wearable data of 1874 days was used to create an explainable DL model, which indicates the main day-before-night sleep behaviours that may cause poor sleep quality. We use a comparative analysis with a hormone-based framework for sleep control as the form of validation. The results show that the explanations corroborate the results of the literature. However, other datasets with more features should be explored to verify the combination of these features and their effects on the health aspect under study."

Measures of active phase amplitude (M10), rest amplitude (L5) total sleep time (TST) and time in bed (TIB) from actigraphy data and questionnaires results were correlated with COP variables. The actigraphy parameter that shows larger nocturnal activities (L5) showed positive correlations with larger COP excursions, whereas variability of M10, which can be interpreted as smaller routines of daily activities, showed negative correlations.

The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we investigated the consequences of CIH on the ischemic retina of the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. We show that experimental CIH inhibited colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) expression, blunting the reactive microgliosis during the ischemic phase of OIR. CIH severely delayed beneficial revascularization of the ischemic retina and increased pathological neovascularization. CIH also induced photoreceptor segment thinning and accentuated OIR-induced inner and outer retinal functional deficits. Mechanistically we demonstrated that local CSF1R inhibition during ischemic retinopathy reduced the number of microglial cells, inhibited revascularization, and exacerbated pathological neovascularization, recapitulating the effects of CIH. Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which sleep apnea and CIH aggravate ischemic retinopathies, underscoring the importance of treating apnea in DR and ROP to help prevent sight threatening severe disease."

The hallmarks of MPS III are relatively minor somatic abnormalities with severe and progressive central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. An analysis of the literature showed that the biggest problems for carers of people with MPS III are behavioural disorders and sleep disorders. Despite extensive discussions on improving the quality of life of patients, little attention was paid to the families/carers of patients. The families/carers are providing appropriate medical and palliative care to the patient every day due to their loss of mobility, self-care skills, tube feeding, airway clearance and other supports continue to have an adverse effect on the quality of life of families/carers. However, a literature review of possible solutions showed that effective methods (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) exist. The needs of carers of MPS III patients should receive as much attention as the search for new treatments. There are many options for dealing with such problems. The key issue is to identify the source of the problem and choose the most effective therapy. Alleviating behavioural disorders, pain complaints and sleep problems will have a positive impact not only on the quality of life of carers/families, but also on the patients themselves."

Ninety Mandarin native speakers were pseudo-randomly assigned to either a nap group, who napped for 1.5 h with brain activities recorded, or the non-nap group, who rested for 1.5 h. They were trained with Cantonese contour-level tonal contrasts and level-level tonal contrasts, followed by a tone identification task (trained talker) before the nap manipulation, and were re-tested (trained and novel talkers) after the nap. The results showed that naps facilitated Cantonese tone learning, with the nap group outperforming the non-nap group in the cross-talker perception. The cross-talker perception effect was specific to contour-level tonal contrasts (consistent with prior knowledge) and was associated with increased sleep spindles and slow oscillations. The findings suggest that prior knowledge plays an important role in prioritizing contour-level tonal contrasts for memory consolidation."

Cortisol, which is essential for stress regulation, can cause tissue damage when elevated for long periods of time, which is a common problem for office workers in stressful environments. Sleep quality is important for health and cognitive function, while sleep deprivation increases the risk of physical and mental health disorders. Gyrokinesis combines circular, spiral, and wave movements influenced by yoga, tai chi, and ballet to provide a calming effect on the sympathetic nervous system. This study investigated the effects of Gyrokinesis exercise on lower extremity edema, muscle strength, fatigue, and sleep quality in sedentary office workers. Twenty-seven adult women aged 20-40 years were randomly assigned to a Gyrokinesis exercise group (n=14) or a control group (n=13). The exercise group participated in 60-min Gyrokinesis sessions twice a week for 8 weeks, while the control group used elastic compression stockings during their working hours. Results showed a significant decrease in fatigue and an improvement in sleep quality in the exercise group. Cortisol and serotonin levels showed a significant between-group interaction effect, with within-group changes observed only in the exercise group. Sleep quality indices improved significantly over time. In conclusion, Gyrokinesis exercise has the potential to improve physical and psychological well-being in sedentary office workers by positively influencing fatigue, sleep quality, and related hormone levels."

This study evaluated 164 patients with type 2 diabetes and found that 75% had obstructive sleep apnoea, with 31% requiring treatment for moderate to severe cases. Predicting obstructive sleep apnoea for which medical treatment is indicated (i.e., moderate to severe OSA) proved challenging, as typical clinical symptoms and most other readily available clinical parameters proved to be unreliable indicators. However, central fat distribution, indicated by a higher waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio 3.31, 95% confidence interval 1.91-6.25, p = 0.0032), and the presence of albuminuria (odds ratio 7.46, 95% confidence interval 1.99-27.89, p = 0.0244), emerged as significant predictors, with albuminuria representing a novel finding. Screening tools such as the STOP-Bang questionnaire had limited predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of targeted screening in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with central fat distribution or albuminuria, to reduce underdiagnosis and potentially improve treatment outcomes."

        "abstract": "Circadian rhythms influence various physiological and behavioral processes such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. In Drosophila, an important set of circadian output neurons is called pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons, which receive input from specific clock neurons called DN1. These DN1 neurons can further be subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinctive anterior (DN1a) and posterior (DN1p) clusters. The neuropeptide diuretic hormones 31 (Dh31) and 44 (Dh44) are the insect neuropeptides known to activate PI neurons to control activity rhythms. However, the neurophysiological basis of how Dh31 and Dh44 affect circadian clock neural coding mechanisms underlying sleep in Drosophila is not well understood. Here, we identify Dh31/Dh44-dependent spike time precision and plasticity in PI neurons. We first find that a mixture of Dh31 and Dh44 enhanced the firing of PI neurons, compared to the application of Dh31 alone and Dh44 alone. We next find that the application of synthesized Dh31 and Dh44 affects membrane potential dynamics of PI neurons in the precise timing of the neuronal firing through their synergistic interaction, possibly mediated by calcium-activated potassium channel conductance. Further, we characterize that Dh31/Dh44 enhances postsynaptic potentials in PI neurons. Together, these results suggest multiplexed neuropeptide-dependent spike time precision and plasticity as circadian clock neural coding mechanisms underlying sleep in Drosophila."

Each patient had 4 PRO measures (quality of life SF-12; PROMIS: pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance) at 4 time points (baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12). We included 201 patients without missing values. Participants were 30 years or older and 106 (52.7%) were men, majority were White (164, 81.6%).

We also used attention scores to explain the global variable importance at model level, and at individual level for each patient. The best predictor of pain score was the SF-12 item (physical and emotional health interfere with social activities) and fatigue item (push yourself to get things done), the biggest drug-level contributor was mexiletine, the biggest time-level contributor was week 12. Overall, the model fit well (MAE = 3.7, R2 = 63%).

However, due to shared risk factors, such as advanced age, and tobacco and alcohol use, patients with HNSCC frequently have comorbid illnesses that impact treatment tolerability, adding complexity to treatment-related decision-making. In addition, many patients have medical contraindications to cisplatin, requiring alternative treatment strategies. It is thus important to consider how well patients are likely to tolerate treatment, and how to adapt treatment in response to a patient's condition, when weighing treatment options.

However, the role of COS in resisting the black-shank disease (BSD, caused by P. nicotianae) through regulating plant root exudates and rhizosphere microecology remains unclear. An integrative analysis, based on the transcriptome analysis, root exudate metabolome, and biochemical tests, revealed the secretion of more sugar-related differential metabolites and differential gene expressions expressed under COS treatment during the disease resistance response. Furthermore, increased accumulation of trehalose and trehalose 6-phosphate as well as increased activity of trehalose 6-phosphate synthase was observed under COS treatment after inoculation with P. nicotianae. Additionally, sucrose and glucose, which positively regulate resistance to plant diseases, also exhibited elevated levels. Beneficial microorganisms, such as Bacillus were enriched in the rhizosphere soil during COS treatment. The isolated Bacillus velezensis T-2 strain exerted inhibitory activity on P. nicotianae, which was enhanced by the presence of trehalose. This multi-omics study of transcriptome, metabolome, and microbiomics revealed that COS enhances resistance to tobacco BSD by regulating sugar homeostasis and recruiting beneficial microorganisms."

Given the pace of diagnostic innovation and the potential public health impact, it is timely to review issues in developing useful chest CT screening infrastructure as chest CT screening will soon involve millions of participants worldwide. Lung cancer screening succeeds because it detects curable, early primary lung cancer by characterizing and measuring changes in non-calcified, lung nodules in the size-range from 3mm to 15 mm in diameter. Therefore, close attention to imaging methodology is essential to lung screening success and similar image quality issues are required for reliable quantitative characterization of early emphysema and coronary artery disease.

They showed high conservation in gene structure, with four tandem and six segmental duplications occurred during gene expansion, and various stress and hormone response, light and development-related cis-acting elements identified in their promoters. Transcription analyses demonstrated that they were all constitutively expressed in different organs, and were upregulated by both salt and osmotic stresses. Heterologous expression of CaDREB32 in tobacco restrained the normal growth, but increased the resistance of transgenic plants to salt and osmotic stresses. Further physiochemical analyses revealed that constitutive expression of CaDREB32 increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities, and proline, total soluble sugar and chlorophyll, but decreased malondialdehyde, H"

This study examined subtypes of individuals who use cannabis based on usage characteristics and correlates with other substance consumption and harms. Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey (N = 5,037). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed considering age of onset, use frequency , tobacco consumption, heavy episodic drinking (HED), alcohol use disorder (AUD) and substance use disorder. Logistic regression assessed class correlates, and further analysis compared socio-demographic, health and behavioral indicators. A 4-class model was optimal for 496 individuals. The 'Polydrug' class (26.2%) and the 'Former' class (5.9%) showed earlier onset and highest frequency of cannabis use, with strongest harm associations. 'Polydrug' class had higher odds of other drug use (OR=3.0), tobacco use (OR=2.5), HED (OR=1.8), and AUD (OR=1.5), compared to lighter-use groups. About 30% of those who use cannabis are at increased risk for negative outcomes, particularly those with early, frequent, and polydrug use patterns. Brazil's public health should prioritize targeted prevention on the risks associated with early and frequent cannabis, and polydrug use. Addressing this at-risk group is essential for harm reduction and a health-focused approach."

In this study, it was found that the MsERF105-centered disease-resistant regulatory network was induced by Trichoderma in M. sieversii. The TF-centered yeast one-hybrid indicated that WRKY33 and WRKY40 bound to WBOXATNPR1 elements and GT1 bound to GT1CONSENSUS elements in the promoter of MsERF105 to activate its expression. In addition, the proteins that interacted with MsERF105 were identified by yeast two-hybrid, including FUBP2 and HSP17.8. Furthermore, the candidate target genes of MsERF105 were screened using RNA-Seq, and yeast one-hybrid and tobacco transient transformation further showed MsERF105 bound to GCCBOX elements to regulate the expression of bHLH162, ERF017, NAC83 and NAC104; bound to CCAATBOX elements to regulate the expression of HSFs, HSP70s and HSP20; and bound to ERS elements to regulate the expression of DRPs. Finally, the Trichoderma-induced MsERF105-centered regulatory network of M. sieversii against A. alternata f. sp. mali was built, which provided reliable theoretical guidance for the application of Trichoderma and the disease-resistance breeding of M. sieversii."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Asthma and allergies have emerged as some of the most common chronic diseases, particularly in developed countries. Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that children growing up in farming/rural environments are less likely to develop these conditions. Over the past three decades, China has experienced unprecedented economic development and urbanisation, accompanied by a rapid rise in the prevalence of allergic disorders. Despite the substantial number of affected individuals, allergy management in China remains inconsistent and often inadequate, compounded by variations in diagnostic criteria and limited healthcare access in less developed regions. Furthermore, the vast population, regional disparities, and methodological inconsistencies in data collection have hindered the acquisition of comprehensive, large-scale epidemiological data. This review examines the factors contributing to asthma and allergies from their early origins, focusing on modifiable factors from a specific perspective of China. Factors related to traditional lifestyle, such as early-life exposure to agricultural farming and poultry, diverse dietary patterns, and early introduction of allergenic foods, appear to offer protection against allergies. Conversely, exposure to open-fire cooking, incense burning, tobacco smoke, as well as early-life antibiotic use and perinatal factors like Caesarean section delivery and prematurity may represent potential risks. A clear understanding of the role of these factors would pave the way for developing effective interventions to mitigate the substantial health and socioeconomic burdens associated with asthma and allergies."

        "abstract": "Verticillium wilt is an important disease that seriously affects the quality and yield of cotton. Fungal vascular diseases caused by Verticillium dahliae hinders the sustainable development of cotton cultivation. The most effective strategy for managing Verticillium wilt in cotton involves identifying resistance genes, investigating resistance mechanisms, and developing resistant varieties. In the laboratory, in our previous work, V. dahliae strain Vd080 was inoculated into both disease-resistant and disease-susceptible cotton strains, followed by a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis. The findings confirms the correlation between the gene GhCKA1 and disease resistance. In this study, silencing GhCKA1 expression led to reduced levels of reactive oxygen species, callose, and xylem accumulation, thereby inhibiting various defense responses and reducing cotton resistance to V. dahliae. Furthermore, we observed increased resistance to pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing GhCKA1. Subcellular localization experiments in tobacco indicated that GhCKA1 is localized within the nucleus. GUS staining analysis showed that the expression of the GhCKA1 promoter was influenced by pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, we found that GhCKA1 interacts with aspartic proteases, an important proteolytic enzymes that play significant roles in metabolism and biological regulation. In conclusion, GhCKA1 enhances the resistance of cotton to V. dahliae and interacted with GhAsp1. Therefore, GhCKA1 may be a suitable molecular target to improve the resistance of cotton to Verticillium wilt, and provide a new breeding method for cotton to resist Werticillium wilt."

The study also found that OXT can reduce addictive behavior for certain drugs, including methamphetamine, alcohol, and cocaine, suggesting a close relationship between the OXT system and drug abuse. Although nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco, its interaction with the OXT system is unknown and requires further study. Therefore, OXT levels in plasma and brain regions associated with addiction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using chronic nicotine administration via a slow-release pump. In addition, the effects of OXT injection on nicotine self-administration behavior, motor activity, and intestinal microbiota in rats were examined by nicotine self-administration experiment, open field experiment, and 16S sequencing experiment. By depleting gut microbiota with oral antibiotics, this study aims to investigate whether gut microbiota mediates oxytocin effect on the nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. This study shows that chronic nicotine administration can reduce OXT levels in plasma and brain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and caudate putamen (CPU). OXT at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of nicotine infusions and the abundance of Lactobacillus in rats. Notably, our findings indicate that other mechanisms besides gut microbes are involved in the effect of peripheral OXT administration on the inhibition of nicotine self-administration."

The complete sequencing was achieved by a combination of mass spectrometry coupled with Edman degradation. The amino acid sequence of hortensin 4 matches with that of Atriplex patens type 1 RIP, deduced from the cDNA sequence (AC: ABJ90432.1). The protein consists of 254 amino acid residues, without cysteinyl residues and a N-Acetylhexosamine chain at position Asn231. Structural studies (CD spectrum and 3D model) show a protein core typical of RIPs, and the amino acid residues of active site are conserved. In addition, to get insight into the protective effects of hortensin 4 against pathogens and its putative biotechnological applications, we evaluated the: i) N-glycosylase activity against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA; (ii) antifungal activity towards Trichoderma harzianum and Botrytis cinerea, by damaging fungal ribosomes; and (iii) inhibition of human primary glioblastoma NULU cells proliferation, with cytotoxicity enhanced in the presence of temozolomide, used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Altogether, the multiple biological activities of hortensin 4 could be exploited both to improve the resistance to various pathogens by engineering transgenic plants and to develop useful tools for cancer therapy."

After decades of decline, driven by decreases in combusted tobacco use, nicotine product use has increased due to electronic nicotine delivery systems, also known as e-cigarettes or vapes. Preclinical models of nicotine self-administration can serve as important lodestars in the search for effective intervention and prevention tactics. Current variants of the preclinical models have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the rodent electronic nicotine delivery system (RENDS), a novel low-cost nonproprietary nose-only preclinical model of nicotine aerosol self-administration. We confirmed that RENDS sequesters nicotine aerosol in the nose port by measuring fine particulate matter (PM <2.5 microns) generated by e-cigarettes. We also showed that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is relatively low in cost. Four existing operant chambers can be retrofitted with the RENDS for less than $325/chamber. All RENDS diagrams and plans for custom-designed components are on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/x2pqf/?view_only=775b55435b8e428f98e6da384ef7889d)."

        "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been increasingly used to treat psychiatric disorders, including tobacco use disorder. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of rTMS in smoking cessation and to explore the underlying neural mechanism of the treatment effect. In Experiment 1, we recruited 60 participants who smoked cigarettes and 60 healthy controls and used their baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labelling perfusion to determine the group-level difference in CBF. In Experiment 2, we used the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as the target for subsequent 5-day rTMS treatment at a frequency of 10 Hz with 2000 pulses to observe the impact of rTMS on CBF, Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, we measured functional connectivity to monitor the functional changes induced by rTMS and assessed their associations with smoking cravings and nicotine dependence scores. In Experiment 1, participants who smoked cigarettes presented significantly higher CBF in the left DLPFC and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex than healthy controls. In Experiment 2, rTMS significantly decreased CBF in the DLPFC and reduced Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, rTMS increased functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right DLPFC, bilateral precuneus and bilateral parahippocampus in participants, who smoked cigarettes. Regional CBF is a tool to identify tobacco use disorder-related regional brain markers and targets for reducing nicotine dependence and smoking cravings through rTMS. A neural mechanism of left DLPFC rTMS may involve a reduction in CBF in the target area and an increase in functional connectivity between the target area and the DLPFC-striatal pathways."

Nicotine smoking can also cause complications for patients undergoing medical procedures. The prevalence of vaping among young people has added a significant challenge to the health care systems as many commercial vaping oils contain undeclared nicotine content, thus leading to nicotine addiction. Governments around the world criminalised the undeclared presence of nicotine in vaping oils. Therefore, there a is strong demand for new materials and sensors that can rapidly detect nicotine/tobacco smoke in vaping products and the environment. Similarly, there is an ongoing need for rapid methods to determine the concentration of the nicotine metabolite, cotinine, in patients prior to medical procedures. To address these needs, we have synthesised and utilised a cost-effective paper sensor for the rapid screening of nicotine and cotinine in vaping the oil, the gas phase, and the human saliva by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The new sensor can detect ultra traces of nicotine and cotinine down to 1 pg/mL and 1 ng/mL respectively, within 20 min. The new sensor can be recycled for repeated screening of nicotine and its metabolite, thus maximizing its economic viability. The was successfully utilised for the detection of nicotine in tobacco smoke and in spiked human saliva by a handheld Raman spectrometer, thus indicating its potential for real-life applications."

Motivations: \"Know the potential enemy at an individual level\". Smoking or vaping produces an initial \"bolus\" of nicotine in the blood and brain, lasting ~5 min with a peak concentration of ~ 100-200 nM. The bolus largely governs reinforcement, reward, and cognitive enhancement. A prolonged declining phase of [nicotine], with a half-time of 1 to 4 h, largely suppresses withdrawal symptoms and governs the known cell biology of addiction. Next, \"Know the potential therapy\", because individual [nicotine]t records will be useful during research on the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy. Finally, \"Know the physiology\". The only three known effects on nAChRs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the relevant [nicotine]t are activation, desensitization, and chaperoning/upregulation. Therefore, additional mechanistic insights will arise from correlating [nicotine]t with readily measurable physiological data on those effects in molecular, cellular, and brain slice systems and animal models. Interstitial fluid is the appropriate compartment for a CNM. The molecular sensor technology could employ fluorescence, as shown by progress on measuring [nicotine]t with improved variants of intensity-based nicotine-sensing fluorescent reporters (iNicSnFRs). Electrochemical measurements of [nicotine]t may also be possible. Studies like Population Assessment of Tobacco Health would contextualize [nicotine]t measurements during each subject's ad libitum nicotine intake, hopefully at a cost < $100 for a 24-hour record. The collaborative research agenda culminating in a CNM must use public funding."

To study their respiratory health effects, there is the issue of heterogenous patterns of use: concurrently with cigarette smoking (dual use), exclusive use after smoking cessation (exclusive use), or use initiated without any prior or current use of cigarettes (naïve use). Our primary goal was to synthesize the evidence on the respiratory effects of ECs use in adults, categorized by their pattern of use. Additionally, we identified the highest quality systematic reviews and critically evaluated the current literature on this topic. The review was developed with published umbrella review guidelines. The database searches were Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, LILACS, and grey literature databases. The criterion for inclusion of systematic reviews was analyses of respiratory tests from randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. Quality assessments were performed with AMSTAR2 and a checklist of reporting biases. A narrative analysis was synthesized by test method: spirometry, impulse oscillometry, breath gasses, biomarkers, and clinical serious adverse events. Twelve systematic reviews were included. The findings on respiratory functioning were statistically non-significant across all patterns of use. Reporting bias was frequently observed. Based on the current research, there is no evidence of significant change in the short or medium term in respiratory function with any pattern of ECs use. We attribute the null findings to the weaknesses of acute studies, the participants' smoking history masking testing, and the inclusion of participants with a low frequency of use."

The effects of smoking classic cigarettes on human health have been thoroughly described in the literature, but the negative health effects of e-cigarettes and HTPs on the human body are not clearly defined. Among users of different forms of tobacco, those at a particularly high risk of developing particular disease entities should be identified, allowing for the faster implementation of potential treatments, including psychotherapeutic ones. Biomarkers are used for this purpose. This paper summarizes the potential of these compounds from the different exposure groups of classic cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and HTPs, and presents changes in their concentrations in the body fluids of different tobacco users. This review discusses the impact of tobacco use in relation to levels of the following biomarkers: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-4, Il-13, TGF-β, VEGF EGF, HGF, BDNF, MMP-9, CRP, microplastics, and selected parameters of oxidative stress.

This study aimed to analyze the age of smoking initiation and its sociodemographic determinants among Iranian adults, based on data from the 2021 STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) survey, to inform targeted public health interventions. The analysis of 27,874 adults revealed that the average initiation ages for cigarette and hookah smoking were 22.2 years and 24.9 years, respectively. Men typically began smoking earlier than women, with average ages of 21.9 years for males and 27.7 years for females. No significant differences were observed in smoking initiation ages between rural and urban areas. Education level and marital status were also influential, with the youngest initiators having 7-12 years of education and being single. This study highlights the significant roles of gender, education, and urban-rural differences in smoking initiation in Iran. The findings underscore the need for targeted public health strategies conforming to the WHO's MPOWER initiatives and the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Increased investment in public health, focusing on education and preventive measures, is crucial to reduce early smoking initiation and its associated health risks, ultimately supporting broader health policy goals."

        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is mostly caused by stenotic atherosclerotic lesions of lower limb arteries. Intermittent claudication is the most common manifestation, while, in more advanced stages of the disease, chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) occurs. Optimal medical therapy is an essential cornerstone in all stages of PAD, while endovascular and open surgical revascularisation are of great importance - depending on the patient and lesion characteristics and can be used in a complementary manner. In patients with claudication, the improvement in the pain-free walking distance is the primary therapeutic goal, while, in patients with CLTI, amputation-free survival is most important. In both patient groups, there is a need for strict control of cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure and diabetes control, nicotine abstinence and reduction in cholesterol levels using intensive statin therapy, in accordance with national and international guidelines. Endovascular treatment of PAD is used widely and by various specialist disciplines. However, conventional endovascular therapy procedures have limitations in complex and heavily calcified lesions, so that, for example, classic balloon angioplasty in such lesions is associated with \"recoil\" and/or severe dissections, which usually require the placement of permanent metallic implants. Lesion preparation procedures, such as atherectomy and intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) can improve compliance of calcified arteries, by either creating microfractures at calcified sites or removing calcified material. In this way, balloon angioplasty can be performed with less barotrauma and the need for stent implantation can be reduced, while subsequent treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB) is associated with potentially improved penetration of the drug into the vessel wall, and thus increases the effectiveness of the procedure by enhancing anti-restenotic effects. In this manuscript, the potential - but also the limitations - of different lesion preparation strategies are presented and discussed."

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide, and numerous studies have indicated that exposure to addictive substances, such as opioids, cocaine, etc., can result in decreased function of the OXT system. The study also found that OXT can reduce addictive behavior for certain drugs, including methamphetamine, alcohol, and cocaine, suggesting a close relationship between the OXT system and drug abuse. Although nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco, its interaction with the OXT system is unknown and requires further study. Therefore, OXT levels in plasma and brain regions associated with addiction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using chronic nicotine administration via a slow-release pump. In addition, the effects of OXT injection on nicotine self-administration behavior, motor activity, and intestinal microbiota in rats were examined by nicotine self-administration experiment, open field experiment, and 16S sequencing experiment. By depleting gut microbiota with oral antibiotics, this study aims to investigate whether gut microbiota mediates oxytocin effect on the nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. This study shows that chronic nicotine administration can reduce OXT levels in plasma and brain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and caudate putamen (CPU). OXT at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of nicotine infusions and the abundance of Lactobacillus in rats. Notably, our findings indicate that other mechanisms besides gut microbes are involved in the effect of peripheral OXT administration on the inhibition of nicotine self-administration."

        "abstract": "Tobacco use is the leading cause of death globally and in the United States. After decades of decline, driven by decreases in combusted tobacco use, nicotine product use has increased due to electronic nicotine delivery systems, also known as e-cigarettes or vapes. Preclinical models of nicotine self-administration can serve as important lodestars in the search for effective intervention and prevention tactics. Current variants of the preclinical models have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the rodent electronic nicotine delivery system (RENDS), a novel low-cost nonproprietary nose-only preclinical model of nicotine aerosol self-administration. We confirmed that RENDS sequesters nicotine aerosol in the nose port by measuring fine particulate matter (PM <2.5 microns) generated by e-cigarettes. We also showed that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is relatively low in cost. Four existing operant chambers can be retrofitted with the RENDS for less than $325/chamber. All RENDS diagrams and plans for custom-designed components are on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/x2pqf/?view_only=775b55435b8e428f98e6da384ef7889d)."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of rTMS in smoking cessation and to explore the underlying neural mechanism of the treatment effect. In Experiment 1, we recruited 60 participants who smoked cigarettes and 60 healthy controls and used their baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labelling perfusion to determine the group-level difference in CBF. In Experiment 2, we used the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as the target for subsequent 5-day rTMS treatment at a frequency of 10 Hz with 2000 pulses to observe the impact of rTMS on CBF, Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, we measured functional connectivity to monitor the functional changes induced by rTMS and assessed their associations with smoking cravings and nicotine dependence scores. In Experiment 1, participants who smoked cigarettes presented significantly higher CBF in the left DLPFC and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex than healthy controls. In Experiment 2, rTMS significantly decreased CBF in the DLPFC and reduced Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, rTMS increased functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right DLPFC, bilateral precuneus and bilateral parahippocampus in participants, who smoked cigarettes. Regional CBF is a tool to identify tobacco use disorder-related regional brain markers and targets for reducing nicotine dependence and smoking cravings through rTMS. A neural mechanism of left DLPFC rTMS may involve a reduction in CBF in the target area and an increase in functional connectivity between the target area and the DLPFC-striatal pathways."

However, the relative contributions and potential interdependencies of these brain imaging-derived phenotypes in the context of craving and nicotine dependence are unclear. Moreover, it is unknown whether these relationships differ in individuals who smoke versus vape nicotine. To investigate these questions, eighty-six individuals who use nicotine daily (n = 67 smoking, n = 19 vaping) completed either a smoking or vaping cue-reactivity task and a resting-state scan during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Validating the efficacy of the smoking and vaping tasks, both cohorts displayed robust reactivity to nicotine versus neutral cues in the default mode network (DMN) and the anterior insula (AI), a primary node of the salience network (SN), which did not habituate over time. In the smoking and vaping groups, lower prefrontal reactivity to nicotine versus neutral cues and greater resting-state FC between nodes of the SN and DMN were associated with higher cue-induced craving. Moreover, we found that the former partially mediated the latter, suggesting a mechanism in which high resting SN-DMN connectivity increases craving susceptibility partly via a constraining effect on regulatory prefrontal reactivity to cues. These relationships were not impacted by group, suggesting that links between brain function and craving are similar regardless of smoking or vaping nicotine."

We previously demonstrated that Arvcf was associated significantly with nicotine and alcohol addiction through genome-wide association studies. However, the role and mechanisms of Arvcf in dopamine-mediated drug reward processes were largely unknown. In this study, we first showed that Arvcf mediates nicotine-induced reward behavior by using conditioned place preference (CPP) model on Arvcf-knockout (Arvcf-KO) animal model. Then, we revealed that Arvcf was mainly expressed in VTA dopaminergic neurons whose expression could be upregulated by nicotine treatment. Subsequently, our SnRNA-seq analysis revealed that Arvcf was directly involved in dopamine biosynthesis in VTA dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, we found that Arvcf-KO led to a significant reduction in both the dopamine synthesis and release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on nicotine stimulation. Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of Arvcf in VTA dopaminergic neurons decreased dopamine release within VTA-NAc circuit and suppressed nicotine reward-related behavior, while overexpression of Arvcf led to the opposite results. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of Arvcf in regulating dopamine signaling and reward learning, and its enhancement of dopamine release in the VTA-NAc circuit as a novel mechanism for nicotine reward."

The current study investigates the role of psychological distress as a key factor in disrupting decision-making processes in the context of substance and behavioral addictions. A large community sample (N = 668) completed a gamified two-stage task to investigate the link between model-free (habitual) task behavior and a wide range of addictive behaviors. Addictive behaviors included substance use (alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drug use) and behavioral addictions (problematic use of the internet, addictive eating, shopping, and gambling). The relationship between habitual task behavior and addictive engagement was investigated using structural equation modelling with a bifactor latent variable structure, which was modeled and tested; one for substance use and one for behavioral addictions. For participants with higher levels of psychological distress, greater habitual task behavior was a significant predictor of behavioral addiction risk (β = -0.188, SE = 2.061, p = .016), specifically problematic use of the internet (β = -0.148, SE = 0.045, p = .018) and eating behaviors (β = -0.191, SE = 0.016, p < .001). These findings support our proposition that psychological distress disrupts cognitive control, leading to a greater reliance on habitual decision-making and non-substance addictive behaviors. This highlights the potential importance of habit-based interventions in combination with stress-reduction and mental health-promoting techniques to improve outcomes and minimize harm, especially in the context of behavioral addictions."

Nicotine smoking can also cause complications for patients undergoing medical procedures. The prevalence of vaping among young people has added a significant challenge to the health care systems as many commercial vaping oils contain undeclared nicotine content, thus leading to nicotine addiction. Governments around the world criminalised the undeclared presence of nicotine in vaping oils. Therefore, there a is strong demand for new materials and sensors that can rapidly detect nicotine/tobacco smoke in vaping products and the environment. Similarly, there is an ongoing need for rapid methods to determine the concentration of the nicotine metabolite, cotinine, in patients prior to medical procedures. To address these needs, we have synthesised and utilised a cost-effective paper sensor for the rapid screening of nicotine and cotinine in vaping the oil, the gas phase, and the human saliva by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The new sensor can detect ultra traces of nicotine and cotinine down to 1 pg/mL and 1 ng/mL respectively, within 20 min. The new sensor can be recycled for repeated screening of nicotine and its metabolite, thus maximizing its economic viability. The was successfully utilised for the detection of nicotine in tobacco smoke and in spiked human saliva by a handheld Raman spectrometer, thus indicating its potential for real-life applications."

Motivations: \"Know the potential enemy at an individual level\". Smoking or vaping produces an initial \"bolus\" of nicotine in the blood and brain, lasting ~5 min with a peak concentration of ~ 100-200 nM. The bolus largely governs reinforcement, reward, and cognitive enhancement. A prolonged declining phase of [nicotine], with a half-time of 1 to 4 h, largely suppresses withdrawal symptoms and governs the known cell biology of addiction. Next, \"Know the potential therapy\", because individual [nicotine]t records will be useful during research on the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy. Finally, \"Know the physiology\". The only three known effects on nAChRs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the relevant [nicotine]t are activation, desensitization, and chaperoning/upregulation. Therefore, additional mechanistic insights will arise from correlating [nicotine]t with readily measurable physiological data on those effects in molecular, cellular, and brain slice systems and animal models. Interstitial fluid is the appropriate compartment for a CNM. The molecular sensor technology could employ fluorescence, as shown by progress on measuring [nicotine]t with improved variants of intensity-based nicotine-sensing fluorescent reporters (iNicSnFRs). Electrochemical measurements of [nicotine]t may also be possible. Studies like Population Assessment of Tobacco Health would contextualize [nicotine]t measurements during each subject's ad libitum nicotine intake, hopefully at a cost < $100 for a 24-hour record. The collaborative research agenda culminating in a CNM must use public funding."

Our primary goal was to synthesize the evidence on the respiratory effects of ECs use in adults, categorized by their pattern of use. Additionally, we identified the highest quality systematic reviews and critically evaluated the current literature on this topic. The review was developed with published umbrella review guidelines. The database searches were Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, LILACS, and grey literature databases. The criterion for inclusion of systematic reviews was analyses of respiratory tests from randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. Quality assessments were performed with AMSTAR2 and a checklist of reporting biases. A narrative analysis was synthesized by test method: spirometry, impulse oscillometry, breath gasses, biomarkers, and clinical serious adverse events. Twelve systematic reviews were included. The findings on respiratory functioning were statistically non-significant across all patterns of use. Reporting bias was frequently observed. Based on the current research, there is no evidence of significant change in the short or medium term in respiratory function with any pattern of ECs use. We attribute the null findings to the weaknesses of acute studies, the participants' smoking history masking testing, and the inclusion of participants with a low frequency of use."

The present study evaluated associations between area-based SES and epigenetic age as assessed by the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge epigenetic clocks in a national sample of older non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic participants. The present study used epigenetic age data from 3790 participants in the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study and census tract SES data from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Four epigenetic clocks were regressed on area-based SES, adjusting for age, sex, and educational attainment. Although area-based SES was not significantly associated with Horvath or Hannum clocks, living in lower SES census tracts was associated with older PhenoAge and GrimAge. After considering smoking status, however, only the association with GrimAge remained. Investigating interactions with race/ethnicity suggested that area-based SES was more strongly associated with accelerated Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge among non-Hispanic White participants than for other racial/ethnic groups. These racial/ethnic differences were completely reduced, however, in models that included smoking status. The present results illuminated racially/ethnically distinct patterns of biological (epigenetic aging) and behavioral (smoking) risk for poor health, and suggested that ameliorating low area-based SES may be beneficial for racially/ethnically diverse populations."

        "abstract": "Fire disasters pose significant risks to human life, economic development, and social stability. The early stages of a fire, often characterized by small flames, diffuse smoke, and obstructed objects, can lead to challenges such as missed detections and poor real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a DSS-YOLO model based on an improved YOLOv8n architecture, designed to enhance the recognition accuracy of obscured objects and small targets while reducing computational overhead. Specifically, we replace all C2f modules in the Backbone with DynamicConv modules to reduce computation without sacrificing feature extraction capabilities. We also introduce the SEAM attention mechanism to improve detection of obscured and small targets, and the SPPELAN module at the end of the Backbone to enhance detection across different scales. The model is evaluated using the public dataset mytest-hrswj, which contains diverse fire scenarios, including indoors, forests, and buildings. Compared with the original YOLOv8n, the DSS-YOLOv8 model proposed in this paper improves mAP by 0.6% and Recall by 1.6%, while reducing the model size and FLOPs by 3.4% and 12.3% respectively. The results of this study provide effective technical support for intelligent fire monitoring systems, significantly reducing the computational cost of the model. It enhances real-time fire detection capabilities in complex fire scenarios, facilitating the early detection of fire hazards and helping to minimize the damage caused by fires."

Given the scarcity of regional data on congenital anomalies, this research furthers the understanding of localised health risks and could inform targeted interventions. A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted involving 40,000 newborns born between December 2019 and June 2024. Data were collected from medical records and parental interviews at one of the main hospitals in the Ha'il Region. Anomalies were categorised and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Forty-seven cases (0.146%) of oral and maxillofacial anomalies were identified, with a higher prevalence seen in female newborns. Relationship were found between these anomalies and parental smoking, socioeconomic status, and parental health history. Anomalies, such as cleft lips and palates, were more frequent in females, while other conditions, like the eruption of chlorodontia, were exclusive to males. This study underscores the importance of addressing environmental and socioeconomic factors to prevent congenital anomalies. These findings provide crucial data for healthcare planning in the Ha'il Region, aligning with Saudi's Vision 2030 objectives related to improving neonatal and maternal care."

Based on the 2023 definition, MASLD is characterized by the presence of metabolic dysfunction and limited alcohol consumption (<140 grams/week for women, <210 grams/week for men). Given the significant burden of MASLD in Latin America, this guidance was developed by the Latin American Association for the Study of the Liver (ALEH) Working Group to address key aspects of its clinical assessment and therapeutic strategies. In Latin America, ultrasonography is recommended as the initial screening tool for hepatic steatosis due to its accessibility, while Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) is preferred for fibrosis risk stratification, with further evaluation using more specific techniques (i.e., vibration-controlled transient elastography or Enhanced Liver Fibrosis [ELF] test). A Mediterranean diet is advised for all MASLD patients, with a target of 7-10% weight loss for those with excess weight. Complete alcohol abstinence is recommended for patients with significant fibrosis, and smoking cessation is encouraged regardless of fibrosis stage. Pharmacological options should be tailored based on the presence of steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, excess weight, and diabetes, including resmetirom, incretin-based therapies, pioglitazone, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Bariatric surgery may be considered for MASLD patients with obesity unresponsive to lifestyle and medical interventions. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening is advised for all cirrhotic patients, with consideration given to those with advanced fibrosis based on individual risk. Finally, routine cardiovascular risk assessment and proper diabetes prevention and management remain crucial for all patients with MASLD."

Indeed, CR has been shown to improve exercise capacity, control of cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, hospital readmission, and mortality rates. Nonetheless, pre- and clinical CR and exercise training models are an enormous source of potential beneficial mechanisms that can be exploited for cardiac disease therapy. Consequently, in this review, we aim to explore the unique benefits of CR in HF and coronary artery disease, focusing on the epigenetic mechanisms involved and their translational relevance. These mechanisms may represent novel therapeutic targets to promote functional recovery after cardiac injury, and non-coding RNAs could be predictive biomarkers for CR success in patients."

However, it is only in the last two decades that combined oncological and neuroscientific research has allowed to explore this relationship in an exact way and to describe the pathways and mechanisms that mediate the stimulatory effect of stress on cancer. This adverse effect of stress is mediated mainly by the mediators of the sympathoadrenal system, norepinephrine and epinephrine, which, by activating adrenergic receptors in the tumor micro- and macro-environment, stimulate tumor cell proliferation and neoangiogenesis and inhibit antitumor immunity, reducing the efficacy of standard anticancer therapies. It has also been found that interventions reducing the effects of stress on the body not only improve the quality of life of cancer patients but may also improve their survival. Given the complexity of the impact of stress on the organism, experimental and clinical studies have overwhelmingly focused on investigating the effect of a single intervention reducing the stimulatory influence of the sympathoadrenal system on the cancer process."

Given the pace of diagnostic innovation and the potential public health impact, it is timely to review issues in developing useful chest CT screening infrastructure as chest CT screening will soon involve millions of participants worldwide. Lung cancer screening succeeds because it detects curable, early primary lung cancer by characterizing and measuring changes in non-calcified, lung nodules in the size-range from 3mm to 15 mm in diameter.

The effects of smoking classic cigarettes on human health have been thoroughly described in the literature, but the negative health effects of e-cigarettes and HTPs on the human body are not clearly defined. Among users of different forms of tobacco, those at a particularly high risk of developing particular disease entities should be identified, allowing for the faster implementation of potential treatments, including psychotherapeutic ones. Biomarkers are used for this purpose. This paper summarizes the potential of these compounds from the different exposure groups of classic cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and HTPs, and presents changes in their concentrations in the body fluids of different tobacco users. This review discusses the impact of tobacco use in relation to levels of the following biomarkers: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-4, Il-13, TGF-β, VEGF EGF, HGF, BDNF, MMP-9, CRP, microplastics, and selected parameters of oxidative stress.

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Tobacco smoking involves the use of devices such as pipes, cigars, or cigarettes to inhale and exhale smoke from burning tobacco leaves, primarily to ingest nicotine and other substances. The impact of oxidative stress from smoking on periodontitis and its underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. Previous research has shown that smoking activates oxidative stress responses, generating harmful oxidative substances and free radicals that induce periodontitis. Although traditionally recognized as a key pathway, recent studies suggest additional mechanisms are involved. The study aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on periodontitis induced by oxidative stress from smoking, exploring potential mechanisms involving microorganisms, inflammation, immunity, cellular responses, and saliva. The primary objective is to compare and elucidate the various mechanisms by which traditional tobacco smoke and electronic cigarettes induce oxidative stress and lead to periodontitis and summarize the similarities or differences between the two. In addition, this article explores the different effects of smoking on oxidative stress and periodontitis under different conditions of nicotine presence and nicotine content. This comprehensive review contributes to our evolving understanding of how traditional tobacco smoke and electronic cigarettes affect periodontitis through different pathways and components, emphasizing that oxidative stress is an important factor in smoking-induced periodontitis. The insights gained from this study may help develop targeted interventions for the different pathways of the impact of traditional tobacco smoke and electronic cigarettes in clinical practice, to prevent or treat smoking-induced periodontitis and ultimately safeguard public oral health."

To understand their relative toxicities, mainstream smoke yields of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a human carcinogen, were measured for 60 commercial little cigars. The little cigars were smoked on a linear smoking machine using the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) nonintense and Canadian Intense (CI) smoking regimens followed by analysis with a validated gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The average analytical quantitative variability of the measured little cigar constituents was lower compared to previously tested commercial cigarettes (%RSD 9.6 vs 14.5, respectively).

Thus, this study aims to investigate the adverse effects of 1-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-4-butanal (NNA), a special component in THS, on testis. Herein, adult ICR mice were orally administered diluted dimethylsulfoxide (control), 0.075 μg/kg and 0.15 μg/kg NNA for 10 weeks. The findings revealed that NNA exposure, especially in 0.15 μg/kg dosage, significantly reduced the epithelium height and tubular area within the testis. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that NNA exposure interfered with the expression of genes associated with oxygen transport and oxygen binding processes, such as Hbb-bs, the downregulation of which also led to oxidative damage. Additionally, NNA exposure induced oxidative damage in testis by decreased levels of SOD and GSH enzymes, along with an increase in MDA level. In summary, our results demonstrate that NNA exposure causes impaired testicular structure and oxidative damage, indicating its testicular toxicity. This finding not only implies the detrimental effect of NNA on male reproduction, but also provides a fundamental basis for further research on the impact of THS exposure on male reproductive health."

However, the understanding of how MP properties influence ARG prevalence in mariculture sediments remains limited. Herein, the polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs with different sizes (20-120 μm and 0.5-2.0 mm) were selected to evaluate their impacts and underlying mechanisms driving ARGs dissemination. The results showed that PS and PVC MPs increased the relative abundance of ARGs by 1.41-2.50-fold and 2.01-2.84-fold, respectively, compared with control, particularly high-risk genes. The polymer type effect was identified as more influential than the size effect in driving the sediment resistome evolution. PVC shifted the microbial community assembly from stochastic to deterministic processes, thus enriching ARG host pathogens. Furthermore, the highly hydrophobic PS not only recruited the host bacteria colonization but also facilitated ARG exchange within the plastisphere. The exogenous additives released by PVC (e.g., heavy metals, bisphenol A, and tridecyl ester) and the particles synergistically promoted ARG conjugative transfer by inducing oxidative stress and enhancing cell membrane permeability. These findings revealed how MPs characteristics facilitated the spread of ARGs in marine benthic ecosystems, underscoring the importance of mitigating MPs pollution to maintain mariculture ecosystem health, prevent zoonotic diseases, and balance global mariculture with ecological health."

This review includes preclinical and clinical findings throughout all periods of development and adulthood. Selective attention is directly impacted by cannabis use, while reaction time is dependent on the timing of the last cannabis exposure. Among individuals who use cannabis, there is an attentional bias that reduces anxiety and increases focus on cannabis-related cues. Preclinical studies show that cannabis induces attention deficits that persist even after an abstinence period. Preclinical and clinical studies of prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) provide evidence that offspring will have an increased risk for drug-seeking behavior, attention deficits, and impulsivity, which may lead to attentional disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. Nicotine has a dose-dependent effect on attention in adults, though preclinical studies have shown mixed results, possibly due to differences in experimental design. Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) impairs attentional networks by increasing one's risk for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Additionally, maternal secondhand smoke exposure is linked to ADHD/conduct disorder risk in offspring. Preclinical studies on prenatal nicotine exposure suggest that there may be sex differences in which males are affected more so than females with PNE. Summary: Overall, cannabis/THC impairs attention, and nicotine enhances attention; however, both substances impair attention when individuals are exposed prenatally."

        "abstract": "The ageing process is a multifaceted phenomenon that affects individuals' physical, cognitive, and psychological well-being over time. To promote healthy ageing, in the mid-2010s, the World Health Organisation introduced the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC) as the set of physical and mental capacities of an individual. These capacities, categorised into five domains, namely cognition, vitality, locomotion, psychological well-being, and sensory, are assessed by healthcare practitioners using the ICOPE guidelines, a laborious and time-consuming task. This study leverages existing data from longitudinal studies, such as the well-known Health and Retirement Study, to align their dimensions with the ICOPE framework and understand how existing ageing trajectories fit within the new IC paradigm. Moreover, a novel IC scoring system has been validated statistically using linear mixed models, and a simple yet comprehensive data visualisation strategy has been designed to illustrate IC trajectories. Results show the significant negative impact of time on all IC domains, except psychological well-being, showing a gradual IC decline over the years. Additionally, significant associations between lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and body mass index, with IC trajectories have been identified. This work suggests the feasibility of using existing longitudinal studies to quantitatively model IC ageing trajectories following the ICOPE framework."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of intermittent high-dose radon exposure on lung epithelial cells, analyze protein profiles and identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis of radon-related lung cancer. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to radon (1000 Bq/m3) for 30 min daily for 7 days. Cell viability was measured using the WST-1 assay, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomic analysis was performed. Differentially expressed proteins and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were analyzed. Our findings showed that intermittent high-radon exposure reduced A549 cell viability over time. Proteomic analysis identified proteins associated with stressed-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial adaptation, nuclear integrity and lysosomal degradation. These proteins are related to catabolism, stress response, gene expression and metabolic processes in the biological process of GO analysis. We highlighted specific proteins, including AKR1B1, CDK2, DAPK1, PRDX1 and ALHD2 with potential as biomarkers for radon-related lung cancer. In summary, intermittent high-dose radon exposure affects cellular adaptions of lung epithelial cells including stress-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunctions and immune regulation. The identified proteins may serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for radon-related lung cancer."

However, the relative contributions and potential interdependencies of these brain imaging-derived phenotypes in the context of craving and nicotine dependence are unclear. Moreover, it is unknown whether these relationships differ in individuals who smoke versus vape nicotine. To investigate these questions, eighty-six individuals who use nicotine daily (n = 67 smoking, n = 19 vaping) completed either a smoking or vaping cue-reactivity task and a resting-state scan during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Validating the efficacy of the smoking and vaping tasks, both cohorts displayed robust reactivity to nicotine versus neutral cues in the default mode network (DMN) and the anterior insula (AI), a primary node of the salience network (SN), which did not habituate over time. In the smoking and vaping groups, lower prefrontal reactivity to nicotine versus neutral cues and greater resting-state FC between nodes of the SN and DMN were associated with higher cue-induced craving. Moreover, we found that the former partially mediated the latter, suggesting a mechanism in which high resting SN-DMN connectivity increases craving susceptibility partly via a constraining effect on regulatory prefrontal reactivity to cues. These relationships were not impacted by group, suggesting that links between brain function and craving are similar regardless of smoking or vaping nicotine."

        "abstract": "The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection persist months and years after recovery. We conducted an online survey to assess the health condition of convalescents approximately 5 months following the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2. The study recruited 5,510 individuals who were primary infected, 626 participants who had experienced reinfection, and 521 participants who were without infective history. The most common disorders after the primary infection group were fatigue (15.18 %), memory issue (13.13 %), post-exertional malaise (PEM, 11.68 %), and brain fog (11.29 %) at the time of survey. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection had an impact on the reproductive systems. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, smoking currently, with background diseases, and outpatient visits in the acute phase could be associated with moderate / severe disorders. Further analysis of different background diseases showed that allergic rhinitis, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases, and asthma likely increased the risk of moderate/severe disorders. The probability of developing disorders of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was higher before the secondary infection than uninfected people. Fatigue, PEM, muscle pain/spasms, chills, joint pain, excessive sweating at rest, headache / dizziness, sore throat or foreign body sensation in the throat, cough, expectoration, dry / painful / watery eyes, loss of appetite and constipation were associated with an increased risk of reinfection. It was essential to undertake further research with enhanced randomization in a larger sample in the community, and to strengthen the validation of the research conclusions. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the health recovery process among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents. Moreover, the findings help identify characteristic health risk factors associated with convalescents and highlight the risk of moderate / severe disorders and reinfection. Furthermore, the findings also provide valuable guidance and reference for SARS-CoV-2 rehabilitation strategies and the prevention of reinfection, offering insights for scientific recommendations."

The effects of smoking classic cigarettes on human health have been thoroughly described in the literature, but the negative health effects of e-cigarettes and HTPs on the human body are not clearly defined. Among users of different forms of tobacco, those at a particularly high risk of developing particular disease entities should be identified, allowing for the faster implementation of potential treatments, including psychotherapeutic ones. Biomarkers are used for this purpose. This paper summarizes the potential of these compounds from the different exposure groups of classic cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and HTPs, and presents changes in their concentrations in the body fluids of different tobacco users. This review discusses the impact of tobacco use in relation to levels of the following biomarkers: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-4, Il-13, TGF-β, VEGF EGF, HGF, BDNF, MMP-9, CRP, microplastics, and selected parameters of oxidative stress. This review also includes suggested forms of treatment, including Tobacco Product Use Reduction Programs, to minimize the potential negative effects of the above-mentioned products."

It has been reported that radon induces deoxyribonucleic acid damage and oxidative stress in cells. However, the protein profile and potential biomarkers for early detection of radon-induced lung cancer remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of intermittent high-dose radon exposure on lung epithelial cells, analyze protein profiles and identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis of radon-related lung cancer. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to radon (1000 Bq/m3) for 30 min daily for 7 days. Cell viability was measured using the WST-1 assay, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomic analysis was performed. Differentially expressed proteins and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were analyzed. Our findings showed that intermittent high-radon exposure reduced A549 cell viability over time. Proteomic analysis identified proteins associated with stressed-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial adaptation, nuclear integrity and lysosomal degradation. These proteins are related to catabolism, stress response, gene expression and metabolic processes in the biological process of GO analysis. We highlighted specific proteins, including AKR1B1, CDK2, DAPK1, PRDX1 and ALHD2 with potential as biomarkers for radon-related lung cancer. In summary, intermittent high-dose radon exposure affects cellular adaptions of lung epithelial cells including stress-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunctions and immune regulation. The identified proteins may serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for radon-related lung cancer."

BPV is defined as short-term (24-h), medium or long- term (weeks, months or years). Standard deviation, coefficient of variation and variation independent of the mean have been used to quantify BPV. High BPV is associated with increasing age, diabetes, smoking and vascular disease and is a consequence of premature ageing of the vasculature. Long-term BPV has been incorporated into cardiovascular risk models (QRISK) and elevated BPV confers an increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes even in subjects with controlled blood pressure. Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics are the only drugs that reduce BPV and for the former explains their beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes. We believe that BPV should be incorporated into blood pressure management guidelines and based on current evidence, long-acting dihydropyridines should be preferred drugs in subjects with elevated BPV."

This study aims to weigh out the diverse impact of multiple risk factors on LCM rates and identify trends in LCM rates worldwide. We initially employed Random Forest Tree (RFT) and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) to identify common primary factors influencing LCM. After eliminating four common primary factors, a comparative analysis between partial and Pearson correlations was conducted to filter out significant factors in the correlations between risk factors and LCM rates across 204 countries from 2005 to 2019. The findings show that excluding the impacts of occupational exposure to arsenic, smoking, residential radon, occupational exposure to silica, occupational exposure to asbestos, high systolic blood pressure, secondhand smoke, child wasting, and alcohol use had a considerably greater impact on LCM than particular matter pollution (PM2.5). Furthermore, a Multiple Joinpoint Regression analysis identified increasing trends of LCM rates in the 142 countries (e.g., China and India); decreasing trends in 38 countries (e.g., Denmark and Norway), and stable trends in 24 countries (e.g., Sudan, Mali, and Australia). This research suggests that in addition to considering the effects of occupational exposure to arsenic, smoking, residential radon, and occupational exposure to silica on LCM rates, occupational exposure to asbestos, high systolic blood pressure, secondhand smoke, child wasting, and alcohol use should be considered in lung cancer prevention strategies, especially in countries with increasing trends of LCM rates."

Evidence for the role of obesity is conflicted and studies on prospectively collected data is sparse. We aimed to identify clinical and germline genetic risk factors associated with NEN in the UK Biobank. Methods Cases of NEN were identified in the UK Biobank's cancer registry data (N~500,000). Using a combination of ICD-O3 codes for cancer site and histology, NEN cases were stratified into neuroendocrine tumour (NET), neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and small / large cell lung cancer (SLCLC). A Cox-proportional hazards model was used to test for an association between clinical phenotypes and increased NEN risk, and a gene burden test in Regenie was used to test for causal variants in the exome sequencing data. Results We identified 704 NET, 340 NEC, and 550 SLCLC cases. Obesity (body mass index or waist-hip-ratio) and lower cholesterol (LDL, HDL or total) had a significantly significant association with NEN risk, however the effect size was marginal. Smoking and HbA1c associated only with SLCLC. Air pollution was not significantly associated when adjustment was made for socio-economic status. We replicated a known germline association between loss of function variants in MEN-1 and NEC, but did not detect any novel association in exome variants. Discussion This is the first large prospective population-based study to identify potential clinical and genetic risk factors for NEN and defined a novel phenotype in the UK Biobank. More research is needed to establish whether these relationships are causal. The exome study was underpowered, and future work in this area should focus on meta-analysing multiple large datasets."

Desquamative interstitial pneumonia, also related to smoking, is characterized by exertional dyspnea, dry cough, restrictive lung function, and ground-glass opacities on high-resolution CT. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia involves lymphocytic proliferation and is associated with autoimmune diseases or infections, treated with corticosteroids. Acute interstitial pneumonia resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome but occurs without a clear cause and is managed with supportive care.

It is a complex disease with chronic inflammatory airway changes caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, such as cigarette smoke. The disease involves persistent inflammation and oxidative stress, perpetuated by frequent exacerbations. The prevalence of COPD is on the rise, with the prediction that it will be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality over the next decade. Despite the global burden of COPD and its associated morbidity and mortality, treatment remains limited. Although the understanding of the pathogenesis of COPD has increased over the last two decades, molecular approaches to develop new therapies for the treatment of COPD have lagged. Here, we review the molecular approaches that have the potential for developing novel therapies for COPD."

Despite constant progress in diagnosis and therapy, survival rates of patients diagnosed with lung cancer remain unsatisfactory. Numerous epidemiological and experimental studies conducted as early as the 1970s confirm that the most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer is long-term smoking, which remains valid to this day. In the paper, the authors present the latest data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and molecular aspects of this cancer. In the last decade, many molecular alterations that are effective in the development of lung cancer have been discovered. In adenocarcinoma, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were developed for EGFR mutations and ALK and ROS1 translocations and were approved for use in the treatment of advanced stage adenocarcinomas. In the case of squamous cell carcinoma, the evaluation of these mutations is not yet being used in clinical practice. In addition, there are ongoing studies concerning many potential therapeutic molecular targets, such as ROS, MET, FGFR, DDR-2 and RET. Constant progress in diagnostic and therapeutic methods gives rise to hopes for an improved prognosis in patients with lung cancer."

Growing numbers of screening cases are also found to have CT-detectable emphysema or elevated levels of coronary calcium, indicating the presence of coronary artery disease. Early interventions based on these additional findings, especially with coronary calcium, are emerging and follow established protocols. Given the pace of diagnostic innovation and the potential public health impact, it is timely to review issues in developing useful chest CT screening infrastructure as chest CT screening will soon involve millions of participants worldwide. Lung cancer screening succeeds because it detects curable, early primary lung cancer by characterizing and measuring changes in non-calcified, lung nodules in the size-range from 3mm to 15 mm in diameter. Therefore, close attention to imaging methodology is essential to lung screening success and similar image quality issues are required for reliable quantitative characterization of early emphysema and coronary artery disease. Today's emergence of advanced image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting many aspects of medical imaging including chest CT screening. Given these emerging technological and volume trends, a major concern is how to balance the diverse needs of parties committed to building AI tools for precise, reproducible, and economical chest CT screening, while addressing the public health needs of screening participants receiving this service.

This study evaluates the protective effects of gallic acid (GA), a natural polyphenol with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, against ACR-induced lung injury. Fifty male rats were divided into five groups: Control, ACR, GA50 + ACR, GA100 + ACR, and GA100. Lung tissues were analyzed biochemically, histopathologically, immunohistochemically, and via immunofluorescence. GA exhibited dose-dependent protective effects by enhancing antioxidant defenses through Nrf-2 (43% increase) and HO-1 activation and reducing lipid peroxidation markers (MDA decreased by 38%). GA also suppressed pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α reduced by 35%) and restored anti-inflammatory levels by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, GA reduced apoptosis (Caspase-3 activity decreased by 30%) and preserved lung tissue integrity by mitigating oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG levels reduced by 29%) and pro-apoptotic signaling (Bax levels reduced by 34%). Computational analyses demonstrated GA's interaction with the KEAP1 protein, supporting its role in activating the KEAP1-Nrf2 pathway. These findings highlight GA's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, suggesting its therapeutic potential for protecting against ACR-induced lung injury and paving the way for future research in lung health and toxicology."

Children of smoking mothers are reported to have higher frequency and severity of respiratory diseases later in life; however, the mechanisms driving this increased vulnerability are not clearly understood. One potential cause of increased disease susceptibility is an altered immune system, originating in epigenetically maladaptive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that perinatal nicotine exposure (PNE) alters the establishment of HSCs and fetal-derived non-traditional tissue immune cells, with no alterations in circulating immune cell numbers. Suppression of HSCs and lung immune cells persisted for weeks after PNE had ceased. Strikingly, PNE led to increased disease susceptibility and severity upon challenge with influenza A virus in adulthood. This was associated with significant and highly selective alterations in lung immune cells, emphasizing the importance of cellular mechanisms in resilience to infections. Together, these experiments demonstrate that perinatal exposures that have deleterious consequences on hematopoietic establishment can impair immune function for life and identify the cellular mechanisms by which perinatal nicotine exposure predisposes the offspring to a weakened defense against respiratory pathogens."

This review explores non-pharmacologic strategies aimed at preventing AECOPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation consistently demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing exacerbations and mortality while improving exercise capacity and quality of life. Lung volume reduction, through both surgical and bronchoscopic methods, has shown promise in select patient groups, leading to improved lung function and reduced exacerbation risk. Smoking cessation remains a critical intervention, while the role of electronic cigarettes is still debated; some evidence suggests they may help patients unable to quit tobacco smoking. Vitamin D supplementation has shown potential in reducing exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe deficiency, though conflicting results warrant further research. Furthermore, shielding measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, have gained attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for their role in reducing exacerbation risk. Lastly, vaccination, diet and nutrition, and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may have important role in the prevention of AECOPD. These non-pharmacologic approaches should be integrated into comprehensive COPD management to improve outcomes and prevent AECOPD."

We extracted mortality data for all cancers combined and the most common sites from the WHO and population data since 1970 from the United Nations. Estimates for 2025 were computed applying a linear regression to the most recent segment identified through Poisson join-point regression. Avoided deaths number from 1991 to 2025 was estimated by applying the 1990 peak rate to population data. Mortality from all cancers is predicted to be favorable for both sexes in all countries. The lowest total cancer mortality rates are expected in Mexico (67.7/100 000 males; 61.4/100 000 females), while the highest ones in Cuba (136.6/100 000 males; 91.6/100 000 females). Prostate cancer mortality is declining in all countries, although rates remain high in Cuba (25.2/100 000 in 2025). Downward patterns are observed for all age groups in all countries, except the elderly in Cuba and Mexico. Declines in mortality are predicted for colorectal (except for males in Brazil and Cuba, and females in Chile), stomach (except Cuban males), pancreatic (except Argentinian and Cuban males), lung, bladder (except Argentinian females), breast, and ovarian (except Cuba) cancers. Uterine cancer mortality, particularly from cervical cancer, remains highin Argentina (10.2/100 000) and Cuba (10.4/100 000). Except for uterine, stomach, and prostate cancers, cancer mortality rates are still relatively low in Latin America, except Cuba.

        "abstract": "E-cigarettes (e-cigs) are a public health concern for young adults due to their popularity and evidence for increased oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Yet an extensive study defining the cell-specific immune changes upon exposure to flavored e-cigs remains elusive. To understand the immunological lung landscape upon acute nose-only exposure of C57BL/6J to flavored e-cig aerosols we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). scRNA profiles of 71,725 cells were generated from control and treatment groups (n=2/sex/group). A distinct phenotype of Ly6G-neutrophils was identified in lungs exposed to tobacco flavored e-cig aerosol which demonstrated dampened IL-1 mediated and pattern recognition signaling as compared to air controls. Differential gene expression analyses identified dysregulation of T-cell mediated pro-inflammation ("

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces the case of a 30-year-old female diagnosed with pulmonary spindle-cell carcinoma (PSCC), a rare non-small cell lung carcinoma, with no history of tobacco use or any other known risk factors. The patient, with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, showed symptoms of night fevers, thoracic pains, and massive pleural effusion, which led to a series of diagnostic studies, including imaging studies, biopsies, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The results from the pulmonary biopsy were used to make the definitive diagnosis of PSCC with negative results for the typical markers for this type of cancer. Following the diagnosis, the patient started a chemotherapy regimen consisting of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, with which she has survived for more than six months, despite the poor prognosis associated with PSCC. This case report highlights the rarity of this histological subtype, the difficulty in its diagnosis and management, the importance of completing a comprehensive diagnostic approach, and the need for further studies to improve the prognosis of these patients."

        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Smoking has been recognized as a risk factor of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and nicotine appears to be the responsible component of tobacco smoke that affects lung development. While nicotine-free electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are often promoted as a safer alternative to traditional smoking, recent evidence suggests that they might pose significant health risks. This study investigates the effects of nicotine-free e-cigarette vapor (ECV) on lung tissue and endothelial function. A mouse model of ECV-induced lung injury and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) were utilized to evaluate the impact of ECV exposure on mitochondrial function, endothelial cell viability, and glycocalyx shedding. ECV exposure significantly damages lung tissue, characterized by alveolar enlargement, inflammation, and vascular remodeling, indicative of emphysematous changes. In vitro, HPMVECs exposed to nicotine-free e-cigarette extract (ECE) demonstrated dose-dependent increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mPTP opening, and reduced ATP production, leading to enhanced endothelial permeability and glycocalyx degradation. The inhibition of mPTP opening with Cyclosporin A (CsA) was found to mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction and glycocalyx damage induced by ECE, indicating a protective role of mPTP inhibition in preserving endothelial integrity. The AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway was identified as a key regulator of these processes, with ECE exposure downregulating p-AKT and p-GSK3β, thereby promoting mPTP opening. Activation of AKT signaling partially reversed these effects, highlighting the potential of targeting the AKT/GSK3β-mPTP axis to mitigate the adverse effects of e-cigarette exposure on lung and endothelial function. These findings underscore the potential risks associated with nicotine-free e-cigarettes and suggest novel therapeutic targets for preventing lung injury progression."

        "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40023427/",
        "data": "2025",
        "abstract": "Components in tobacco smoke and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) aerosol form adducts with DNA, which can cause DNA mutations and affect repair of DNA damage. Numerous studies have shown a strong association between inhaled smoke and lung cancer. The presence of DNA adducts can indicate chemical components of smoke. Therefore, DNA adducts are significant biomarkers of tobacco exposure that might predict lung disease status and serve as precursors to lung cancer, since they trigger DNA mutations and impair biological processes such as DNA replication and transcription. To date, no systematic review has compared tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol in terms of the fate of DNA adducts. We reviewed recent studies comparing the formation of DNA adducts on exposure to components from conventional cigarette smoke versus e-cigarette aerosol. The aims of the review were threefold: (1) to summarize components of tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol in relation to mechanisms for the formation of DNA adducts; (2) to highlight the biological consequences of exposure to tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol; and (3) to summarize advances in understanding of the primary detection methods of DNA adducts in tobacco exposure studies. The findings of this review should benefit environmental toxicology studies of tobacco exposure."
