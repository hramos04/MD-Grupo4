In this context, it is easy to overlook or discount the health and social damage caused or contributed to by drinking. Alcohol consumption contributes to 2.6 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 4.7% of the global burden of disease.",

This phase of deep sleep is what helps you feel refreshed in the morning. It\u2019s also the phase in which your body repairs muscle and tissue, encourages growth and development, and improves immune function. About 90 minutes after falling asleep, your body enters REM sleep, which stands for Rapid Eye Movement sleep and is named so for the way your eyes quickly move back and forth behind your eyelids. REM sleep is thought to play a role in central nervous system development in infants, which might explain why infants need more REM sleep than adults.",

Physically, your body experiences faster and irregular breathing, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure; however, your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, stopping you from acting out your dreams. REM sleep increases with each new sleep cycle, starting at about ten minutes during the first cycle and lasting up to an hour in the final cycle. Stage 4 is the last stage before the cycle repeats.

Getting enough sleep from a regular sleep schedule can make it easier for you to cope with daily stress and less likely to be impacted by minor negative things that can come up. Other positive benefits of a regular sleep schedule include alertness, health and safety behaviors, and improved heart health. Sleep tends to be the first thing that gets sacrificed when life gets busy with work, school, or family commitments. When you value your sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can come more easily. The first step is to understand the benefits of getting enough quality sleep.",
