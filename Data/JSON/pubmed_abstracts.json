        "abstract": "Alcohol consumption has been shown to have complex, and sometimes paradoxical, associations with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Several hundred epidemiological studies on this topic have been published in recent decades. In this narrative review, the epidemiological evidence will be examined for the associations between alcohol consumption, including average alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and alcohol use disorders, and CVDs, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Methodological shortcomings, such as exposure classification and measurement, reference groups, and confounding variables (measured or unmeasured) are discussed. Based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the evidence seems to indicate non-linear relationships with many CVDs. Large-scale longitudinal epidemiological studies with multiple detailed exposure and outcome measurements, and the extensive assessment of genetic and confounding variables, are necessary to elucidate these associations further. Conflicting associations depending on the exposure measurement and CVD outcome are hard to reconcile, and make clinical and public health recommendations difficult. Furthermore, the impact of alcohol on other health outcomes needs to be taken into account. For people who drink alcohol, the less alcohol consumed the better."

        "abstract": "Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable neurodevelopmental period marked by high rates of engagement with risky alcohol use. This review summarizes the cognitive and neural consequences following alcohol use during adolescence from longitudinal design studies in humans and animals. Findings from human adolescent studies suggest that binge drinking and heavy alcohol use is associated with poorer cognitive functioning on a broad range of neuropsychological assessments, including learning, memory, visuospatial functioning, psychomotor speed, attention, executive functioning, and impulsivity. Alcohol use during adolescence is associated with accelerated decreases in gray matter and attenuated increases in white matter volume, and aberrant neural activity during executive functioning, attentional control, and reward sensitivity tasks, when compared to non-drinking adolescents. Animal studies in rodents and non-human primates have replicated human findings, and suggest cognitive and neural consequences of adolescent alcohol use may persist into adulthood. Novel rodent studies demonstrate that adolescent alcohol use may increase reward responsiveness of the dopamine system to alcohol later in life, as well as disrupt adolescent neurogenesis, potentially through neuroinflammation, with long-lasting neural and behavioral effects into adulthood. Larger longitudinal human cognitive and neuroimaging studies with more diverse samples are currently underway which will improve understanding of the impact of polysubstance use, as well as the interactive effects of substance use, physical and mental health, and demographic factors on cognition and neurodevelopment."

Global trends of increasing alcohol use among women of childbearing age due to economic development, changing gender roles, increased availability of alcohol, peer pressure and social acceptability of women's alcohol use may put an increasing number of pregnancies at risk for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). This risk has been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in some countries. This literature review presents an overview on the epidemiology of alcohol use among childbearing age and pregnant women and FASD by World Health Organization regions; impact of PAE on fetal health, including FASD; associated comorbidities; and social outcomes. The impact of alcohol on fetal health and social outcomes later in life is enormous, placing a huge economic burden on countries.

Alcohol intake causes a large variety of tissue damages severely impacting the nervous system, digestive and cardiovascular systems and causing oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, esophageal, colon-rectal, laryngeal, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, and breast cancers. Alcohol can also play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy and hemorrhagic strokes. When drunk during pregnancy it is proved to be responsible for serious damage to fetuses causing a wide range of pathological conditions from miscarriage to Fetal Alcoholic Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Acute ethanol intoxication happens when the amount of alcohol consumed is greater than the disposal capacity of the liver, causing an accumulation of its metabolites displayed by initial dysphoria and disinhibition. Nausea, vomiting, memory loss could happen. Although, it can lead to more serious conditions like impaired speaking, impaired coordination, unstable gait, nystagmus, stupor, or coma. Respiratory depression and death could also happen in such cases. Unfortunately, diagnosis of acute alcohol intoxication is difficult because most of the drinkers deny or minimize their assumption. It is dramatically important to assess when the last intake happened to avoid withdrawal syndrome. Alcohol acute intoxication can be considered a serious harm to health and a relevant issue for healthcare provid-ers working in emergency rooms. Differential diagnosis is crucial to avoid serious outcomes. There is no consensus about therapies for acute intoxication, but supportive and symptomatic treatments were proved effective. The repercussions of alcohol misuse over drinkers' social, familiar, economical and working life enhance the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in such cases."

        "abstract": "Alcohol abuse disorder is a serious condition, implicating more than 15 million people aged 12 years and older in 2019 in the United States. Ethanol (or ethyl alcohol) is mainly oxidized in the liver, resulting in the synthesis of acetaldehyde and acetate, which are toxic and carcinogenic metabolites, as well as in the generation of a reductive cellular environment. Moreover, ethanol can interact with lipids, generating fatty acid ethyl esters and phosphatidylethanol, which interfere with physiological cellular pathways. This narrative review summarizes the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on male fertility by describing its metabolism and how ethanol consumption may induce cellular damage. Furthermore, the impact of alcohol consumption on hormonal regulation, semen quality, and genetic and epigenetic regulations is discussed based on evidence from animal and human studies, focusing on the consequences on the offspring. Finally, the limitations of the current evidence are discussed. Our review highlights the association between chronic alcohol consumption and poor semen quality, mainly due to the development of oxidative stress, as well as its genotoxic impact on hormonal regulation and DNA integrity, affecting the offspring's health. New landscapes of investigation are proposed for the identification of molecular markers for alcohol-associated infertility, with a focus on advanced OMICS-based approaches applied to the analysis of semen samples."

This is in part due to the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the absorption of vital nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, lipids, water, vitamins, and minerals within the small intestine. Recent advances in research, along with new cutting-edge technologies, have advanced our understanding of the mechanism of ethanol's effect on intestinal nutrient absorption at the brush border membrane (BBM) of the small intestine. However, further studies are needed to delineate how ethanol consumption could have an impact on altered nutrient absorption under various disease conditions. Current research has elucidated the relationship of alcohol consumption on glucose, glutamine, vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B9 (folate), C (ascorbic acid), selenium, iron, and zinc absorption within the small intestine. We conducted systematic computerized searches in PubMed using the following keywords: (1) \"Alcohol effects on nutrient transport\"; (2) \"Alcohol mediated malabsorption of nutrients\"; (3) \"Alcohol effects on small intestinal nutrient transport\"; and (4) \"Alcohol mediated malabsorption of nutrients in small intestine\". We included the relevant studies in this review. The main objective of this review is to marshal and analyze previously published research articles and discuss, in-depth, the understanding of ethanol's effect in modulating absorption of vital macro and micronutrients in health and disease conditions. This could ultimately provide great insights in the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat malnutrition associated with alcohol consumption."

Several intracellular signaling pathways control this balance, including mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (C1). Activation of this pathway in skeletal muscle is controlled, in part, by nutrition (e.g., amino acids and alcohol) and exercise (e.g., resistance exercise (RE)). Acute and chronic alcohol use can result in myopathy, and evidence points to altered mTORC1 signaling as a contributing factor. Moreover, individuals who regularly perform RE or vigorous aerobic exercise are more likely to use alcohol frequently and in larger quantities. Therefore, alcohol may antagonize beneficial exercise-induced increases in mTORC1 pathway signaling. The purpose of this review is to synthesize up-to-date evidence regarding mTORC1 pathway signaling and the independent and combined effects of acute alcohol and RE on activation of the mTORC1 pathway. Overall, acute alcohol impairs and RE activates mTORC1 pathway signaling; however, effects vary by model, sex, feeding, training status, quantity, etc., such that anabolic stimuli may partially rescue the alcohol-mediated pathway inhibition. Likewise, the impact of alcohol on RE-induced mTORC1 pathway signaling appears dependent on several factors including nutrition and sex, although many questions remain unanswered. Accordingly, we identify gaps in the literature that remain to be elucidated to fully understand the independent and combined impacts of alcohol and RE on mTORC1 pathway signaling."

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020, moderate red wine consumption-defined as up to two units of alcohol per day for men and up to one unit of alcohol per day for women-significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease which represents the major causes of mortality, and disability, in developed countries. We reviewed the available literature concerning the potential relationship between moderate red wine consumption and cardiovascular health. We searched Medline, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) for randomized controlled studies and case-control studies published from 2002 to 2022. A total of 27 articles were selected for the review. According to epidemiological evidence, drinking red wine in moderation lowers the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Red wine contains both alcoholic and non-alcoholic ingredients; however, it is yet unclear which is to blame for these effects. Combining wine with the diet of healthy individuals may add additional benefits. New studies should focus more on the characterization of the individual components of wine, to allow the analysis and study of the impact of each of them on the prevention and treatment of certain diseases."

Here, we investigate the role of the intestinal clock in controlling liver rhythmicity and metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis, metabolomics, metabolic assays, histology, quantitative (q)PCR, and immunoblotting were performed with Bmal1-intestine-specific knockout (iKO), Rev-erba-iKO, and control mice. Bmal1 iKO caused large-scale reprogramming of the rhythmic transcriptome of mouse liver with a limited effect on its clock. In the absence of intestinal Bmal1, the liver clock was resistant to entrainment by inverted feeding and a high-fat diet. Importantly, Bmal1 iKO remodelled diurnal hepatic metabolism by shifting to gluconeogenesis from lipogenesis during the dark phase, leading to elevated glucose production (hyperglycaemia) and insulin insensitivity. Conversely, Rev-erba iKO caused a diversion to lipogenesis from gluconeogenesis during the light phase, resulting in enhanced lipogenesis and an increased susceptibility to alcohol-related liver injury. These temporal diversions were attributed to disruption of hepatic SREBP-1c rhythmicity, which was maintained via gut-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids produced by intestinal FADS1/2 under the control of a local clock. Our findings establish a pivotal role for the intestinal clock in dictating liver rhythmicity and diurnal metabolism, and suggest targeting intestinal rhythms as a new avenue for improving metabolic health. Our findings establish the centrality of the intestinal clock among peripheral tissue clocks, and associate liver-related pathologies with its malfunction. Clock modifiers in the intestine are shown to modulate liver metabolism with improved metabolic parameters. Such knowledge will help clinicians improve the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseases by incorporating intestinal circadian factors."

Lab-based studies have investigated the alcohol priming effect; however, heterogeneity in designs has resulted in some inconsistent findings. The aims of this meta-analysis were to (i) determine the pooled effect size for motivation to drink following priming, measured by alcohol consumption and craving, and (ii) examine whether design characteristics influenced any priming effect. Literature searches of PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus in October 2020 (updated October 2021) identified lab-based alcohol priming studies that assessed effect of priming on motivation to drink. A tailored risk-of-bias tool assessed quality of lab-based studies. Random effects meta-analyses were computed on outcome data from 38 studies comparing the effect of a priming dose of alcohol against control on subsequent alcohol consumption/self-reported craving. Study characteristics that might have affected outcomes were design type (within/between-participant), dose of prime, time of motivation assessment, type of control drink (placebo alcohol/soft drink). Relative to control, alcohol had a small-to-moderate priming effect on subsequent alcohol consumption (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.336 [95% CI, 0.171, 0.500]) and craving (SMD = 0.431 [95% CI, 0.306, 0.555]). Aspects of study design differentially affected consumption and craving. The size of the priming dose had no effect on consumption, but larger doses were sometimes associated with greater craving (with craving generally following the blood alcohol curve). Alcohol priming effects for consumption, but not craving, were smaller when compared with placebo, relative to soft drink, control. Lab-based alcohol priming studies are a valid paradigm from which to investigate the impact of acute intoxication on alcohol motivation. Designs are needed that assess the impact of acute consumption on motivation to drink in more varied and realistic ways."

Unrecorded alcohol includes homemade, illicit, or surrogate alcohols. The aim of this review is to update the evidence on unrecorded alcohol and its impact on health. A narrative review and qualitative synthesis of scientific literature (English and Russian) for the period 2016-2020 was conducted. A total of 100 articles were included in the synthesis. The most harm because of unrecorded alcohol seems to be caused by ethanol, although single and mass methanol poisonings constitute exceptions. Nevertheless, unrecorded consumption is associated with disproportionate harm that goes beyond toxicity, which is linked to hazardous drinking patterns of unrecorded alcohol, and its association with alcohol use disorders and social marginalization. The online sale of unrecorded alcohol, which circumvents alcohol availability regulations, is an emerging and not yet well-explored issue. Policy options include restricting access to methanol, increasing taxation, denaturing ethanol-containing liquids that could be used as surrogates, introducing more effective and less toxic denaturizing additives, and improving monitoring systems for fraud, tax evasion, and local sales restrictions, including raising the minimum legal drinking age. These measures should be implemented within a holistic policy framework to avoid unintended effects, such as an increase in total alcohol consumption, shifts from certain types of unrecorded products to potentially toxic alternatives, or limiting economic activity and jeopardizing the livelihoods of vulnerable populations (e.g., women comprise the majority of those making homebrew in some countries)."

This manuscript presents selected key variables that represent the Alcohol Exposome. The primary variables that make up the Alcohol Exposome can include comorbidities such as cigarettes, poor diet, occupational hazards, environmental hazards, infectious agents, and aging. In addition to representing multiple factors, the Alcohol Exposome examines the various types of intercellular communications that are carried from one organ system to another and may greatly impact the types of injuries and metabolites caused by alcohol exposure. The intent of defining the Alcohol Exposome is to bring the newly expanded definition of Exposomics, meaning the study of the exposome, to the field of alcohol research and to emphasize the need for examining research results in a non-isolated environment representing a more relevant manner in which all human physiology exists."

        "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests that parental exposure to drugs of abuse can affect offspring phenotypes. The impacts of drug abuse on germ cell quality may mediate multigenerational and transgenerational inheritance, although biological pathways underlying this mode of inheritance are not yet characterized. Germline epigenetic marks are modified by drug exposure and have emerged as promising mechanistic candidates in recent work. Drug exposure also impacts overall germline integrity and reproductive functioning, although the role of these consequences in multi/transgenerational inheritance is unclear. This review synthesizes literature on effects of exposure to alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine on the germline with a focus on epigenetic modifications following drug exposure and broader impacts on germline integrity and reproductive functioning. We discuss potential interactions between reproductive functioning, germline integrity, and germline epigenome/transcriptome in pathways underlying multi/transgenerational inheritance. We find that existing data may support independent or interactive contributions of these germline impacts on offspring phenotypes in a manner that may mediate multi/transgenerational inheritance."

However, patients admitted with concurrent substance use have increased risk of complications and poor outcomes. The impact of alcohol and methamphetamine use on acute burn resuscitation has been described in single-center studies; however, has not been studied since implementation of computerized decision support for resuscitation. Patients were evaluated based presence of alcohol, with a minimum blood alcohol level of 0.10, or positive methamphetamines on urine drug screen. Fluid volumes and urine output were examined over 48 hours. A total of 296 patients were analyzed. 37 (12.5%) were positive for methamphetamine use, 50 (16.9%) were positive for alcohol use, and 209 (70.1%) with negative for both. Patients positive for methamphetamine received a mean of 5.30 ± 2.63 cc/kg/TBSA, patients positive for alcohol received a mean of 5.41 ± 2.49 cc/kg/TBSA, and patients with neither received a mean of 4.33 ± 1.79 cc/kg/TBSA. Patients with methamphetamine or alcohol use had significantly higher fluid requirements. In the first 6 hours patients with alcohol use had significantly higher urinary output (UO) in comparison to patients with methamphetamine use which had similar output to patients negative for both substances. This study demonstrated that patients with alcohol and methamphetamine use had statistically significantly greater fluid resuscitation requirements compared to patients without. The effects of alcohol as a diuretic align with previous literature. However, patients with methamphetamine lack the increased UO as a cause for their increased fluid requirements."

PAE immediately impacts fetal growth, but its effects carry forward post-parturition, into adolescence and adulthood, and can result in a cluster of disabilities, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Emerging preclinical and clinical research investigating neurological and behavioral outcomes in exposed offspring point to genetic sex as an important modifier of the effects of PAE. In this review, we discuss the literature on sex differences following PAE, with studies spanning the fetal period through adulthood, and highlight gaps in research where sex differences are likely, but currently under-investigated. Understanding how sex and PAE interact to affect offspring health outcomes across the lifespan is critical for identifying the full complement of PAE-associated secondary conditions, and for refining targeted interventions to improve the quality of life for individuals with PAE."

        "abstract": "The diverse forms of unrecorded alcohol, defined as beverage alcohol not registered in official statistics in the country where it is consumed, comprise about one fourth of all alcohol consumed worldwide. Since unrecorded alcohol is usually cheaper than registered commercial alcohol, a standard argument against raising alcohol excise taxes has been that doing so could potentially result in an increase in unrecorded consumption. This contribution examines whether increases in taxation have in fact led to increases in consumption of unrecorded alcohol, and whether these increases in unrecorded alcohol should be considered to be a barrier to raising taxes. A second aim is to outline mitigation strategies to reduce unrecorded alcohol use. Narrative review of primary and secondary research, namely case studies and narrative and systematic reviews on unrecorded alcohol use worldwide. Unrecorded alcohol consumption did not automatically increase with increases in taxation and subsequent price increases of registered commercial alcohol. Instead, the level of unrecorded consumption depended on: a) the availability and type of unrecorded alcohol; b) whether such consumption was non-stigmatized; c) the primary population groups which consumed unrecorded alcohol before the policy change; and d) the policy measures taken. Mitigation strategies are outlined. Potential increases in the level of unrecorded alcohol consumption should be considered in the planning and implementation of substantial increases in alcohol taxation. However, unrecorded consumption should not be considered to be a principal barrier to implementing tax interventions, as evidence does not indicate an increase in consumption if mitigation measures are put in place by governments."

Chronic ethanol administration in mice causes migration of Candida albicans (C. albicans)-reactive Th17 cells from the intestine to the liver. The antifungal agent nystatin decreased C. albicans-specific Th17 cells in the liver and reduced ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Transgenic mice expressing T cell receptors (TCRs) reactive to Candida antigens developed more severe ethanol-induced liver disease than transgene-negative littermates. Adoptively transferring Candida-specific TCR transgenic T cells or polyclonal C. albicans-primed T cells exacerbated ethanol-induced liver disease in wild-type mice. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) receptor A signaling in Kupffer cells was required for the effects of polyclonal C. albicans-primed T cells.

A narrative review study was done on manuscript published documents about the stability of the virus, different types of disinfectants and the effects of disinfectants on SARS-CoV2 and environment from 2005 to 2022 based on Searched databases included Google Scholar, Springer, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct (Scopus). All relevant studies published 2005 until 2022 gathered. According to the databases, 670 articles were retrieved. Thirty studies were screened after review and 30 full-text articles entered into the analysis process. Finally, 14 articles were selected in this study. New coronavirus could survive until 9 days in room temperature; the surviving time decreases if temperature increases. The virus can survive in various plastic, glass, and metal surfaces for hours to days. Disinfectants, such as alcohol, isopropanol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and ethanol, can kill 70-90% viruses in up to 30 s but should be noted that these disinfectants are recognized by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a potential carcinogen. According to the different reports, increased duration and level of disinfectant exposure can have negative impacts on human and animal health including upper and lower respiratory tract irritation, inflammation, edema, ulceration, and allergic reactions."

In European countries in which red wide intake is not negligible (such as France), the association between cholesterol and cardiovascular (CV) risk was less evident, suggesting the action of some protective molecules in red wine or other foods and drinks. This narrative review is based on the material searched for and obtained via PubMed up to May 2016. The search terms we used were: \"red wine, cardiovascular, alcohol\" in combination with \"polyphenols, heart failure, infarction\". Epidemiological and mechanistic evidence of a J-shaped relationship between red wine intake and CV risk further supported the \"French paradox\". Specific components of red wine both in vitro and in animal models were discovered. Polyphenols and especially resveratrol largely contribute to CV prevention mainly through antioxidant properties. They exert beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic diseases, thus reducing the risk of adverse CV events such as myocardial infarction ischemic stroke and heart failure. Of interest, recent studies pointed out the role of ethanol itself as a potential cardioprotective agent, but a clear epidemiological evidence is still missing. The aim of this narrative review is to update current knowledge on the intracellular mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effects of polyphenols and ethanol. Furthermore, we summarized the results of epidemiological studies, emphasizing their methodological criticisms and the need for randomized clinical trials able to clarify the potential role of red wine consumption in reducing CV risk. Caution in avowing underestimation of the global burden of alcohol-related diseases was particularly used."

The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess risk of bias, and the Bradford Hill Criteria were used to infer causality for outcome measures. MUP sets a legally required floor price per unit of alcohol and is estimated to reduce alcohol-attributable healthcare burden. All studies meeting inclusion criteria from any country INTERVENTION: Minimum pricing policy of alcohol PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: RESULTS: 22 studies met inclusion criteria; 6 natural experiments and 16 modelling studies. Countries included Australia, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. Modelling studies estimated that MUP could reduce alcohol-related admissions by 3%-10% annually and the majority of real-world studies demonstrated that acute alcohol-related admissions responded immediately and reduced by 2%-9%, and chronic alcohol-related admissions lagged by 2-3 years and reduced by 4%-9% annually. Minimum pricing could target the heaviest consumers from the most deprived groups who tend to be at greatest risk of alcohol harms, and in so doing has the potential to reduce health inequalities. Using the Bradford Hill Criteria, we inferred a 'moderate-to-strong' causal link that MUP could reduce alcohol-related hospitalisation. Natural studies were consistent with minimum pricing modelling studies and showed that this policy could reduce alcohol-related hospitalisation and health inequalities. CRD42021274023."

        "abstract": "Connections between substance use, impairment, and road safety have been frequently researched. Yet, little is known about how simultaneous use of opioids and alcohol affects road safety outcomes, which is an increasingly critical link within the current landscape of the substance use environment and public health. Lack of this understanding is partly due to testing complications and data limitations. We define polysubstance use here as alcohol and opioids consumed together or within a small-time window such that both are present in the system. This polysubstance use is on the rise and produces greater health risks than when the substances are consumed separately. Given the increasing rate of opioid use, high prevalence of alcohol use, and dangers of polysubstance use, we aim to synthesize literature on the prevalence and impact of this polysubstance on road safety-related outcomes. We performed a systematic review of studies published between 1974 and 2020 that examined opioid and alcohol use exposures and road safety-related outcomes. Out of 644 initial findings, 20 studies were included in this review. Outcomes included motor vehicle crash injuries, deaths, or driver culpability; suspected driving under the influence; and simulated driving performance. Evidence from multiple sources showed a significant rise, approximately 1% to 7%, in the prevalence of opioids among fatally injured drivers in the U.S. from 1995 to 2016. Information published on the simultaneous presence of opioids and alcohol in people involved in crashes was scarce. The limited available findings point toward an overlap where up to 30% of opioid-positive people involved in a crash were also positive for alcohol. Studies also suggest a possibly elevated risk presented by this polysubstance use relative to the substances used alone, though the majority of identified studies did not estimate this association. The synthesized research indicates that alcohol and opioid use is not uncommon and may be increasing among people involved in adverse driving events. More research and better data are needed to improve estimates of association with road traffic-related outcomes, potentially improving substance testing in current surveillance systems or using linked data sets and other novel data sources to improve estimates."

The gut microbiome plays an important role in the body and contributes to digestive health, the immune system, and brain function. The gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system through the vagal pathways as well as the endocrine or immune pathways. Changes in the proportion or diversity of the microbiota can have an impact on normal physiology and has been implicated in inflammation, depression, obesity, and addiction. Several animal studies suggest the involvement of gut microbiome in the regulation of pain, emotion, and cognition. Alcoholism has been linked with gut microbiome dysbiosis and thus can have deleterious effects on the gut-brain axis balance. Gut microbiome produces important metabolites such as gastrointestinal hormones, short chain fatty acids, precursors to the neuroactive compounds and neurotransmitters that impact the physiology and normal functioning of the body. The microbiome imbalance has been correlated with behavioral changes and alcohol dependence in the host.

The TLR4/NF-kB pathway, crucial for inflammatory and immune responses, triggers the production of pro-inflammatory agents and type-1 interferon, disrupting the balance between inflammatory and antioxidant responses when tissues are chronically exposed to alcohol. Alcohol-induced dysbiosis in gut microbes heightens gut wall permeability to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to liver cell infection and subsequent inflammation. Concurrently, CYP2E1-mediated alcohol metabolism generates ROS, causing oxidative stress and damaging cells, lipids, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). To counteract this inflammatory imbalance, Nrf2 regulates gene expression, inhibiting inflammatory progression and promoting antioxidant responses. Excessive alcohol intake results in elevated liver enzymes (ADH, CYP2E1, and catalase), ROS, NADH, acetaldehyde, and acetate, leading to damage in vital organs such as the heart, brain, and lungs. Moreover, alcohol negatively affects reproductive health by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing infertility in both men and women. These findings underscore the profound health concerns associated with alcohol-induced damage, emphasizing the need for public awareness regarding the intricate interplay between immune responses and the multi-organ impacts of alcohol consumption."

Improving alcohol health literacy presents an integrated approach to alcohol prevention and an important complement to alcohol policy. Our aim was to identify and prioritize measures to enhance alcohol health literacy and hence to reduce alcohol consumption, using Germany as an example. A series of recommendations for improving alcohol health literacy were derived from a review of the literature and subsequently rated by five experts. Recommendations were rated according to their likely impact on enhancing (a) alcohol health literacy and (b) reducing alcohol consumption. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a two-way intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Eleven recommendations were established for three areas of action: (1) education and information, (2) health care system, and (3) alcohol control policy. Education and information measures were rated high to increase alcohol health literacy but low to their impact on alcohol consumption, while this pattern was reversed for alcohol control policies. The ratings showed good agreement (ICC: 0.85-0.88). Improving alcohol health literacy and reducing alcohol consumption should be considered complementary and become part of a comprehensive alcohol strategy to curb the health, social, and economic burden of alcohol."

        "abstract": "Interoception refers to the perception of the internal state of the body and is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in mental health disorders. Drugs of abuse produce powerful interoceptive states that are upstream of behaviors that drive and influence drug intake, and addiction pathology is impacted by interoceptive processes. The goal of the present review is to discuss interoceptive processes related to alcohol. We will cover physiological responses to alcohol, how interoceptive states can impact drinking, and the recruitment of brain networks as informed by clinical research. We also review the molecular and brain circuitry mechanisms of alcohol interoceptive effects as informed by preclinical studies. Finally, we will discuss emerging treatments with consideration of interoception processes. As our understanding of the role of interoception in drug and alcohol use grows, we suggest that the convergence of information provided by clinical and preclinical studies will be increasingly important. Given the complexity of interoceptive processing and the multitude of brain regions involved, an overarching network-based framework can provide context for how focused manipulations modulate interoceptive processing as a whole. In turn, preclinical studies can systematically determine the roles of individual nodes and their molecular underpinnings in a given network, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets and directions. As interoceptive processing drives and influences motivation, emotion, and subsequent behavior, consideration of interoception is important for our understanding of processes that drive ongoing drinking and relapse."

Three divided-attention tasks were performed following administration of placebo, cannabis, and/or alcohol. Healthy adult cannabis users participated in 6 sessions, receiving combinations of cannabis (placebo/low-THC/high-THC) and alcohol (placebo/active) in randomized order, separated by washout periods of ≥1 week. At 0.5 hours post-dosing, participants performed simulator drives in the University of Iowa National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS-1), a full vehicle cab simulator with a 360° horizontal field of view and motion base that provides realistic feedback. Drives contained repeated instances of three tasks: a side-mirror task (reaction to a triangle appearing in the side-mirrors), an artist-search task (select a specified artist from a navigable menu on the vehicle's console), and a message-reading task (read aloud a message displayed on the console). Blood THC and breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) were interpolated using individual power curves from samples collected approximately 0.17, 0.42, 1.4, and 2.3 hours post-dose. Driving measures during tasks were compared to equal-duration control periods occurring just prior to the task. Performance shifts, task completion, and lane departures were modeled relative to blood THC and BrAC using mixed-effects regression models. Each 1 µg/L increase in blood THC concentration predicted increased odds of failing to complete the artist-search task (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11, p = 0.046), increased odds of selecting at least one incorrect response (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09, p = 0.041), declines in speed during the side-mirror task (0.005 m/s, 95% CI: 0.001-0.009, p = 0.023), and longer lane departure durations during the artist-search task (0.74% of task-period, 95% CI: 0.12-1.36 p = 0.020). BrAC (approximately 0.05%) was not associated with task performance, though each 0.01 g/210 L increase predicted longer departure durations during the side-mirror task (1.41% of task-period, 95% CI: 0.08-2.76, p = 0.040) and increased standard deviation of lane position in the message-reading task (0.61 cm, 95% CI: 0.14-1.08, p = 0.011). With increasing medical and legal cannabis use, understanding the impact of acute cannabis use on driving performance, including divided-attention, is essential. These data indicate that impaired divided-attention performance is a safety concern."

The purpose of this study was to better understand how adolescents perceive alcohol-related content in both entertainment and social media, with a focus on the valence of portrayals (i.e., positive, negative) and impacts on cognitions and behaviors. Participants were 40 high school students (60% female). Nine focus groups were conducted via videoconferencing, stratified by grade (9th/10th, 11th/12th) and gender. Transcripts were analyzed via template-style thematic analyses to identify themes. Six themes were developed, including (a) some portrayals of alcohol may increase likelihood of using alcohol, (b) some portrayals of alcohol in the media can discourage drinking, (c) sometimes truly negative consequences of alcohol are portrayed positively or downplayed, (d) media portrayals of alcohol are perceived to be based in reality but are at times exaggerated, (e) adolescent and adult alcohol use is portrayed differently in entertainment media, and (f) the extent to which adolescents are influenced by the media may depend on their preexisting attitudes, beliefs, and education. Adolescents have awareness of media portrayals of alcohol, both positive and negative, and their associated impacts. Findings highlight the need for much more work to understand the conditions under which, and for whom, exposure to different types of positive portrayals of alcohol in the media translate into positive expectancies about alcohol or drinking motives. Such work may ultimately inform intervention targets to reduce early initiation and/or risky drinking among adolescents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."

Reaction severity is unpredictable, and patients will often experience reactions of variable severity, even to an identical exposure (both dose and allergen). A common explanation for this phenomenon has been the impact of \"cofactors\"-factors that might contribute to reaction severity independent of the allergen exposure. Cofactors can influence reaction severity in 2 ways: either by reducing the reaction threshold (ie, the dose needed to trigger any symptoms) so that patients have no symptoms in the absence of the cofactor and only react with the cofactor present, or by increasing reaction severity such that individuals have only mild symptoms in the absence of the cofactor, but a more severe reaction when the cofactor is present. Indeed, the same patient may have reactions with different cofactors or even need more than one cofactor to develop a severe reaction. Cofactors reportedly play a role in approximately 30% of anaphylaxis reactions in adults. Exercise, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol, and sleep deprivation are the most frequent cofactors reported. Routine evaluation of the possible involvement of cofactors is essential in managing patients with food anaphylaxis: in patients with a suggestive history but a negative oral food challenge, cofactors should be taken into account to provide appropriate advice to reduce the risk of future anaphylaxis."

The current review examines the animal literature for impacts of comorbid alcohol and methamphetamine exposure. We found evidence for additive or synergistic effects of combined or sequential exposure on behavior and physiology. Dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems are all impacted by combined exposure to alcohol and methamphetamine and cyclooxygenase-2 activity plays an important role in their combined neurotoxic effects. Adverse consequences of comorbid exposure include altered brain development with prenatal exposure, impaired learning and memory, motor deficits, gastrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and augmented intake under some conditions. Given high susceptibility to drug experimentation in adolescence, studies of co-exposure during the adolescent period and of how adolescent exposure to one drug impacts later use or sensitivity to the other drug should be a priority. Further, to gain traction on prevention and treatment, additional research to identify motivational and neurobiological drivers and consequences of comorbid use is needed."

Animal model investigations, encompassing first and second trimester-equivalent exposures and the critical third trimester, where the brain growth spurt starts, reveal specific alterations in thalamic structures and circuits, emphasizing the specificity of damage to corticothalamic loops. The ventrobasal thalamic nucleus exhibits a unique response to PAE, involving intricate interactions with postnatal neurogenesis and neurotrophin responsiveness. Third trimester-equivalent exposure consistently induces apoptotic neurodegeneration in various thalamic nuclei, highlighting the heightened susceptibility of the visual thalamus, particularly the lateral geniculate nucleus, during critical developmental periods. The nucleus reuniens, vital for cognitive processes, was shown to be significantly affected by alcohol exposure during this period. Investigations into the trigeminal/somatosensory system activity revealed disruptions in glucose utilization and increased neuronal activity in the thalamus. Research on binge-like alcohol exposure during the brain growth spurt demonstrates lasting modifications in action-potential properties and synaptic currents in thalamic neurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex. Human studies, employing advanced techniques like super-resolution fetal MRI and functional MRI, underscore the PAE-induced structural and functional consequences in the thalamus and its connections, spanning from fetal development to adulthood. The complex effects of PAE on thalamic structure and function vary across developmental stages, emphasizing the importance of considering factors such as age and concurrent exposures. The development of higher-resolution imaging tools is essential for assessing the impact of PAE on the structure and function of individual thalamic nuclei in humans."

The relationship between alcohol use and cardiovascular risk is complex. While it is well established that heavy alcohol use and binge drinking harm cardiovascular health, the effect of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption remains controversial. Observational studies have repeatedly confirmed the U- or J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease risk, with the lowest risk observed in the light-to-moderate drinking group. However, the protective effect of low-level alcohol has been challenged by recent genetic epidemiological studies with Mendelian randomization. Such studies have their own limitations, and the application of this methodology in studying alcohol has been questioned. Results from the latest Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study suggest that the impact of alcohol consumption on health depends on the age structure and the distribution of disease burden and underlying causes in a given population. For young adults, even small amounts of alcohol cause heath loss. For older adults facing a high burden of cardiovascular diseases, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption may improve cardiovascular health outcomes. Mechanistically, all types of alcoholic beverages, including wine, spirits, and beer, have been shown to increase the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin, and reduce the level of fibrinogen. Nonalcoholic components of wine, especially polyphenolic compounds like resveratrol, may additionally enhance endothelial nitric oxide production, and provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects."

Although mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the earliest manifestations of alcohol-induced injury, restoring mitochondrial activity remains a problematic strategy due to oxidative stress. Here, we identify methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ) as a mediator for ALD progression and hypothesize that targeting MCJ may help in recovering mitochondrial fitness without collateral oxidative damage. C57BL/6 mice [wild-type (Wt)] Mcj knockout and Mcj liver-specific silencing (MCJ-LSS) underwent the NIAAA dietary protocol (Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (vol/vol) ethanol for 10 days, plus a single binge ethanol feeding at day 11). To evaluate the impact of a restored mitochondrial activity in ALD, the liver, gut, and pancreas were characterized, focusing on lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, intestinal permeability, and microbiota composition. MCJ, a protein acting as an endogenous negative regulator of mitochondrial respiration, is downregulated in the early stages of ALD and increases with the severity of the disease. Whole-body deficiency of MCJ is detrimental during ALD because it exacerbates the systemic effects of alcohol abuse through altered intestinal permeability, increased endotoxemia, and dysregulation of pancreatic function, which overall worsens liver injury. On the other hand, liver-specific Mcj silencing prevents main ALD hallmarks, that is, mitochondrial dysfunction, steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as it restores the NAD + /NADH ratio and SIRT1 function, hence preventing de novo lipogenesis and improving lipid oxidation. Improving mitochondrial respiration by liver-specific Mcj silencing might become a novel therapeutic approach for treating ALD."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature regarding the concurrent use (co-use) of alcohol and cannabis and competing hypotheses as to whether cannabis acts as a substitute for (i.e., replacing the effects of alcohol, resulting in decreased use) or a complement to (i.e., used to enhance the effects of alcohol, resulting in increased use) alcohol. The impact of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes has received increased attention in the wake of ongoing legalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes. Evidence for both hypotheses exists in the literature across a broad range of data collection methods and samples and is carefully reviewed here. In addition, various mechanisms by which cannabis may act as an alcohol substitute or complement are explored in depth with the goal of better understanding equivocal findings. This review includes articles that were identified from a search for studies on alcohol and cannabis co-use, with a specific focus on studies exploring complementary versus substitution aspects of co-use. Search terms were included in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were those that measured alcohol and cannabis co-use in human samples in laboratory, survey, or ecological momentary assessment studies, or that directly referenced substitution or complementary patterns of use. Search results returned 650 articles, with 95 meeting inclusion criteria. Results of this review reveal compelling evidence for both substitution and complementary effects, suggesting nuanced yet significant distinctions across different populations examined in these studies. Several mechanisms for the impact of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes are identified, including patterns and context of co-use, timing and order of use, cannabinoid formulation, pharmacokinetic interactions, and user characteristics (including diagnostic status), all of which may influence substitution versus complementary effects. This review will inform future research studies examining this topic in both clinical and community samples and aid in the development of treatment and prevention efforts targeting those populations most vulnerable to negative consequences of co-use. Finally, this review highlights the need for additional research in more diverse samples and the use of mixed-methods designs to examine both pharmacological and contextual influences on co-use."

        "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are an important preventable global health concern. FASD is an umbrella term describing a range of mild to severe cognitive and behavioral problems among individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. Alcohol causes FASD by interfering with molecular pathways during fetal development involving increased oxidative stress, disturbed organ development, and change of epigenetic gene expression control. Neuroimaging studies into FASD show several neuropathological abnormalities including abnormal brain structure, cortical development, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. Individuals with FASD experience a wide range of cognitive and behavioral challenges. Risks of violent behavior, criminality, and criminalization have been indicated by a limited number of epidemiological studies. The relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and the increase of these risks remains unclear. This is further impeded by the complexity of an FASD diagnosis, the lack of a clear dose-response relationship of brain impact to alcohol use, and the lack of a clear FASD behavioral phenotype. Literature with respect to FASD and crime is still in its infancy. From the studies available, it is recommended to pay close attention to individuals with FASD and the relation with the criminal justice system and the risk for discrimination. There is a clear need for FASD-related stigma reduction programs within the correctional system. Further investigations into reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment are needed."

In recent decades, scientists paid more attention to natural products and their derivatives because of their good tolerability and effectiveness in disease prevention and treatment. Olive oil is an essential component in the Mediterranean diet, a diet well known for its protective impact on human well-being. Investigation of the active components in olive oil, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, showed positive effects in various diseases. Their effects have been clarified in many suggested mechanisms and have shown promising results in animal and human studies, especially in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and other disorders. This review summarizes the current evidence of the role of olives and olive polyphenols in women's health issues and their potential implications in the treatment and prevention of health problems in women."

Updated alcohol-attributable fractions can contribute to improved estimates of the public health impact of excessive alcohol use. Peer-reviewed and gray literature for 1995-2019 on 15 causes of fatal nontraffic injuries in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico were systematically reviewed, and state data systems were queried for available estimates of fatalities with recorded blood alcohol concentration levels and proportions of decedents with blood alcohol concentrations ≥0.10 g/dL by cause of injury. For each injury cause, alcohol-attributable fractions across studies were synthesized by meta-analysis of single proportions using generalized linear mixed models. In total, 60 published studies and 40 additional population-level data points from 6 state data systems were included. The meta-analyzed alcohol-attributable fractions by cause of injury are as follows: air-space transport (0.03), aspiration (0.24), child maltreatment (0.09), drowning (0.31), fall injuries (0.37), fire injuries (0.34), firearm injuries (0.24), homicide (0.29), hypothermia (0.29), motor vehicle nontraffic crashes (0.42), occupational and machine injuries (0.08), other road vehicle crashes (railroad trespasser injuries) (0.63), poisoning (not alcohol) (0.20), suicide (0.21), and water transport (0.27), yielding an overall median alcohol-attributable fraction of 0.27. Excessive alcohol use is associated with substantial proportions of violent and nonviolent injury deaths. These findings can improve the data used for estimating alcohol-attributable injury deaths and inform the planning and implementation of evidence-based strategies (e.g., increasing alcohol taxes, regulating alcohol outlet density) to prevent them."

Alcohol consumption has been implicated in various neurocognitive deficits and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the impact of alcohol on BDNF blood levels remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of alcohol consumption on BDNF blood levels. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed, and methodological quality was assessed using appropriate tools. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effect size of alcohol consumption on BDNF levels. A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Alcohol use and BDNF blood levels were significantly correlated, according to the meta-analysis (p = 0.008). Overall, it was discovered that drinking alcohol significantly decreased BDNF levels (SMD: - 0.39; 95% CI: - 0.68 to - 0.10; I2: 93%). There was a non-significant trend suggesting that alcohol withdrawal might increase BDNF levels, with an SMD of 0.26 (95% CI: - 0.09 to 0.62; I2: 86%; p = 0.14). Subgroup analysis based on the source of BDNF demonstrated significant differences between the subgroups (p = 0.0008). No significant publication bias was observed. This study showed that alcohol consumption is associated with a significant decrease in BDNF blood levels. The findings suggest a negative impact of alcohol on BDNF levels regardless of alcohol dosage. Further studies are needed to strengthen the evidence and elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

Applying difference-in-differences and synthetic-control-group methods, we find that the ban had no effects on alcohol-related road casualties, but significantly reduced alcohol-related hospitalizations (doctor visits) among young people by around 9 (18) percent. The decrease is driven by fewer hospitalizations due to acute alcohol intoxication during the night-when the ban is in place-but not during the day."

It is unclear how alcohol consumption to common legal driving limits impacts upon this technology. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05% and of 0.08% on drowsiness detection technology during simulated driving. Participants completed a 60-min driving simulation and sleepiness questionnaire under three conditions: 1-0.00% BAC, 2-0.05% BAC and 3-0.08% BAC. During the driving simulation task participants wore a commercial eye blink drowsiness detection technology (Optalert) with the drowsiness alarms silenced. Twelve participants (3 female) completed all alcohol conditions. Relative to baseline, all eye blink parameters were affected at 0.08% BAC (all p < 0.05), whereas 0.05% BAC only affected the composite eye blink drowsiness measure (the Johns Drowsiness Scale). Alcohol consumption to 0.08% BAC impaired eye blink measures to a level that would be considered a moderate drowsiness risk. Therefore, employers should be aware that drowsiness alerts from these technologies may increase after alcohol consumption."

We aimed to identify, map and synthesise the available evidence on the commercial determinants of Indigenous health and well-being. Five academic databases (MEDLINE Complete, Global Health APAPsycInfo, Environment Complete and Business Source Complete) and grey literature (Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Google Scholar, Google) were systematically searched for articles describing commercial industry activities that may influence health and well-being for Indigenous peoples in high-income countries. Data were extracted by Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and narratively synthesised. 56 articles from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden were included, 11 of which were editorials/commentaries. The activities of the extractive (mining), tobacco, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, alcohol and gambling industries were reported to impact Indigenous populations. Forty-six articles reported health-harming commercial practices, including exploitation of Indigenous land, marketing, lobbying and corporate social responsibility activities. Eight articles reported positive commercial industry activities that may reinforce cultural expression, cultural continuity and Indigenous self-determination. Few articles reported Indigenous involvement across the study design and implementation. Commercial industry activities contribute to health and well-being outcomes of Indigenous populations. Actions to reduce the harmful impacts of commercial activities on Indigenous health and well-being and future empirical research on the commercial determinants of Indigenous health, should be Indigenous led or designed in collaboration with Indigenous peoples."

Considering the impact of AD, formulations of pharmaceutical drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely propagated, receiving endorsement by FDA as a form of AD treatment. However, these medications were gradually discovered to be ineffective in removing the root of AD pathogenesis but merely targeting the symptoms so as to improve a patient's cognitive outcome. Hence, a search for better disease-modifying alternatives is put into motion. Having a clear understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms and diverse properties undertaken by specific genes, antibodies and nanoparticles is central towards designing novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we provide a brief introduction on the background of Alzheimer's disease, the biology of blood-brain barrier, along with the potentials and drawbacks associated with current therapeutic treatment avenues pertaining to gene therapy, immunotherapy and nanotherapy for better diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease."

Being 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose, its intake was expected to reduce obesity rates in developing countries and help those struggling with diabetes. It is mainly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, confectionery, and medicines. Despite its widespread use, its safety remains controversial. This narrative review investigates the existing literature on the use of aspartame and its possible effects on the human body to refine current knowledge. Taking to account that aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener, it seems appropriate to continue research on safety. Studies mentioned in this article have produced very interesting results overall, the current review highlights the social problem of providing visible and detailed information about the presence of aspartame in products. The studies involving the impact of aspartame on obesity, diabetes mellitus, children and fetus, autism, neurodegeneration, phenylketonuria, allergies and skin problems, its cancer properties and its genotoxicity were analyzed. Further research should be conducted to ensure clear information about the impact of aspartame on health."

Although most often noninflammatory and bilateral, some drugs are associated with peripheral oedema that is readily erythematous (eg, pemetrexed) or unilateral (eg, sirolimus). Thus, drug-induced peripheral oedema is underrecognized and misdiagnosed, frequently leading to a prescribing cascade. Four main mechanisms are involved, namely precapillary arteriolar vasodilation (vasodilatory oedema), sodium/water retention (renal oedema), lymphatic insufficiency (lymphedema) and increased capillary permeability (permeability oedema). The underlying mechanism has significant impact on treatment efficacy. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the main causative drugs by illustrating each pathophysiological mechanism and their management through an example of a drug."

        "abstract": "Human resources for health (HRH) include a range of occupations that aim to promote or improve human health. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the WHO Health Workforce 2030 strategy have drawn attention to the importance of HRH for achieving policy priorities such as universal health coverage (UHC). Although previous research has found substantial global disparities in HRH, the absence of comparable cross-national estimates of existing workforces has hindered efforts to quantify workforce requirements to meet health system goals. We aimed to use comparable and standardised data sources to estimate HRH densities globally, and to examine the relationship between a subset of HRH cadres and UHC effective coverage performance. Through the International Labour Organization and Global Health Data Exchange databases, we identified 1404 country-years of data from labour force surveys and 69 country-years of census data, with detailed microdata on health-related employment. From the WHO National Health Workforce Accounts, we identified 2950 country-years of data. We mapped data from all occupational coding systems to the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO-88), allowing for standardised estimation of densities for 16 categories of health workers across the full time series. Using data from 1990 to 2019 for 196 of 204 countries and territories, covering seven Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) super-regions and 21 regions, we applied spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) to model HRH densities from 1990 to 2019 for all countries and territories. We used stochastic frontier meta-regression to model the relationship between the UHC effective coverage index and densities for the four categories of health workers enumerated in SDG indicator 3.c.1 pertaining to HRH: physicians, nurses and midwives, dentistry personnel, and pharmaceutical personnel. We identified minimum workforce density thresholds required to meet a specified target of 80 out of 100 on the UHC effective coverage index, and quantified national shortages with respect to those minimum thresholds. We estimated that, in 2019, the world had 104·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 83·5-128·0) health workers, including 12·8 million (9·7-16·6) physicians, 29·8 million (23·3-37·7) nurses and midwives, 4·6 million (3·6-6·0) dentistry personnel, and 5·2 million (4·0-6·7) pharmaceutical personnel. We calculated a global physician density of 16·7 (12·6-21·6) per 10 000 population, and a nurse and midwife density of 38·6 (30·1-48·8) per 10 000 population. We found the GBD super-regions of sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and north Africa and the Middle East had the lowest HRH densities. To reach 80 out of 100 on the UHC effective coverage index, we estimated that, per 10 000 population, at least 20·7 physicians, 70·6 nurses and midwives, 8·2 dentistry personnel, and 9·4 pharmaceutical personnel would be needed. In total, the 2019 national health workforces fell short of these minimum thresholds by 6·4 million physicians, 30·6 million nurses and midwives, 3·3 million dentistry personnel, and 2·9 million pharmaceutical personnel. Considerable expansion of the world's health workforce is needed to achieve high levels of UHC effective coverage. The largest shortages are in low-income settings, highlighting the need for increased financing and coordination to train, employ, and retain human resources in the health sector. Actual HRH shortages might be larger than estimated because minimum thresholds for each cadre of health workers are benchmarked on health systems that most efficiently translate human resources into UHC attainment.

        "abstract": "This paper reviews evidence of how drug control has been used to uphold colonial power structures in select countries. It demonstrates the racist and xenophobic impact of drug control policy and proposes a path to move beyond oppressive systems and structures. The 'colonization of drug control' refers to the use of drug control by states in Europe and America to advance and sustain the systematic exploitation of people, land and resources and the racialized hierarchies, which were established under colonial control and continue to dominate today. Globally, Black, Brown and Indigenous peoples are disproportionately targeted for drug law enforcement and face discrimination across the criminal system. These communities face higher arrest, prosecution and incarceration rates for drug offenses than other communities, such as majority populations, despite similar rates of drug use and selling among (and between) different races. Current drug policies have contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths, overdoses and sustained transnational criminal enterprises at the expense of the lives of people who use drugs, their families and greater society. This review provides further evidence of the need to reform the current system. It outlines a three-pillared approach to rebuilding drug policy in a way that supports health, dignity and human rights, consisting of: (1) the decriminalization of drugs and their use; (2) an end to the mass incarceration of people who use drugs; (3) the redirection of funding away from ineffective and punitive drug control and toward health and social programs."

Counterfeits are always inferior in terms of quality, safety and efficacy compared to the original pharmaceuticals, and subsequently, they pose an unpredictable risk to public health and lead to loss of confidence in medicines, healthcare providers, and health systems. In the decades before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a constant trend of increased trafficking was reported. However, the pandemic created a combination of public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic that made problematic the access and supply of high quality essential medicines and health products, and pushed consumers and vendors even more towards counterfeit pharmaceuticals. This contribution aims to review the trends in counterfeit drugs and pharmaceuticals trafficking, the health impact of their use, as well as, measures and actions implemented to restrict their proliferation, before and during COVID-19 pandemic; the relative recommendations, the expressed perspectives and the existing limitations are thoroughly discussed."

Canada has a complex system for drug approval and public reimbursement, with jurisdiction divided between the federal government and the provinces/territories. A pivotal role is that of health technology assessment (HTA), which relies primarily on health economic principles to analyze the value of drugs on a population health basis and make recommendations about public reimbursement. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) provides recommendations to all provinces but Quebec. This article provides an overview of Canada's approval and public reimbursement pathway, including the role of HTA and the economic principles on which it relies. Starting in late 2020, CADTH reduced the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold, the metric relied upon in making recommendations to public payers. An analysis of all 56 oncology drug final recommendations issued from January 2020 to January 2022 was conducted and confirms this reduction in the cost per QALY threshold. As a result of this threshold reduction, recommendations to the provinces include, in a number of cases, substantially greater price reductions. The potential implications for successful price negotiation with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA), the public negotiating body for the provinces, are discussed."

Treatment of obesity and its comorbidities often require the use of prescription drugs, many of which have not been fully evaluated in people with obesity. Despite a growing body of research on this topic, the impact of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs is often under-studied by drug sponsors and regulators, and subsequently underappreciated by clinicians and caretakers. There are currently multiple opportunities for pharmaceuticals to include dosing information specifically for patients with obesity in order to ensure safety and efficacy of drugs in this population. Additionally, there are serious gaps between what is known about the effects of obesity on drug disposition and the current use of drugs according to drug prescribing information and clinical practice. There is currently no requirement to test drugs in people with obesity during the drug approval process, even when preliminary data suggests there may be altered kinetics in this population. The lack of information on the safe and effective use of drugs in people with obesity may be contributing to poorer health outcomes in this population."

While the health impacts of mass incarceration have been explored, less attention has been paid to how the \"war on drugs\" in the United States exacerbates many of the factors that negatively impact health and wellbeing, disproportionately impacting low-income communities and people of colour who already experience structural challenges including discrimination, disinvestment, and racism. The U.S. war on drugs has subjected millions to criminalisation, incarceration, and lifelong criminal records, disrupting or altogether eliminating their access to adequate resources and supports to live healthy lives. This paper examines the ways that \"drug war logic\" has become embedded in key SDOH and systems, such as employment, education, housing, public benefits, family regulation (commonly referred to as the child welfare system), the drug treatment system, and the healthcare system. Rather than supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals, families, and communities, the U.S. drug war has exacerbated harm in these systems through practices such as drug testing, mandatory reporting, zero-tolerance policies, and coerced treatment. We argue that, because the drug war has become embedded in these systems, medical practitioners can play a significant role in promoting individual and community health by reducing the impact of criminalisation upon healthcare service provision and by becoming engaged in policy reform efforts.

We conducted a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence (PROSPERO CRD42020187295), searching bibliographic databases and grey literature. Given that an initial scoping search highlighted a scarcity of evidence specific to substance use treatment, evidence of disinvestment from publicly funded sexual health and smoking cessation services was also included. Data on disinvestment, political contexts and impacts were extracted, analysed, and synthesized thematically. We found 20 eligible papers varying in design and quality including 10 related to alcohol and drugs services, and 10 to broader public health services. The literature provides evidence of sustained disinvestment from alcohol and drug treatment in several countries and a concurrent decline in the quantity and quality of treatment provision, but there was a lack of methodologically rigorous studies investigating the impact of disinvestment. This review identified a paucity of scientific evidence quantifying the impacts of disinvestment on alcohol and drug treatment service delivery and outcomes. As the global economy faces new challenges, a stronger evidence base would enable informed policy decisions that consider the likely public health impacts of continued disinvestment."

        "abstract": "The absorption of oral drugs is frequently plagued by significant variability with potentially serious therapeutic consequences. The source of variability can be traced back to interindividual variability in physiology, differences in special populations (age- and disease-dependent), drug and formulation properties, or food-drug interactions. Clinical evidence for the impact of some of these factors on drug pharmacokinetic variability is mounting: e.g. gastric pH and emptying time, small intestinal fluid properties, differences in pediatrics and the elderly, and surgical changes in gastrointestinal anatomy. However, the link of colonic factors variability (transit time, fluid composition, microbiome), sex differences (male vs. female) and gut-related diseases (chronic constipation, anorexia and cachexia) to drug absorption variability has not been firmly established yet. At the same time, a way to decrease oral drug pharmacokinetic variability is provided by the pharmaceutical industry: clinical evidence suggests that formulation approaches employed during drug development can decrease the variability in oral exposure. This review outlines the main drivers of oral drug exposure variability and potential approaches to overcome them, while highlighting existing knowledge gaps and guiding future studies in this area."

Capacity building, personal growth, reduced/safer drug use, and other positive outcomes may or may not be experienced by PWUD involved in engagement activities. Indeed, PWUD may also encounter stigma and harm when interacting with healthcare and academic structures. Our objective is to uncover why, how, and under what circumstances positive and negative health outcomes occur during health system engagement by PWUD. We propose a realist review approach due to its explanatory lens. Through preliminary exploration of literature, lived experience input, and consideration of formal theories, an explanatory model was drafted. The model describes contexts, mechanisms, and health outcomes (e.g., mental health, stable/safer drug use) involved in health system engagement. The explanatory model will be tested against the literature and iteratively refined against formal theories. A participatory lens will also be used, wherein PWUD with lived experience of health system engagement will contribute throughout all stages of the review. We believe this is the first realist review to explore the contextual factors and underlying mechanisms of health outcomes for PWUD who participate in health system engagement. A thorough understanding of the relevant literature and theoretical underpinnings of this process will offer insights and recommendations to improve the engagement processes of PWUD."

        "abstract": "Although the launch delay of new drugs in China has been a deep concern during the past few years, research on this topic is scarce. The effect of recent regulatory efforts, such as initiating fast review channels to improve access to medical innovations, remains unclear. In this work, we measure the launch delay in China and study whether the fast channels contribute to shorter delays. We also offer an examination of the effect of launch delay on patients' health. We examined the launch delays of 40 new drugs engaged in the 3 national price negotiations in China. Launch delay was defined as the differences between the approval dates of the United States or the European Union and that of China and was measured according to approved indications of every specific drug. Thirty-four health impact models comparing the new drugs and their corresponding comparator therapies were populated with open data from published studies to assess the loss of health attributable to launch delay. The time horizon for each model was the specified delay time. A total of 40 new drugs with 54 approvals were studied. The median delay was 44.40 months (range, 7.30-196.24 months). For the 20 approvals granted with the fast channels, the median delay was 38.14 months, which was shorter than the 68.25 months of those 34 approvals on the track of standard procedure (P = 0.0276). Moreover, among the 34 health models for 27 new drugs, the largest loss of health was 5.76 life-years and 4.14 quality-adjusted life-years per potential patient, whereas the least loss was 0.006 life-years per head and 0.0035 quality-adjusted life-years per head, respectively. Access to new drugs is delayed significantly in China, which may undermine patient benefit by causing loss of life-years and quality of life. The fast review procedures in China have appeared to mitigate the launch delay."

We use the coarsened exact matching algorithm to compare the health outcomes for a treated group of patients living in a local health authority (LHA) where drug distribution through community pharmacies was restricted. These patients were matched to a control group of patients living in other LHAs, where drugs were also dispensed through a broad network of community pharmacies. We exploit a unique administrative dataset with information on the socio-demographic characteristics and health care services utilization of Ligurian patients with chronic cardiovascular and respiratory ailments. We restrict our analysis to patients 65 years of age or older who were admitted to hospitals from 2013 to 2016 with either a principal or secondary diagnosis connected to chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Reduced access to drugs leads to lowered drug consumption, a higher probability of adverse health outcomes including mortality, and a higher consumption of medical services in terms of hospitalizations and emergency room visits. These effects increase with patients' age. The pharmacy dispensing channel significantly affects drug consumption and acts as a proxy for adherence among chronically ill patients. Thus, health outcomes and health care utilization should be carefully evaluated when comparing the costs of alternative dispensing channels."

Peer-reviewed articles or published abstracts in any language with quantitative data on drug availability, use or related health and social harms collected before and after implementation of Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts and articles for inclusion. Extraction and quality appraisal (modified Downs and Black checklist) were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second, with discrepancies resolved by a third. We coded study-level outcome measures into metric groupings and categorised the estimated direction of association between the legal change and outcomes of interest. We screened 4860 titles and 221 full-texts and included 114 articles. Most (n=104, 91.2%) were from the USA, evaluated cannabis reform (n=109, 95.6%) and focussed on legal regulation (n=96, 84.2%). 224 study outcome measures were categorised into 32 metrics, most commonly prevalence (39.5% of studies), frequency (14.0%) or perceived harmfulness (10.5%) of use of the decriminalised or regulated drug; or use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs (12.3%). Across all substance use metrics, legal reform was most often not associated with changes in use. Studies evaluating drug decriminalisation and legal regulation are concentrated in the USA and on cannabis legalisation. Despite the range of outcomes potentially impacted by drug law reform, extant research is narrowly focussed, with a particular emphasis on the prevalence of use. Metrics in drug law reform evaluations require improved alignment with relevant health and social outcomes."

        "abstract": "The wide-spread implementation of interventions to limit transmission and public health consequences of COVID-19 in the Australian state of Victoria had flow-on consequences for people who use and inject drugs. Consequences included the interruption of illicit drug supply and drug procurement, and the disruption to the delivery of health services. To inform strategies that can minimise the adverse outcomes of similar future disruptive events, this study explored how COVID-19 restrictions impacted access to harm reduction and drug treatment services for people who inject drugs in Melbourne, Victoria. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted via an online calling app, with 11 participants of a broader cohort study (the SuperMIX study) in April 2020. Interviews were focused on participants experiences of accessing and using harm reduction and drug treatment services. Data were thematically analysed using a process of blended coding. Findings revealed how disruptions in the delivery of harm reduction and drug treatment services-in response to COVID-19 restrictions-created barriers accessing sterile injecting equipment, increased risk of arrest by police and exacerbated social isolation. Participants reported difficulties adapting to changes in services access, with some increases in injecting risk behaviours. However, improvements in opioid agonist therapy prescriptions were noted as a beneficial outcome. By examining the impacts of COVID-19 and the resultant restrictions on people who inject drugs' access to health services in Melbourne, Victoria, findings provide guidance for future responses to the unanticipated large-scale effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar disruptive events."

Policies such as the direct price ceiling, and the Essential Medicines Program-with the Zero Markup Drug Policy (ZMDP) one key component-were implemented, coming out with limited evidence for a success. As a benchmark of China's recent health reform, Sanming city initiated the ZMDP in January 2013; and further piloted the first reference pricing (RP) policy in China in September 2014, with the intention to dis-incentivize the use of costly original drugs. In this study, we used hospital-based drug procurement data of 14 drug substances that were subjected to the RP, from four hospitals in Sanming and a neighbouring city Longyan, between 2012 and 2016. Adopting the difference-in-difference (DID) approach, we evaluated the impacts of the RP together with the ZMDP. On the one hand, we found that the ZMDP had no impact on drugs' procurement prices, volumes and costs. While on the other hand, we found that the introduction of RP was not associated with changes in unit prices for the 14 drugs in Sanming. However, the RP pilot was associated with a 25.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.9-37.0%] decrease in monthly drug procurement volumes and a 47.7% (95% CI, 33.7-58.7%) decrease in the total drug costs. In particular, it reduced the procurement volumes of original drugs by 56.8% (95% CI, 47.0-64.7%). Subgroup analyses by hospital level and therapeutic class found similar results. We draw lessons for the Chinese government to experiment RP on a larger scale, considering the development and effective regulation of the generic market. This is a first report on the effects of RP in China, Asia and middle-income countries."

The implications of this research for human health, including microbiome links to obesity, drug metabolism, neurological diseases, cancer, and many other health conditions, have sparked considerable interest in exploiting the microbiome for targeted therapeutics. Links between microbial pathways and disease states further highlight a rich potential for companion diagnostics and precision medicine approaches. For example, the success of fecal microbiota transplantation to treat Clostridium difficile infection has already started to redefine standard of care with a microbiome-directed therapy. In this review we briefly discuss the nature of human microbial ecosystems and with pathologies and biological processes linked to the microbiome. We then review emerging computational metagenomic, metabolomic, and wet lab techniques researchers are using today to learn about the roles host-microbial interactions have with respect to pharmacological purposes and vice versa. Finally, we describe how drugs affect the microbiome, how the microbiome can impact drug response in different people, and the potential of the microbiome itself as a source of new therapeutics."

Yet, our understanding of their extent and impact is poor. We assess the available public domain evidence on the epidemiology of SF veterinary medicines, to better understand their prevalence and distribution and their public health impact on animals and humans. Searches were conducted in Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Global Health, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google and websites with interest in veterinary medicines quality up to 28 February 2021. Identified articles in English and French were screened for eligibility. The Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines were used to assess the quality of prevalence surveys. Three hundred and fourteen publications were included with a failure frequency (the percentage of samples that failed at least one quality test) of 6.5% (2335/35 733). The majority of samples were from post-marketing surveillance by medicines regulatory authorities of the Republic of Korea and China. A small proportion (3.5%) of samples, all anti-infectives, were from 20 prevalence surveys, with more than half (53.1%, 662/1246) collected in low-income and lower middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. The prevalence survey sample size ranged from 4 to 310 samples (median (Q1-Q3): 50 (27-80)); 55.0% of surveys used convenience outlet sampling methods. In 20 prevalence surveys more than half of the samples (52.0%, 648/1246) failed at least one quality test. The most common defects reported were out-of-specification active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) (API) content, failure of uniformity of units and disintegration tests. Almost half of samples (49.7%, 239/481) that failed API content tests contained at least one of the stated APIs below pharmacopoeial limits. Fifty-two samples (4.2% of all samples) contained one or more incorrect API. One hundred and twenty-three publications described incidents (recalls/seizures/case reports) of SF veterinary medicines in 29 countries. The data suggest that SF veterinary products are likely to be a serious animal and public health problem that has received limited attention. However, few studies of SF veterinary medicines are available and are geographically restricted. Lower API content and disintegration/dissolution than recommended by pharmacopoeial standards risks treatment failure, animal suffering and contribute to AMR. Our findings highlight the need of more research, with robust methodology, to better inform policy and implement measures to assure the quality of veterinary medicines within supply chains. The mechanism and impact of SF veterinary products on animal and human health, agricultural production, their economy and AMR need more transdisciplinary research."

I combine data from four sources: 1) standardized patient drug purchases; 2) vendor surveys; 3) real customer surveys; 4) public sector supply delivery dates. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that stockouts increase private-sector antimalarial drug prices by $0.68, or 35 percent. I find few changes in quality. Real customer characteristics change, suggesting that stockouts lead less educated and poorer customers to drop out of the market. Analysis using the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey additionally shows stockouts reduce treatment at public sector facilities and reduce the likelihood that children receive medicine. My results suggest that stockouts increase prices in the private sector and lead to less equitable health outcomes."

The aim of the study was to conduct a rapid survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug (PIED) use and training, and any subsequent negative physical or mental health outcomes. During 2020, a convenience sample of 60 PIED consumers (mean age = 26.69; 68.3% located outside Australia) completed a quantitative anonymous online survey exploring how the coronavirus pandemic impacted patterns of PIED use and associated exercise habits. The survey was administered via the Qualtrics platform and distributed online through PIED forums as well as through the investigators' networks. Participants were asked about their PIED use and exercise habits prior to and during restricted movement 'lockdowns'. During pre-COVID, the majority of the sample opted to 'blast-cruise' (an initial high dose, followed by a lower maintenance dose; 71.7%, n = 43). During lockdown, 45% (n = 27) reported a change in PIED use as a result of the restrictions. In light of health concerns during COVID-19, a majority of men (60%, n = 36) did not take any extra precautions relating to their PIED use. A subgroup of men ceased using PIEDs completely (16.7%, n = 10) with the majority (80%, n = 8) of that subgroup following post-cycle therapy (PCT) of some kind. Only a small proportion of the sample reported negative mental health issues as a result of PCT access issues. This study contributes to the emerging literature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, specifically PIED use among men. The results suggest that the pandemic did influence the choice of PIEDs that participants consumed, although there was little disruption to patterns of exercise, an important aspect of PIED use. Of the men who did cease use completely, the majority reported little issue with PCT access; those who reported difficulty accessing PCT compounds indicated experience some mental health concerns related to ceasing their PIED use. Clinicians and those who come into contact with this group should be alert for any negative physical or mental health concerns resulting from disrupted or ceased PIED use."

In order to make high-cost drugs viable in the public health network, the Specialized Pharmaceutical Assistance Component was created. However, despite the frequent incorporation of medications, the constant requirement of drugs through lawsuits leads to exorbitant costs to the state budget. The present work analyzed through a descriptive observational study, the current situation of the Specialized Component and the involvement of medicines used in dermatology, through legal reviews, financial analyses, and medical articles, aiming at future incorporations for the specialty. When assessing the legal demands for dermatological drugs in the state of São Paulo, the specialty still has a low participation and psoriasis is the main disease involved in requiring drugs through the judicial system in the state. New methods of access to raw materials must be created to reduce legal issues. Cost-effectiveness and public planning studies are mandatory for incorporating new dermatological therapies."

Drug transporters (DTs) and drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are key determinants of disposition, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Changes in their mRNA and protein expression levels and associated functional activity between the perinatal period until adulthood impact drug disposition. However, high-resolution ontogeny profiles for hepatic DTs and DMEs in nonclinical species and humans are lacking. Meanwhile, increasing use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models necessitates availability of underlying ontogeny profiles to reliably predict drug exposure in children. In addition, understanding of species similarities and differences in DT/DME ontogeny is crucial for selecting the most appropriate animal species when studying the impact of development on pharmacokinetics. Cross-species ontogeny mapping is also required for adequate translation of drug disposition data in developing nonclinical species to humans. This review presents a quantitative cross-species compilation of the ontogeny of DTs and DMEs relevant to hepatic drug disposition. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed Central: Tables and graphs (often after digitization) in original manuscripts were used to extract ontogeny data. Data from independent studies were standardized and normalized before being compiled in graphs and tables for further interpretation. New insights gained from these high-resolution ontogeny profiles will be indispensable to understand cross-species differences in maturation of hepatic DTs and DMEs. Integration of these ontogeny data into PBPK models will support improved predictions of pediatric hepatic drug disposition processes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Hepatic drug transporters (DTs) and drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) play pivotal roles in hepatic drug disposition. Developmental changes in expression levels and activities of these proteins drive age-dependent pharmacokinetics. This review compiles the currently available ontogeny profiles of DTs and DMEs expressed in livers of humans and nonclinical species, enabling robust interpretation of age-related changes in drug disposition and ultimately optimization of pediatric drug therapy."

In this review, we summarize our collective academic, government, and industry experiences regarding cellular nuisance compounds.

The recent increase in the consumption of modern human or veterinary drugs has resulted in a surge of anthropogenic pharmaceuticals, frequently introduced into terrestrial environments via untreated/treated wastewater. Pharmaceuticals display diverse degradation and accumulation behaviours in receiving bodies, however their impact on soils has, at large, been overlooked. Details about adsorption, absorption, degradation and uptake behaviours, as well as the fate and actual environmental impact of pharmaceuticals are a prerequisite before the traditional transportation prediction models originally designed for the aquatic environment can be extrapolated to terrestrial systems. Without this knowledge, our ability for informed risk assessments and the resultant implementation of contamination management strategies of soils will remain limited. This review discusses the current knowledgebase pertaining the introduction of pharmaceuticals to soils via wastewater irrigation or the application of biosolids. The focus on the transportation, transformation and accumulation of pharmaceuticals through the food chain highlights the urgent need to strengthen our capabilities concerning their detection and characterization in the terrestrial ecosystem."

To review systematically published studies on environmental impacts, including carbon dioxide equivalent (CO We followed the methods of systematic review and synthesis. We conducted searches in Medline, EMBASE and Scopus for primary studies and systematic reviews measuring environmental impacts of any type of cardiovascular healthcare published in 2011 and onwards. Studies were screened, selected and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Studies were too heterogeneous for pooling in meta-analysis and were narratively synthesised with insights derived from content analysis. A total of 12 studies estimating environmental impacts, including carbon emissions (8 studies), of cardiac imaging, pacemaker monitoring, pharmaceutical prescribing and in-hospital care including cardiac surgery were found. Of these, three studies used the gold-standard method of Life Cycle Assessment. One of these found the environmental impact of echocardiography was 1%-20% that of cardiac MR (CMR) imaging and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) scanning. Many opportunities to reduce environmental impacts were identified: carbon emissions can be reduced by choosing echocardiography as the first cardiac test before considering CT or CMR, remote monitoring of pacemaker devices and teleconsultations when clinically appropriate to do so. Several interventions may be effective for reducing waste, including rinsing bypass circuitry after cardiac surgery. Cobenefits included reduced costs, health benefits such as cell salvage blood available for perfusion, and social benefits such as reduced time away from work for patients and carers. Content analysis revealed concern about the environmental impact of cardiovascular healthcare, particularly carbon emissions and a desire for change.

        "abstract": "Universal access to sexual and reproductive health services is essential to facilitate the empowerment of women and achievement of gender equality. Increasing access to modern methods of contraception can reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy and decrease maternal mortality. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) offer high contraceptive efficacy as well as cost-efficacy, providing benefits for both women and healthcare systems. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) first became available in 1990 with the introduction of Mirena (LNG-IUS 20), a highly effective contraceptive which can reduce menstrual blood loss and provide other therapeutic benefits. The impact of the LNG-IUS on society has been wide ranging, including decreasing the need for abortion, reducing the number of surgical sterilisation procedures performed, as well as reducing the number of hysterectomies carried out for issues such as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mirena can provide a treatment option for women with gynaecological issues such as HMB without organic pathology, minimising exposure to the hospital environment and reducing waiting times for surgical appointments. Looking to the future, research and development in the field of the LNG-IUS continues to expand our understanding of these contraceptives in clinical practice and offers the potential to further expand the choices available to women, allowing them to select the option that best meets their needs."

        "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and affects people regardless of country, age group, or sex. Using the most recent evidentiary and analytical framework from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), we produced location-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific estimates of diabetes prevalence and burden from 1990 to 2021, the proportion of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 2021, the proportion of the type 2 diabetes burden attributable to selected risk factors, and projections of diabetes prevalence through 2050. Estimates of diabetes prevalence and burden were computed in 204 countries and territories, across 25 age groups, for males and females separately and combined; these estimates comprised lost years of healthy life, measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; defined as the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]). We used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach to estimate deaths due to diabetes, incorporating 25 666 location-years of data from vital registration and verbal autopsy reports in separate total (including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) and type-specific models. Other forms of diabetes, including gestational and monogenic diabetes, were not explicitly modelled. Total and type 1 diabetes prevalence was estimated by use of a Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to analyse 1527 location-years of data from the scientific literature, survey microdata, and insurance claims; type 2 diabetes estimates were computed by subtracting type 1 diabetes from total estimates. Mortality and prevalence estimates, along with standard life expectancy and disability weights, were used to calculate YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs. When appropriate, we extrapolated estimates to a hypothetical population with a standardised age structure to allow comparison in populations with different age structures. We used the comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the risk-attributable type 2 diabetes burden for 16 risk factors falling under risk categories including environmental and occupational factors, tobacco use, high alcohol use, high body-mass index (BMI), dietary factors, and low physical activity. Using a regression framework, we forecast type 1 and type 2 diabetes prevalence through 2050 with Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and high BMI as predictors, respectively. In 2021, there were 529 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 500-564) people living with diabetes worldwide, and the global age-standardised total diabetes prevalence was 6·1% (5·8-6·5). At the super-region level, the highest age-standardised rates were observed in north Africa and the Middle East (9·3% [8·7-9·9]) and, at the regional level, in Oceania (12·3% [11·5-13·0]). Nationally, Qatar had the world's highest age-specific prevalence of diabetes, at 76·1% (73·1-79·5) in individuals aged 75-79 years. Total diabetes prevalence-especially among older adults-primarily reflects type 2 diabetes, which in 2021 accounted for 96·0% (95·1-96·8) of diabetes cases and 95·4% (94·9-95·9) of diabetes DALYs worldwide. In 2021, 52·2% (25·5-71·8) of global type 2 diabetes DALYs were attributable to high BMI. The contribution of high BMI to type 2 diabetes DALYs rose by 24·3% (18·5-30·4) worldwide between 1990 and 2021. By 2050, more than 1·31 billion (1·22-1·39) people are projected to have diabetes, with expected age-standardised total diabetes prevalence rates greater than 10% in two super-regions: 16·8% (16·1-17·6) in north Africa and the Middle East and 11·3% (10·8-11·9) in Latin America and Caribbean. By 2050, 89 (43·6%) of 204 countries and territories will have an age-standardised rate greater than 10%. Diabetes remains a substantial public health issue. Type 2 diabetes, which makes up the bulk of diabetes cases, is largely preventable and, in some cases, potentially reversible if identified and managed early in the disease course. However, all evidence indicates that diabetes prevalence is increasing worldwide, primarily due to a rise in obesity caused by multiple factors. Preventing and controlling type 2 diabetes remains an ongoing challenge. It is essential to better understand disparities in risk factor profiles and diabetes burden across populations, to inform strategies to successfully control diabetes risk factors within the context of multiple and complex drivers.

        "abstract": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of kidney dysfunction that characteristically occurs in liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by a marked impairment of kidney function in response to circulatory and hemodynamic alterations that occur in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis, aggravated by systemic inflammation and bacterial translocation. The classical definitions of the types of HRS have been recently revisited and 2 forms of HRS have been redefined: the acute form, referred to as acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), and the chronic form, referred to as chronic kidney disease. HRS-AKI is one of the most severe forms of AKI in patients with cirrhosis and it consists of an abrupt impairment of kidney function, frequently triggered by an infection, appearing in the setting of advanced decompensated cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis with other causes of AKI is crucial because HRS-AKI requires a specific treatment. Differential diagnosis with AKI-acute tubular necrosis may be challenging and kidney biomarkers may be useful in this setting. Treatment of HRS-AKI is based on the administration of vasoconstrictor drugs in combination with volume expansion with albumin. Prognosis of HRS-AKI is poor, and the ideal definitive treatment consists of liver transplantation or simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. HRS-AKI has a big impact on patients' quality of life. Management of HRS-AKI remains challenging in specific situations such as alcohol-associated hepatitis or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease cirrhosis. Developing preventive measures for HRS-AKI, improving its early identification, discovering new biomarkers for differential diagnosis, and improving the response to therapy are some of the unmet needs in the field of HRS-AKI."

Dependence on amphetamines (AMPH) or methamphetamine (MA) is a growing global concern. Yet, there is no established pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence. A comprehensive assessment of the research literature on pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence may inform treatment guidelines and future research directions. We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature via the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for randomised controlled trials reported in the English language examining a pharmacological treatment for AMPH/MA dependence or use disorder. We included all studies published to 19 June 2019. The selected studies were evaluated for design; methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; sample size; pharmacological and (if included) psychosocial interventions; length of follow-up and follow-up schedules; outcome variables and measures; results; overall conclusions and risk of bias. Outcome measures were any reported impact of treatment related to AMPH/MA use. Our search returned 43 studies that met our criteria, collectively enrolling 4065 participants and reporting on 23 individual pharmacotherapies, alone or in combination. Disparate outcomes and measures (n = 55 for the primary outcomes) across studies did not allow for meta-analyses. Some studies demonstrated mixed or weak positive signals (often in defined populations, e.g. men who have sex with men), with some variation in efficacy signals dependent on baseline frequency of AMPH/MA use. The most consistent positive findings have been demonstrated with stimulant agonist treatment (dexamphetamine and methylphenidate), naltrexone and topiramate. Less consistent benefits have been shown with the antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine, the glutamatergic agent riluzole and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antagonist pexacerfont; whilst in general, antidepressant medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective in reducing AMPH/MA use. No pharmacotherapy yielded convincing results for the treatment of AMPH/MA dependence; mostly studies were underpowered and had low treatment completion rates. However, there were positive signals from several agents that warrant further investigation in larger scale studies; agonist therapies show promise. Common outcome measures should include change in use days. Future research must address the heterogeneity of AMPH/MA dependence (e.g. coexisting conditions, severity of disorder, differences between MA and AMPH dependence) and the role of psychosocial intervention."

Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to 20 February 2022. Randomised controlled trials of analgesic medicines (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anti-convulsant drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids) compared with another analgesic medicine, placebo, or no treatment. Adults (≥18 years) who reported acute non-specific low back pain (for less than six weeks). Primary outcomes were low back pain intensity (0-100 scale) at end of treatment and safety (number of participants who reported any adverse event during treatment). Secondary outcomes were low back specific function, serious adverse events, and discontinuation from treatment. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was done and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis method. 98 randomised controlled trials (15 134 participants, 49% women) included 69 different medicines or combinations. Low or very low confidence was noted in evidence for reduced pain intensity after treatment with tolperisone (mean difference -26.1 (95% confidence intervals -34.0 to -18.2)), aceclofenac plus tizanidine (-26.1 (-38.5 to -13.6)), pregabalin (-24.7 (-34.6 to -14.7)), and 14 other medicines compared with placebo. Low or very low confidence was noted for no difference between the effects of several of these medicines. Increased adverse events had moderate to very low confidence with tramadol (risk ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5)), paracetamol plus sustained release tramadol (2.4 (1.5 to 3.8)), baclofen (2.3 (1.5 to 3.4)), and paracetamol plus tramadol (2.1 (1.3 to 3.4)) compared with placebo. These medicines could increase the risk of adverse events compared with other medicines with moderate to low confidence. Moderate to low confidence was also noted for secondary outcomes and secondary analysis of medicine classes. The comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain are uncertain. Until higher quality randomised controlled trials of head-to-head comparisons are published, clinicians and patients are recommended to take a cautious approach to manage acute non-specific low back pain with analgesic medicines.

The effect of exercise on PTSD symptoms has previously been investigated in several studies. However, it has not been fully determined what type of exercise most impacts PTSD symptoms. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effects of different types of exercise on PTSD symptom severity and symptoms of coexisting conditions in adults. Electronic searches were conducted in the databases PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and SportDiscus, from database inception up until February 1, 2021. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials published in English, participants having a PTSD diagnosis or clinically relevant symptoms, and participants randomly allocated to either a non-exercising control group or an exercise group. Data concerning the number of participants, age, exercise type and duration, PTSD symptom severity (primary outcome), and symptoms of coexisting conditions (secondary outcomes) were extracted. The subgroup analysis included high or low training dose, military trauma versus non-military trauma, the type of intervention (yoga versus other exercise), active or passive control condition, group training versus individual exercise, and study quality. The study quality and risk of bias were assessed using grading of recommendation assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. A meta-analysis was performed with a mixed-effects model and restricted maximum likelihood as model estimator, and effect size was calculated as the standardized difference in mean and 95% CI. Eleven studies were included in the present review. Results showed a main random effect of exercise intervention (0.46; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.74) and a borderline significant interaction between more voluminous (>20 hours in total) and less voluminous (≤20 hours in total) exercise interventions (P = .07). No significant findings from the subgroup analysis were reported. The secondary outcome analysis showed a small but significant effect of exercise on depressive symptoms (0.20, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.38), and a larger effect on sleep (0.51, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.73). For substance use (alcohol and drugs combined) and quality of life, we found significant effects of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.98) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.69), respectively. No significant effect was found for anxiety (0.18, 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.51), and no sign of publication bias was found. Exercise can be an effective addition to PTSD treatment, and greater amounts of exercise may provide more benefits. However, as there were no differences found between exercise type, possibly due to the inclusion of a low number of studies using different methodologies, further research should aim to investigate the optimal type, dose, and duration of activity that are most beneficial to persons with PTSD."

AUD is highly prevalent and affects not only the individuals with AUD, but also their communities and society at large. Even though pharmacotherapy is an integral part of AUD treatment, the few available substances show limited efficacy and limited clinical impact. Thus, there is a need for new innovative pharmacotherapeutic approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive review of drugs approved for the treatment of AUD as well as those currently in phase II and III development. Data from recent clinical trials has been reviewed and supplemented by additional literature based on a systematic search of the PubMed database and clinical trials registries. Compounds discussed include disulfiram, naltrexone, nalmefene, acamprosat, baclofen, sodium oxybate, doxazosin, varenicline, zonisamide, gabapentin, apremilast, ibudilast, ivermectin, tolcapone, mifepristone, suvorexant, ketamine, psilocybin, semaglutide, oxytocin and cannabidiol. Even though the majority of the discussed compounds lack sufficient evidence to support their efficacy, multiple promising new treatment options are currently under investigation. Future research has to consider specific phenotypes and subgroups of AUD as well as a possible enhancement of the effects of psychotherapy through combination with pharmacotherapy. Practitioners should be encouraged to use available compounds to support existing therapeutic regimens."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination of anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist, plus zinc (A+Z) compared to prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule in patients with SAH. In this phase IIb double-blind randomized trial in adults with SAH and MELD scores of 20-35, participants were randomized to receive either daily anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously for 14 days plus daily zinc sulfate 220 mg orally for 90 days, or daily prednisone 40 mg orally for 30 days. Prednisone or prednisone placebo was stopped if Day-7 Lille score was >0.45. All study drugs were stopped for uncontrolled infection or ≥5 point increase in MELD score. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 90 days. Seventy-three participants were randomized to prednisone and 74 to A+Z. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis showed prednisone was associated with higher 90-day overall survival (90% vs. 70%; hazard ratio for death = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.83, p = 0.018) and transplant-free survival (88% vs. 64%; hazard ratio for transplant or death = 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.69, p = 0.004) than A+Z. Acute kidney injury was more frequent with A+Z (45%) than prednisone (22%) (p = 0.001), but rates of infection were similar (31% in A+Z vs. 27% in prednisone, p = 0.389). Participants with SAH treated with prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule had significantly higher overall and transplant-free 90-day survival and lower incidence of acute kidney injury than those treated with A+Z. There is no approved treatment for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (SAH). In this double-blind randomized trial, patients with SAH treated with prednisone using the Lille stopping rule on Day 7 had higher 90-day overall and transplant-free survival and lower rates of acute kidney injury compared to patients treated with a combination of anakinra and zinc. The data support continued use of glucocorticoids for patients with SAH, with treatment discontinuation for those with a Lille score >0.45 on Day 7. NCT04072822."

We hypothesized that triple therapy (LABA/LAMA/ICS) will be superior to LABA/LAMA in achieving and maintaining clinical control (CC), a composite outcome that considers both impact and disease stability in a subgroup of GOLD B patients (here termed GOLD B+ patients) characterized by: (1) remaining symptomatic (CAT≥10) despite regular LABA/LAMA therapy; (2) having suffered one moderate exacerbation in the previous year; and (3) having blood eosinophil counts (BEC) ≥150cells/μL. The ANTES B+ study is a prospective, multicenter, open label, randomized, pragmatic, controlled trial designed to test this hypothesis. It will randomize 1028 B+ patients to continue with their usual LABA/LAMA combination prescribed by their attending physician or to begin fluticasone furoate (FF) 92μg/umeclidinium (UMEC) 55μg/vilanterol (VI) 22μg in a single inhaler q.d. for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome will be the level of CC achieved. Secondary outcomes include the clinical important deterioration index (CID), annual rate of exacerbations, and FEV1. Exploratory objectives include the interaction of BEC and smoking status, all-cause mortality and proportion of patients on LABA/LAMA arm that switch therapy arms. Safety analysis include adverse events and incidence of pneumonia. The first patient was recruited on February 29, 2024; results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The ANTES B+ study is the first to: (1) explore the efficacy and safety of triple therapy in a population of B+ COPD patients and (2) use a composite index (CC) as the primary result of a COPD trial."

New user cohort study. Longitudinal commercial US claims data. New initiators of budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol or fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol between 1 January 2021 and 30 September 2023 who had a diagnosis of COPD and were aged 40 years or older. In this 1:1 propensity score matched study, the main outcome measures were first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (effectiveness) and first admission to hospital with pneumonia (safety) while on treatment. Potential confounders were measured in the 365 days before cohort entry and included in propensity scores. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The study cohort included 20 388 propensity score matched pairs of new users initiating single inhaler triple therapy. Patients who received budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol had a 9% higher incidence of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (hazard ratio 1.09 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.14); number needed to harm 38) compared with patients receiving fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol and an identical incidence of first admission to hospital with pneumonia (1.00 (0.91 to 1.10)). The hazard of first moderate COPD exacerbation was 7% higher (1.07 (1.02 to 1.12); number needed to harm 54) and the hazard of first severe COPD exacerbation 29% higher (1.29 (1.12 to 1.48); number needed to harm 97) among those receiving budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol compared to fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol. Prespecified sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings to the primary analysis. Budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol was not associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol.

        "abstract": "The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides a comprehensive assessment of health and risk factor trends at global, regional, national, and subnational levels. This study aims to examine the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the USA and highlight the disparities in health outcomes across different states. GBD 2021 analysed trends in mortality, morbidity, and disability for 371 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors in the USA between 1990 and 2021. We used several metrics to report sources of health and health loss related to specific diseases, injuries, and risk factors. GBD 2021 methods accounted for differences in data sources and biases. The analysis of levels and trends for causes and risk factors within the same computational framework enabled comparisons across states, years, age groups, and sex. GBD 2021 estimated years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost to premature mortality and YLDs) for 371 diseases and injuries, years of life lost (YLLs) and mortality for 288 causes of death, and life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We provided estimates for 88 risk factors in relation to 155 health outcomes for 631 risk-outcome pairs and produced risk-specific estimates of summary exposure value, relative health risk, population attributable fraction, and risk-attributable burden measured in DALYs and deaths. Estimates were produced by sex (male and female), age (25 age groups from birth to ≥95 years), and year (annually between 1990 and 2021). 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws (ie, 500 random samples from the estimate's distribution). Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. We found disparities in health outcomes and risk factors across US states. Our analysis of GBD 2021 highlighted the relative decline in life expectancy and HALE compared with other countries, as well as the impact of COVID-19 during the first 2 years of the pandemic. We found a decline in the USA's ranking of life expectancy from 1990 to 2021: in 1990, the USA ranked 35th of 204 countries and territories for males and 19th for females, but dropped to 46th for males and 47th for females in 2021. When comparing life expectancy in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories (excluding the USA as a whole), Hawaii (the best-ranked state in 1990 and 2021) dropped from sixth-highest life expectancy in the world for males and fourth for females in 1990 to 28th for males and 22nd for females in 2021. The worst-ranked state in 2021 ranked 107th for males (Mississippi) and 99th for females (West Virginia). 14 US states lost life expectancy over the study period, with West Virginia experiencing the greatest loss (2·7 years between 1990 and 2021). HALE ranking declines were even greater; in 1990, the USA was ranked 42nd for males and 32nd for females but dropped to 69th for males and 76th for females in 2021. When comparing HALE in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories, Hawaii ranked 14th highest HALE for males and fifth for females in 1990, dropping to 39th for males and 34th for females in 2021. In 2021, West Virginia-the lowest-ranked state that year-ranked 141st for males and 137th for females. Nationally, age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2021 for many leading causes of death, most notably for ischaemic heart disease (56·1% [95% UI 55·1-57·2] decline), lung cancer (41·9% [39·7-44·6]), and breast cancer (40·9% [38·7-43·7]). Over the same period, age-standardised mortality rates increased for other causes, particularly drug use disorders (878·0% [770·1-1015·5]), chronic kidney disease (158·3% [149·6-167·9]), and falls (89·7% [79·8-95·8]). We found substantial variation in mortality rates between states, with Hawaii having the lowest age-standardised mortality rate (433·2 per 100 000 [380·6-493·4]) in 2021 and Mississippi having the highest (867·5 per 100 000 [772·6-975·7]). Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised mortality rates throughout the study period, whereas Washington, DC, experienced the most improvement (a 40·7% decline [33·2-47·3]). Only six countries had age-standardised rates of YLDs higher than the USA in 2021: Afghanistan, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, South Africa, and the Central African Republic, largely because the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, and substance use disorders on age-standardised disability rates in the USA is so large. At the state level, eight US states had higher age-standardised YLD rates than any country in the world: West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arizona. Low back pain was the leading cause of YLDs in the USA in 1990 and 2021, although the age-standardised rate declined by 7·9% (1·8-13·0) from 1990. Depressive disorders (56·0% increase [48·2-64·3]) and drug use disorders (287·6% [247·9-329·8]) were the second-leading and third-leading causes of age-standardised YLDs in 2021. For females, mental health disorders had the highest age-standardised YLD rate, with an increase of 59·8% (50·6-68·5) between 1990 and 2021. Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised rates of YLDs for all sexes combined (12 085·3 per 100 000 [9090·8-15 557·1]), whereas West Virginia had the highest (14 832·9 per 100 000 [11 226·9-18 882·5]). At the national level, the leading GBD Level 2 risk factors for death for all sexes combined in 2021 were high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and tobacco use. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardised mortality rates attributable to high systolic blood pressure decreased by 47·8% (43·4-52·5) and for tobacco use by 5·1% (48·3%-54·1%), but rates increased for high fasting plasma glucose by 9·3% (0·4-18·7). The burden attributable to risk factors varied by age and sex. For example, for ages 15-49 years, the leading risk factors for death were drug use, high alcohol use, and dietary risks. By comparison, for ages 50-69 years, tobacco was the leading risk factor for death, followed by dietary risks and high BMI. GBD 2021 provides valuable information for policy makers, health-care professionals, and researchers in the USA at the national and state levels to prioritise interventions, allocate resources effectively, and assess the effects of health policies and programmes. By addressing socioeconomic determinants, risk behaviours, environmental influences, and health disparities among minority populations, the USA can work towards improving health outcomes so that people can live longer and healthier lives.

The current review examines the animal literature for impacts of comorbid alcohol and methamphetamine exposure. We found evidence for additive or synergistic effects of combined or sequential exposure on behavior and physiology. Dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems are all impacted by combined exposure to alcohol and methamphetamine and cyclooxygenase-2 activity plays an important role in their combined neurotoxic effects. Adverse consequences of comorbid exposure include altered brain development with prenatal exposure, impaired learning and memory, motor deficits, gastrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and augmented intake under some conditions. Given high susceptibility to drug experimentation in adolescence, studies of co-exposure during the adolescent period and of how adolescent exposure to one drug impacts later use or sensitivity to the other drug should be a priority. Further, to gain traction on prevention and treatment, additional research to identify motivational and neurobiological drivers and consequences of comorbid use is needed."

        "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1-78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5-80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8-81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9-34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6-4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9-4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3-0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5-0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4-0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3-13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7-2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3-2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9-1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

        "abstract": "Alcohol and cannabis are widely used recreational drugs that can negatively impact fetal development, leading to cognitive impairments. However, these drugs may be used simultaneously and the effects of combined exposure during the prenatal period are not well understood. Thus, this study used an animal model to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to ethanol (EtOH), Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or the combination on spatial and working memory. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to vaporized ethanol (EtOH; 68 ml/h), THC (100 mg/ml), the combination, or vehicle control during gestational days 5-20. Adolescent male and female offspring were evaluated using the Morris water maze task to assess spatial and working memory. Prenatal THC exposure impaired spatial learning and memory in female offspring, whereas prenatal EtOH exposure impaired working memory. The combination of THC and EtOH did not exacerbate the effects of either EtOH or THC, although subjects exposed to the combination were less thigmotaxic, which might represent an increase in risk-taking behavior. Our results highlight the differential effects of prenatal exposure to THC and EtOH on cognitive and emotional development, with substance- and sex-specific patterns. These findings highlight the potential harm of THC and EtOH on fetal development and support public health policies aimed at reducing cannabis and alcohol use during pregnancy."

Random effects Bayesian NMAs derived estimates of the mean difference in CFB in AQLQ vs. other interventions connected to the network (included 15 studies). Sensitivity analyses explored the impacts of differences in follow-up duration, baseline asthma control, the inclusion of observational studies, adjusting for baseline FEV Mean CFB in AQLQ with FP/Sal vs. comparators demonstrated expected ranked effects: mean difference 0.65 [95% credible interval: 0.54, 0.78] versus placebo, 0.58 [ 0.33, 0.84] versus LABA, 0.21 [ 0.13, 0.31] versus ICS alone, 0.06 [-0.04, 0.19] versus other ICS/LABA, and 0.00 [-0.13, 0.14] versus ICS/formoterol MART. Sensitivity analyses largely showed consistent results. Improvements in AQLQ and ACQ were strongly correlated (R = 0.94). This NMA demonstrates that HRQoL is responsive to treatment, is strongly related to asthma control and that it can be well-managed in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma using regular treatment with inhaled FP/Sal."

Lung function changes were similar, but symptom, physical activity limitation scores, and SABA use were higher, for severe versus moderate exacerbations. Lung function decline preceded increases in symptom, physical activity limitation scores, and SABA use, irrespective of exacerbation severity. Lung function variables, limitation scores, and SABA use returned to pre-exacerbation baseline after approximately 8 to 12 days for both exacerbation severities. Whereas severe events were associated with greater impact on symptoms, physical activity limitations, and SABA use, onset and time to resolution were generally similar for moderate and severe events. Both exacerbation severities represent clinically important deteriorations comprising clinical and functional changes."

Retrospective cohort study of patients with COPD and ≥1 prescription for single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT; fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol [FF/UMEC/VI] or beclomethasone dipropionate/glycopyrronium bromide/formoterol [BDP/GLY/FOR]) or multiple-inhaler triple therapy (MITT), using data from the AOK PLUS German sickness fund (1 January 2015-31 December 2019). The index date was the first date of prescription for FF/UMEC/VI or BDP/GLY/FOR (SITT users), or the first date of overlap of inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting β In total, 18,630 patients were identified as prevalent triple therapy users (MITT: 17,945; FF/UMEC/VI: 700; BDP/GLY/FOR: 908; non-mutually exclusive) and 2932 patients were identified as incident triple therapy initiators (MITT: 2246; FF/UMEC/VI: 311; BDP/GLY/FOR: 395; non-mutually exclusive). For both the prevalent and incident cohorts, more than two-thirds of patients experienced ≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation in the preceding 24 months; in both cohorts more BDP/GLY/FOR users experienced ≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation, compared with FF/UMEC/VI and MITT users. Overall, 97.9% of prevalent triple therapy users and 86.4% of incident triple therapy initiators received maintenance treatment in the 24-month pre-index period. In a real-world setting in Germany, triple therapy was most frequently used after maintenance therapy in patients with recent exacerbations, in line with current treatment recommendations. Triple therapy (a combination of three different respiratory inhaled medications) is recommended for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who experience repeated short-term symptom flare-ups when taking dual therapy (a combination of two different respiratory medications). Previously, patients had to take triple therapy using two or three separate inhalers. More recently, single-inhaler triple therapies have been developed, meaning patients can take all three different medications at the same time via one single inhaler. This study assessed the characteristics of patients who were already receiving triple therapy, or who started triple therapy (either via multiple inhalers or a single inhaler), in Germany between January 2015 and December 2019. In total, 18,630 patients who were already receiving triple therapy during the study period, and 2932 patients who newly started using triple therapy were included. The study reported that more than two-thirds of included patients had experienced at least one flare-up of COPD symptoms in the 2 years before starting triple therapy. Most patients had also received another therapy for COPD before starting triple therapy. A small proportion of patients started taking triple therapy after receiving no other therapy for COPD in the previous 2 years. The results of the study suggest that triple therapy for COPD in Germany is most often used in accordance with recommendations (patients already receiving therapy and experiencing repeated symptom flare-ups)."

Dopamine-boosting psychostimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are some of the most widely used substances among PLWH. Chronic use of these substances disrupts brain function, structure, and cognition. PLWH with SUD have poor health outcomes driven by complex interactions between biological, neurocognitive, and social factors. Here we review the effects of comorbid HIV and psychostimulant use disorders by discussing the distinct and common effects of HIV and chronic cocaine and methamphetamine use on behavioral and neurological impairments using evidence from rodent models of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments (Tat or gp120 protein expression) and clinical studies. We also provide a biopsychosocial perspective by discussing behavioral impairment in differentially impacted social groups and proposing interventions at both patient and population levels."

The objective of this INGENIOUS trial (NCT02297126) analysis was to determine whether conducting and reporting pharmacogenetic panel testing impacts ADE frequency. The trial was a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial, adapted as a propensity matched analysis in individuals (N = 2612) receiving a new prescription for one or more of 26 pharmacogenetic-actionable drugs across a community safety-net and academic health system. The intervention was a pharmacogenetic testing panel for 26 drugs with dosage and selection recommendations returned to the health record. The primary outcome was occurrence of ADEs within 1 year, according to modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In the propensity-matched analysis, 16.1% of individuals experienced any ADE within 1-year. Serious ADEs (CTCAE level ≥ 3) occurred in 3.2% of individuals. When combining all 26 drugs, no significant difference was observed between the pharmacogenetic testing and control arms for any ADE (Odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78-1.18), serious ADEs (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.58-1.40), or mortality (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.28-1.21). However, sub-group analyses revealed a reduction in serious ADEs and death in individuals who underwent pharmacogenotyping for aripiprazole and serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.85). In conclusion, no change in overall ADEs was observed after pharmacogenetic testing. However, limitations incurred during INGENIOUS likely affected the results. Future studies may consider preemptive, rather than reactive, pharmacogenetic panel testing."

While all methodologies estimated reductions in all-cause mortality, especially for men, there was substantial variability in the level of mortality reductions predicted. The indirect methodologies had lower predictions as the meta-analyses on elasticities and risk relations seem to underestimate the true values for Lithuania. Directly estimated effects of taxation based on the actual mortalities seem to best represent the true reductions in alcohol-attributable mortality.

Sangelose-based gels/films can serve as a potential viable alternative to gelatin and carrageenan in pharmaceutical applications. Glycerol (a plasticizer) and α-CyD (a functional additive) were added to Sangelose, and gels and films were prepared. The gels were evaluated by dynamic viscoelasticity measurements, and the films were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile tests, and contact angle measurements. Soft capsules were prepared using the formulated gels. The strength of the gels was affected when only glycerol was added to Sangelose and α-CyD addition resulted in rigid gels. However, the addition of α-CyD with 10% glycerol weakened the gels. Tensile tests suggested that glycerol addition affected the formability and malleability of the films, while α-CyD addition affected their formability and elongation properties. The addition of 10% glycerol and α-CyD did not affect the flexibility of the films, suggesting that the malleability and strength were impacted. Soft capsules could not be prepared by adding only glycerol or α-CyD to Sangelose. Soft capsules with favorable disintegration behavior were obtained upon adding α-CyD to gels along with 10% glycerol. Sangelose combined with a suitable amount of glycerol and α-CyD has preferable characteristics for film formation and may have potential applications in the pharmaceutical and health food sectors."

The study aimed to compare the effects of e-cigarette and tobacco smoke on periodontal stem cells using a multi-omics approach to understand gene regulation. This research studied primary human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) obtained from healthy donors. The cells were subjected to tobacco smoke, e-cigarette aerosol (both tobacco and menthol flavors), e-cigarette liquid (both tobacco and menthol flavors), or untreated conditions using an in vitro exposure system. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to profile the transcriptome and identify differential gene expression. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to conduct genome-wide histone modification mapping for H3K27me3. Transcriptome profiling was combined with histone modification characterization to understand gene regulatory mechanisms. The study compared the effects of smoke versus e-cigarette, aerosol versus liquid exposure, and tobacco versus menthol flavor on gene expression and epigenetic landscapes in the two oral stem cell populations. The use of tobacco smoke caused damage to the DNA and nucleus in GMSCs, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction in PDLSCs. Regarding e-cigarettes, the aerosol and liquid affected non-coding RNA expression differently. The chemokine CXCL2 was found to be downregulated by aerosol but upregulated by liquid in GMSCs. An integrative analysis revealed that the upregulation of CXCL2 caused by e-liquid involved reduced H3K27me3 and activation of distal enhancers. On the other hand, aerosol exposure maintained H3K27me3 levels, while direct e-liquid exposure resulted in genome-wide reductions in H3K27me3, particularly in enhancer regions. Overall, the specific delivery methods and components of e-cigarettes caused unique changes in the transcriptome and epigenome of oral stem cells. E-cigarettes affect oral stem cells differently than tobacco smoke. Their aerosol and liquid have varying impacts on gene expression and regulatory landscapes in oral cells. Multi-omics approaches are important to understanding the molecular changes caused by e-cigarette components. This can help with toxicological assessments and determine their impact on periodontal health. Transcriptome and epigenome profiling are powerful tools to examine the unique molecular mechanisms involved in cellular responses to e-cigarettes."

Health status was measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (higher ≥46.6 and lower < 46.6) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score (higher ≥17 and lower < 17); dyspnoea and bronchitis were assessed via an electronic diary (eDiary). Differential response to once-daily indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) 110/50 μg versus twice-daily salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC) 50/500 μg was assessed. Data from 3354 patients was analysed. The risk of exacerbations was lower in patients who had less severe health impairment (rate ratio [RR] [95% CI]): SGRQ-C, (0.88 [0.78, 0.99]); CAT, 0.85 [0.75, 0.96]) and lower dyspnoea (0.79 [0.69, 0.90]) at baseline versus those with more severe health impairment and higher dyspnoea, respectively. Compared with SFC, IND/GLY led to better prevention of moderate-to-severe exacerbations in the majority of groups studied. Patients with more severe health status impairment and greater symptom burden at baseline subsequently experienced more exacerbations in the FLAME study. IND/GLY was overall more effective in preventing exacerbations versus SFC, regardless of baseline symptom burden. Our results suggest that future studies on novel exacerbation therapies should consider targeting patients with higher symptom burden at baseline. NCT01782326."

        "abstract": "Corneal abrasion is a common disorder frequently faced by ophthalmologists, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Ocular antibiotics are one of the management options for corneal abrasion. A comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion is thus far unavailable, therefore we conducted this review to evaluate the current evidence regarding this important issue. To assess the safety and efficacy of topical antibiotic prophylaxis following corneal abrasion. Our objectives were 1) to investigate the incidence of infection with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion; and 2) to investigate time to clinical cure, defined as complete healing (re-epithelialization) of the epithelium, with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic with another antibiotic or placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion due to any cause. We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE classification. Our search of the electronic databases yielded 8661 records. We screened 7690 titles and abstracts after removal of duplicates. We retrieved 32 full-text reports for further review. We included two studies that randomized a total of 527 eyes of 527 participants in the review. One study was conducted in Denmark, and one was conducted in India. The two studies did not examine most of our prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. The first study was a parallel-group RCT comparing chloramphenicol ocular ointment with fusidic acid ocular gels (frequency was not clearly reported). This study enrolled 153 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion in Denmark with a one-day follow-up duration. No participants had secondary infection in the fusidic acid group, whereas three (4.1%) participants in the chloramphenicol group had a slight reaction (risk ratio [RR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 2.79; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-one (44.3%) participants in the fusidic acid arm and 34 (46.6%) participants in the chloramphenicol arm were cured (defined as the area of abrasion zero and no infection) at day 1 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Without providing specific data, the study reported that the degree of pain was not affected by the interventions received. The most common adverse events reported were itching and discomfort of the eye, which occurred in approximately one-third of participants in each group (low certainty evidence). A second multicenter, two-arm RCT conducted in India enrolled 374 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion who presented within 48 hours after injury. This study investigated the effect of a three-day course of either ocular ointment combinations of chloramphenicol-clotrimazole or chloramphenicol-placebo (all three times daily). At day 3, 169 (100%) participants in the chloramphenicol-clotrimazole arm and 203 (99%) out of 205 participants in the chloramphenicol-placebo arm were cured without any complication, defined as complete epithelialization of the cornea without evidence of infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; 374 participants; very low certainty evidence). Four participants assigned to the chloramphenicol-placebo arm experienced mild adverse events: two participants (1%) had mild chemosis and irritation, and two (1%) had small single sterile corneal infiltrates (low certainty evidence). Given the low to very low certainty of the available evidence, any beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing following a corneal abrasion remain unclear. Moreover, the current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. There is a need for a well-designed RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of ocular antibiotics in the treatment of corneal abrasion with a particular focus on high-risk populations and formulation of interventions."

The index date was the date of the first FF/UMEC/VI claim (September 2017-March 2019). The 12 months prior to index (baseline) were used to assess patient characteristics and outcomes; the 12 months following index (follow-up) were used to assess study outcomes. All patients had ≥ 30 consecutive days' supply of any ICS/LABA dual therapy during the 12 months prior to FF/UMEC/VI initiation. Subgroup analyses included patients with ≥ 30 consecutive days' supply of budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FORM) during baseline. Analyses of patients with ≥ 1 COPD exacerbation during baseline were reported as well. The overall population included 1449 patients (mean age 70.75 years; 54.18% female), of whom 540 were patients in the BUD/FORM subgroup. Significantly fewer patients experienced any exacerbation during follow-up versus baseline (overall population 53.49% vs 62.59%; p < 0.001; BUD/FORM subgroup 55.00% vs 62.41%; p = 0.004). Effects on exacerbation reduction were more pronounced among patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation during baseline. Lower COPD-related HCRU was observed during the follow-up compared with baseline for both the overall population and the BUD/FORM subgroup. Patients with COPD treated with ICS/LABA during baseline, including patients specifically treated with BUD/FORM and those with a history of ≥ 1 exacerbation, had fewer COPD exacerbations and lower COPD-related HCRU after initiating FF/UMEC/VI."

Recent theories attribute fibromyalgia to central sensitization syndromes, suggesting altered nociceptive processing leads to hyperalgesia and allodynia. Standardized effective treatments are currently lacking. Palmitoylethanolamide and melatonin have shown pain-relieving effects in chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia, with excellent safety. Our open-label study assessed the impact of a daily combination of 1200 mg of palmitoylethanolamide and 0.2 mg of melatonin on pain, sleep, and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients. Between June 2023 and March 2024, 50 patients (2016 ACR criteria) were treated and evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 4 months (1 month discontinuation). The assessments included VAS for pain, ISI for insomnia, HAQ for health assessments, and a tender points evaluation. The patients, averaging 54.12 years old with a 3:1 female-to-male ratio, showed significant improvements in VAS, ISI, and HAQ scores relative to their own baselines and a reduction in tender points at 1 and 3 months, which was maintained at 4 months. No adverse events were reported. This study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of a palmitoylethanolamide and melatonin combination as an adjunct therapy in fibromyalgia, highlighting its potential to reduce pain and improve sleep and quality of life."

Alcohol is an important risk factor for self-harm; however, little is known about its role in pesticide self-poisoning. This scoping review explores the role that alcohol plays in pesticide self-harm and suicide. The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review guidance. Searches were undertaken in 14 databases, Google Scholar, and relevant websites. Articles were included if they focussed on pesticide self-harm and/or suicide and involvement of alcohol. Following screening of 1281 articles, 52 were included. Almost half were case reports (n = 24) and 16 focussed on Sri Lanka. Just over half described the acute impact of alcohol (n = 286), followed by acute and chronic alcohol use (n = 9), chronic use, (n = 4,) and only two articles addressed harm to others. One systematic review/meta-analysis showed increased risk of intubation and death in patients with co-ingested alcohol and pesticides. Most individuals who consumed alcohol before self-harming with pesticides were men, but alcohol use among this group also led to pesticide self-harm among family members. Individual interventions were recognised as reducing or moderating alcohol use, but no study discussed population-level alcohol interventions as a strategy for pesticide suicide and self-harm prevention. Research on alcohol's role in pesticide self-harm and suicide is limited. Future studies are needed to: further assess the toxicological effects of combined alcohol and pesticide ingestion, explore harm to others from alcohol including pesticide self-harm, and to integrate efforts to prevent harmful alcohol use and self-harm."

In this study, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments have been used to investigate the drug solubilisation capabilities of the micelles that result from 10 wt% aqueous solutions of the non-ionic surfactant, Triton X-100 (TX-100). Specifically, we have investigated the solubilisation of saturation amounts of the sodium salts of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: ibuprofen and indomethacin. We find that the ibuprofen-loaded micelles are more non-spherical than the indomethacin-loaded micelles which are in turn even more non-spherical than the TX-100 micelles that form in the absence of any drug. Our simulations show that the TX-100 micelles are able to solubilise twice as many indomethacin molecules as ibuprofen molecules, and the indomethacin molecules form larger aggregates in the core of the micelle than ibuprofen. These large indomethacin aggregates result in the destabilisation of the TX-100 micelle, which leads to an increase in the amount of water inside of the core of the micelle. These combined effects cause the eventual division of the indomethacin-loaded micelle into two daughter micelles. These results provide a mechanistic description of how drug interactions can affect the stability of the resulting nanoparticles."

Tramadol is currently being explored as an option to manage fibromyalgia pain and other symptoms because of its inhibitory activity of reuptake of neurotransmitters, but its safety and efficacy have not yet been established in these patients. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol on the management of symptoms of the syndrome. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Opengrey, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for randomised controlled trials analysing the association between tramadol used for fibromyalgia either single-agent or in combination with other drugs. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for all included studies. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Four RCTs comprising 459 patients were included. Tramadol-either as a single-agent or in combination with an antidepressant or analgesic-had a positive effect on pain. Tramadol combined with analgesic showed improved quality of life over placebo as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire at 91 days. However, this difference did not hold for tramadol as a single agent against placebo. The evidence in these articles was rated \"low\" using the GRADE approach. No serious adverse events were reported. No improvement in depression and quality of sleep were observed. This systematic review found a dearth of clinical trials on tramadol in patients with fibromyalgia. Although the combination of monoamine and opioid mechanism of tramadol has shown positive effects for fibromyalgia, the available evidence is not sufficient to support or refute the use of tramadol in clinical practice for pain or symptom management.

As a result, it is essential to recognize the threat these potent drugs can cause when illicitly used. Specifically, introducing fentanyl as a drug adulterant has been shown to impact overdose rates drastically. In this regard, the Drug Enforcement Agency recently released a public safety alert announcing the new threat of a new adulterant called xylazine. Xylazine is a powerful animal sedative with a different mechanism of action when compared to illicit opioids such as heroin and fentanyl. Xylazine is typically injected intravenously via a syringe, often in combination with multiple other drugs. One of the most common drugs, xylazine, is taken in combination with fentanyl, with users of this drug combination describing xylazine as prolonging the euphoric sensation produced by fentanyl. Xylazine may cause adverse effects such as bradycardia, brief hypertension followed by hypotension, premature ventricular contractions, ataxia, slurred speech, sedation, and respiratory depression. Much of the recent literature on xylazine use in humans comes from case reports and review articles. Related to widespread use in veterinary medicine and increasing circulation in illicit drug markets, there is a critical need for public awareness and additional clinical-based studies to further increase understanding of mediated or modulated pharmacological effects of xylazine in humans. Further research is urgently needed to more clearly understand the implications of unregulated xylazine in the illicit drug market, to formulate public health interventions, and to implement harm reduction strategies."

The most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and Europe is steatotic liver disease (SLD), which includes metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated SLD, and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Effective treatment of these conditions is essential to reduce the liver disease burden, with promising approaches including treating cardiometabolic risk factors and excessive alcohol intake. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, both as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs, are gaining attention for their beneficial impact on cardiometabolic risk factors and excessive alcohol intake. In this review, we examine the molecular and clinical effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, focusing on their direct hepatic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis but also the indirect influence on cardiometabolic risk factors and excessive alcohol intake as key features of SLD. We also explore the future implications of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated SLD, alcohol-associated liver disease, and the potential challenges."

For patients with each type of eating disorder, a higher risk of all-cause mortality was observed relative to control subjects without SUDs among those who abused alcohol and/or cannabis (adjusted hazard ratios for the anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and unspecified eating disorder patients, respectively, were 11.28 [95% CI=7.01, 18.16], 5.86 [95% CI=3.37, 10.1], and 10.86 [95% CI=6.74, 17.50]), or hard drugs alone or in combination with alcohol and/or cannabis (adjusted hazard ratios, respectively, were 22.34 [95% CI=15.13, 33.00], 11.43 [95% CI=7.14, 18.28], and 15.53 [95% CI=10.15, 23.78]), than in those without SUDs (adjusted hazard ratios, respectively, were 3.21 [95% CI=2.43, 4.23], 1.24 [95% CI=0.88, 1.77], and 4.75 [95% CI=3.57, 6.31]). Control subjects with SUDs also exhibited an elevated risk of all-cause mortality relative to control subjects without SUDs, although to a much lesser extent than eating disorder patients with SUDs. SUDs have an additive effect on excess mortality in patients with eating disorders. The prevention and treatment of SUDs in this patient group is thus imperative to reduce mortality."

The Pan American Health Organisation's regional Strategy for Improving Mental Health and Suicide Prevention is an important milestone in tackling this challenge. However, absence of any focus on gambling as a potential risk to the health and wellbeing represents a serious omission in the Strategy. In this viewpoint, we review existing scholarship demonstrating unequivocal links between gambling and a variety of mental health conditions and related harms. This is followed by an empirically-grounded discussion of how commercial gambling has recently rapidly expanded across the region and how the risks of this expansion have not been sufficiently considered at the policy level. We then present emerging regional evidence of the negative mental health impacts of gambling expansion. The review concludes by proposing possible policy actions to improve control over the gambling industry and reduce ensuing harms on mental health and wellbeing in the region, with a focus on PAHO's remit."

        "abstract": "Complications arising from acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) are routinely managed by various pharmacological interventions. Despite decades of clinical application, the potential impact on neurological recovery has been largely overlooked. This study aims to highlight commonly administered drugs with potential disease-modifying effects. This systematic literature review included studies referenced in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to March 31st, 2021, which assess disease-modifying properties on neurological and/or functional recovery of drugs routinely administered following spinal cord injury. Drug effects were classified as positive, negative, mixed, no effect, or not (statistically) reported. Risk of bias was assessed separately for animal, randomized clinical trials, and observational human studies. We analyzed 394 studies conducting 486 experiments that evaluated 144 unique or combinations of drugs. 195 of the 464 experiments conducted on animals (42%) and one study in humans demonstrate positive disease-modifying properties on neurological and/or functional outcomes. Methylprednisolone, melatonin, estradiol, and atorvastatin are the most common drugs associated with positive effects. Two studies on morphine and ethanol report negative effects on recovery. Despite a large heterogeneity observed in study protocols, research from bed to bench and back to bedside provides an alternative approach to identify new candidate drugs in the context of SCI. Future research in human populations is warranted to determine if introducing drugs like melatonin, estradiol, or atorvastatin would contribute to enhancing neurological outcomes after acute SCI. Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are exposed to a wide range of medications treating health conditions arising as a consequence of the initial injury. The effect of providing patients with a large number of medications in the early period after injury, that is in the first days to weeks, on recovery from SCI, however, is typically not considered. This extensive and structured review of evidence from pre-clinical (animal) and clinical (human) studies quantifies these effects for the first time. 144 unique drugs or combinations of drugs previously reported to be administered in animal models or to patients with SCI have been studied for their effect on recovery across 486 distinct experiments. A small subset of drugs are associated with positive effects, and provide potential targets for further study to determine if they can be used to treat SCI."

Both conditions have many pathophysiological mechanisms in common, such as altered lipid and bile acid metabolism, and share some similar clinical features. Furthermore, metabolic risk factors and alcohol often co-exist in the same individuals and have recently been shown to act synergistically to markedly increase the risk of liver disease. Given the high prevalence and impact of this interaction, steatotic liver disease due to the combination of metabolic dysfunction and moderate-to-high alcohol intake has been termed MetALD in the new steatotic liver disease nomenclature, attracting the interest of the scientific community. Subsequent studies have investigated the prevalence of MetALD, which ranges from 1.7% to 17% in cohorts of patients with steatotic liver disease, depending on the population setting and study design. A few cohort studies have also assessed the prognosis of this patient population, with preliminary data suggesting that MetALD is associated with an intermediate risk of liver fibrosis, decompensation and mortality among steatotic liver disease subtypes. In this review article, we examine the clinical evidence and the experimental models of MetALD and discuss the clinical implications of the term for early detection and management. We provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the synergistic effect of alcohol and metabolic risk factors, possible screening strategies, the use of biomarkers and emerging models of care, as well as potential therapeutic interventions with a special focus on medications for MASLD, highlighting the most promising drugs for patients with MetALD."

We examined the health and economic costs of poisoning in BC for 2016, using a societal perspective, to support public health policies aimed at minimizing losses to society. Costs by intent, sex and age group were calculated in Canadian dollars using a classification and costing framework based on existing provincial injury data combined with data from the published literature. Direct cost components included fatal poisonings, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, ambulance attendance without transfer to hospital and calls to the British Columbia Drug and Poison Information Centre (BC DPIC) not resulting in ambulance attendance, emergency care or transfer to hospital. Indirect costs, measured as loss of earnings and informal caregiving costs, were also calculated. We estimate that poisonings in BC totalled $812.5 million in 2016 with $108.9 million in direct health care costs and $703.6 million in indirect costs. Unintentional poisoning injuries accounted for 84% of total costs, 46% of direct costs and 89% of indirect costs. Males accounted for higher proportions of direct costs for all patient dispositions except hospital admissions. Patients aged 25-64 years accounted for higher proportions of direct costs except for calls to BC DPIC, where proportions were highest for children younger than 15 years. Hospital care expenditures represented the largest direct cost of poisoning, and lost productivity following death represented the largest indirect cost. Quantifying and understanding the financial burden of poisoning has implications not only for government and health care, but also for society, employers, patients and families."

This was a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort study with long-term follow-up consisting of 5889 women. The cohort population has been followed at birth, and at ages of 1, 14, 31 and 46. In total, 3280 (55.7%) women were clinically examined and 2780 also underwent a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at age 46. Glucose metabolism indices were analyzed in former combined hormonal contraceptive users (n = 1371) and former progestin-only contraceptive users (n = 52) and in women with no history of hormonal contraceptive use (n = 253). Compared with women with no history of hormonal contraceptive use, those who formerly used combined hormonal contraceptives for over 10 years had an increased risk of prediabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-9.2) but not of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Former progestin-only contraceptive use was not associated with any glucose metabolism disorders. The results persisted after adjusting for socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol consumption, parity, body mass index and use of cholesterol-lowering medication. Former long-term use of combined hormonal contraceptives was associated with a significantly increased risk of prediabetes in perimenopausal women, which potentially indicates a need of screening for glucose metabolism disorders in these women."

However, conventional interventions relying on diet and exercise are inadequate for achieving and maintaining weight loss, thus there is significant market interest for pharmaceutical anti-obesity agents. For decades, receptor agonists for the gut peptide glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) featured prominently in anti-obesity medications by suppressing appetite and food reward to elicit rapid weight loss. As the neurocircuitry underlying food motivation overlaps with that for drugs of abuse, GLP-1 receptor agonism has also been shown to decrease substance use and relapse, thus its therapeutic potential may extend beyond weight management to treat addictions. However, as prolonged use of anti-obesity drugs may increase the risk of mood-related disorders like anxiety and depression, and individuals taking GLP-1-based medication commonly report feeling demotivated, the long-term safety of such drugs is an ongoing concern. Interestingly, current research now focuses on dual agonist approaches that include GLP-1 receptor agonism to enable synergistic effects on weight loss or associated functions. GLP-1 is secreted from the same intestinal cells as the anorectic gut peptide, Peptide YY"

We searched 12 databases from inception to December 2022, along with reference lists of eligible studies. We included studies of any design conducted in any country, reported in English, evaluating campaigns using social media alone or in combination with other media. We assessed study quality, extracted data, and completed a narrative synthesis. Eleven of 6,442 unique studies met inclusion criteria, spanning 17 countries, targeting diverse populations, and predominantly using repeated cross-sectional study designs. Most were of weak quality. Only three studies evaluated campaigns relying solely or primarily on social media. Two drink-driving campaigns had no behavioral impact, whereas two others found behavior change. Two of three studies targeting college student drinking found significant reductions in drinking after the campaign, but a third detected no differences in quality or duration of drinking. Only one study measured changes in attitudes, finding that the campaign significantly increased policy support for key alcohol policies. All studies noted awareness, but only six quantified short-term measures, showing increased campaign awareness. It is unclear from the peer-reviewed literature whether public health-oriented social media campaigns can influence alcohol consumption and related harms, attitudes, and/or awareness. Our review nevertheless indicates that social media campaigns offer potential in some populations to influence these outcomes. There is an urgent need for the public health field to test and rigorously evaluate social media's utility as a vehicle for influencing population-level alcohol consumption and related problems, attitudes, and awareness."

It is essential, however, to gain an understanding of the physico-chemical properties that drive performance in vivo. To elucidate these properties, drug-containing poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block polymeric NP formulations (or PNPs) were sub-divided into discrete size fractions and analyzed using a combination of advanced techniques, namely cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hard-energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Together, these techniques revealed a uniquely detailed picture of PNP size, surface structure, internal molecular architecture and the preferred site(s) of incorporation of the hydrophobic drug, AZD5991, properties which cannot be accessed via conventional characterization methodologies. Within the PNP size distribution, it was shown that the smallest PNPs contained significantly less drug than their larger sized counterparts, reducing overall drug loading, while PNP molecular architecture was critical in understanding the nature of in vitro drug release. The effect of PNP size and structure on drug biodistribution was determined by administrating selected PNP size fractions to mice, with the smaller sized NP fractions increasing the total drug-plasma concentration area under the curve and reducing drug concentrations in liver and spleen, due to greater avoidance of the reticuloendothelial system. In contrast, administration of unfractionated PNPs, containing a large population of NPs with extremely low drug load, did not significantly impact the drug's pharmacokinetic behavior - a significant result for nanomedicine development where a uniform formulation is usually an important driver. We also demonstrate how, in this study, it is not practicable to validate the bioanalytical methodology for drug released in vivo due to the NP formulation properties, a process which is applicable for most small molecule-releasing nanomedicines. In conclusion, this work details a strategy for determining the effect of formulation variability on in vivo performance, thereby informing the translation of PNPs, and other NPs, from the laboratory to the clinic."

However, there is no consensus on the optimal hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rate for HCWs. To systematically review the published literature to determine an optimal threshold for the HCW HHC rate associated with the lowest HAI incidence rate. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Online databases were searched using comprehensive search criteria for randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled studies, investigating the impact of the HCW HHC rate on HAI incidence rates in patients of all ages within healthcare facilities in high-income countries. Of the 8093 article titles and abstracts screened, 35 articles were included in the review. Most studies reported overall HAIs per 1000 patient-days and device-associated HAIs per 1000 device-days. Most studies reported HHC rates between 60% and 70%. Lower HAI incidence rates seemed to be achieved with HHC rates of approximately 60%. The studies included in this review were not originally designed to assess the impact of HHC on HAI incidence rates, but risk of bias was assessed in accordance with the predetermined exposure and outcome criteria. Eleven (31%) studies were deemed to have low risk of bias. Although HHC is part of the HCW code of conduct, very high HHC rates are difficult to reach. In observational studies, HHC and HAIs had a negative relationship up to approximately 60% HHC. Due to flaws in the study design, causality could not be inferred; only general trends could be discussed. Given the limitations, there is a need for high-quality evidence to support the implementation of specified targets for HHC rates."

        "abstract": "Aim Hand hygiene practice is still burdened by inadequate compliance, whether in the professional sphere by health professionals or in the non-professional sphere by lay population. Aim of this study was to map the hand hygiene knowledge and its compliance in the monitored group of people. Methods The research was conducted at the Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin of Comenius University in Bratislava (JFM CU) among seventy 3rd year students of General Medicine (medical study program), and Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health (non-medical study programs). Knowledge of hygienic hand washing according to the WHO guidelines from 2009 was investigated, as well as differences in the level of microbial contamination of hands after routine hand washing between the group that had been acquainted with hand hygiene protocols and the group that had not sufficiently. Results The results have shown that 32.9% of the students did not perform hygienic hand washing properly. The differences between the groups of students with and without the proper hand hygiene compliance in routine hand washing were not statistically significant. Conclusion The results of our survey have suggested that the reasons for decreased compliance with hand washing protocols may be related to forgetting to wash the hands or not being acquainted with hand washing protocols at all. The strategies focused only on one aspect of hand hygiene are, according to scientific literature, ineffective in the long term."

The study population included sixty-two high school students between fourteen and fifteen years of age (thirty males and thirty-two females). The response rate was 76.5%. The measurement of oral hygiene level was performed using the modified Green Vermilion Index (GVI). The values were recorded at baseline, one week, three months, and six months after education through motivational lecture and hands-on training was performed. Descriptive and nonparametric statistical methods were used in statistical analysis. Level of significance was 0.05. At the beginning of the study, the GVI of all examined subjects was 3.52 (SD = 0.70). One week after the motivational lecture and training, it decreased to 2.64 (SD = 0.69). Three months later, the level of plaque index had the lowest value (1.44; SD = 0.66). At the end of the study the level of plaque index increased to 2.52 (SD = 0.86). A significant oral hygiene improvement in adolescents as a result of education was presented. However, due to a decline in oral hygiene level six months after the education, there is a need for educational programmes continuity."

        "abstract": "Hand hygiene is the simplest and most effective measure for preventing healthcare-associated infections. Despite the simplicity of this procedure and advances made in infection control, hospital health care workers' compliance to hand hygiene recommendations is generally low. Nurses have the most frequent patient care interactions, and thus more opportunities to practice hand hygiene. As such, it is important to identify and understand determinants of nurses' reported compliance. Formative research was undertaken to assess the potential impact of several unexamined factors that could influence HH among nurses: professional role and status, social affiliation, social norms, and physical modifications to the work environment (as well as institutional factors like safety climate). A survey questionnaire was developed primarily to inform the creation of a behaviour change intervention. The survey looked at how these factors influence HH among nurses and sought to identify barriers and levers to reported hand hygiene. It was administered to a survey panel of acute care nurses, working in US hospitals, with a year or more of experience. Multivariate regression modelling suggested that reported hand hygiene compliance was most likely to be a function of a hospital management's communication openness, perceived performance by peers, increased interactions with patients and other staff members, and the reduction in stress, busyness, and cognitive load associated with role performance. A powerful, effective intervention on HH among nurses therefore could be directed at improving communication openness, consider the impact of perceived performance by peers, increase interactions with patients and staff, and determine how to reduce the stress and cognitive load associated with role performance."

        "abstract": "Effective hand hygiene is one of the most important measures for protecting nursing home residents from nosocomial infections. Infections with multi-resistant bacteria's, associated with healthcare, is a known problem. The nursing home setting differs from other healthcare environments in individual and organisational factors such as knowledge, behaviour, and attitude to improve hand hygiene and it is therefore difficult to research the influential factors to improve hand hygiene. Studies have shown that increasing knowledge, behaviour and attitudes could enhance hand hygiene compliance in nursing homes. Therefore, it may be important to examine individual and organisational factors that foster improvement of these factors in hand hygiene. We aim to explore these influences of individual and organisational factors of hand hygiene in nursing home staff, with a particular focus on the function of role modelling by nursing managers. We conducted a mixed-methods study surveying 165 nurses and interviewing 27 nursing managers from nursing homes in Germany. Most nurses and nursing managers held the knowledge of effective hand hygiene procedures. Hygiene standards and equipment were all generally available but compliance to standards also depended upon availability in the immediate work area and role modelling. Despite a general awareness of the impact of leadership on staff behaviour, not all nursing managers fully appreciated the impact of their own consistent role modelling regarding hand hygiene behaviours. These results suggest that improving hand hygiene should focus on strategies that facilitate the provision of hand disinfectant materials in the immediate work area of nurses. In addition, nursing managers should be made aware of the impact of their role model function and they should implement this in daily practice."

MIH severity was categorized into three groups:mild (n = 16), moderate (n = 16) and severe (n = 16).The modified-Quigley Hein plaque index (m-QHPI) was used to determine oral hygiene, and the gingival index (GI) and bleeding on probe (BOP) were used to determine the gingival status of each subject. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for binary comparisons and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple comparisons. The m-QHPI,GI and BOP were significantly higher in all individuals with MIH compared with the control group. The m-QHPI increased with the severity of MIH (P &lt; 0.001).The GI of the MIH-affected teeth had highly significant increases according to MIH severity (P &lt; 0.05). The mean BOP score for the entire mouth was significantly higher in patients with severe and moderate MIH than mild MIH (P &lt; 0.001). The mean BOP for affected teeth with moderate and severe MIH was significantly higher than the mean BOP of mildly affected teeth (P &lt; 0.05). The presence and severity of MIH might be associated with increased plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. © 2022 Australian Dental Association."

An electronic literature search was conducted in the following online databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and Education Source. Only full-text, peer-reviewed articles written in English were selected for review. The search yielded 18 articles with a wide range of study designs and methodologies. Five key themes emerged from the literature: health impacts, psychosocial environment, strategies for retention, contradictory findings, and implications for the Canadian Dental Care Plan. Dental hygienists experience many health, environmental, and psychosocial challenges in their day-to-day working life that affect their job satisfaction and overall willingness to remain in the profession. Strategies for retention are essential for maintaining the current dental hygiene workforce and can have a positive impact on the Canadian Dental Care Plan and its success. Cette revue narrative explore les études disponibles actuellement pour élargir la compréhension des expériences et de la satisfaction des hygiénistes dentaires dans leur milieu de travail, tout en suggérant des stratégies pour le maintien en poste des hygiénistes dentaires et en examinant les incidences potentielles des pénuries de personnel actuelles sur le Régime canadien de soins dentaires à venir. On a procédé à une recherche documentaire parmi la littérature électronique disponible dans les bases de données en ligne suivantes : PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL et Education Source. Seuls les articles en texte intégral, évalués par les pairs et rédigés en anglais ont été sélectionnés aux fins d’examen. La recherche a permis de réunir 18 articles qui employaient un large éventail de méthodologies et de modèles d’étude. Cinq thèmes clés sont ressortis de la documentation : les répercussions sur la santé, l’environnement psychosocial, les stratégies de maintien en poste, les conclusions contradictoires et les implications pour le Régime canadien de soins dentaires. Dans leur vie professionnelle quotidienne, les hygiénistes dentaires font face à de nombreux défis sanitaires, environnementaux et psychosociaux qui ont une incidence sur leur satisfaction au travail et sur leur volonté générale de rester dans la profession. Les stratégies de maintien en poste sont essentielles pour la fidélisation de la main-d’œuvre actuellement en poste dans le secteur de l’hygiène dentaire et peuvent avoir une incidence positive sur le Régime canadien de soins dentaires et sa réussite."

This systematic review aimed to identify and describe strategies used to teach the theory and practice of hand hygiene, determine impact on knowledge and practice, and identify need for future education and research. Ten studies met the criteria for review. Health care students' theoretical knowledge of hand hygiene and their ability to practise are suboptimal and should be improved before they have contact with vulnerable patients. Educational input can increase knowledge and practice but the methodological heterogeneity of the studies and lack of rigour make it impossible to determine which interventions are most likely to be successful. The literature provides little evidence upon which to base educational practice in this area. There is a need for multi-centred longitudinal studies to measure effectiveness of teaching methods over time."

Due to inadequate infrastructure to provide education, healthcare, and communication as well as religious teachings, women and girls are excluded from participation in many activities of daily living and community activities during menstruation. Evidence based research addressing menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal is scares. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective. This systematic review identifies knowledge gaps and targets for future research and interventions. Studies from Nepal that examined factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were identified through searches across six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Nepal Journals Online and Kathmandu University Medical Journal) in January 2019. The SEM is a public health framework that describes how health is impacted at multiple levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Key themes were identified, and factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were categorized as per the level of socio-ecological model (SEM). After a comprehensive literature review, twenty peer-reviewed publications, published between 2003 and January 2019 were included in this review. Eighteen studies were descriptive and two were interventional. The main outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Nine studies focused on knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, seven studies highlighted reproductive health issues, three studies focused on prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, and one on school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene, inadequate WASH facilities, no sex education and culturally restrictive practices makes menstruation a challenge for Nepali women. These challenges have negative implications on women and girls' reproductive as well as mental health and school attendance among adolescent girls. There are gaps in the evidence for high quality interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address needs identified at all levels of the SEM. Menstrual health and hygiene are major public health and social issues in Nepal, due to a lack of health and education infrastructure, gender-based disparities and restrictive cultural and social norms. This study reviewed the current state of research on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. The socio-ecological model (SEM)—a public health framework that examines individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy impacts on health—was employed to describe impacts on menstrual health and hygiene. After a comprehensive literature review, 20 papers were included in this analysis, of which 18 were descriptive and two were interventional. The primary menstrual health and hygiene outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Key themes identified were knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, reproductive health issues, prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. The study results indicated lower menstrual health and hygiene challenges arose from lack of education around menstruation, lack of proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, poor sex education, and culturally restrictive practices. These challenges negatively impact women and girls’ reproductive health as well as mental health and school attendance. There is need for high quality, effective interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address improvements in menstrual health and hygiene at all levels of the socio-ecological model."

Results: In the current study, we analyzed the oral health of diabetic patients within the age class of 11-80 years. We divided them into seven age groups: 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. Based on the results of the current study it was observed that 83.7% of patients were affected by gingivitis. The results of our study show that dental caries prevalence was 68.7 % and the prevalence of missing teeth among patients with diabetes mellitus was 78.7%. According to the ANOVA test, high blood sugar values had a direct impact on the manifestation of gingivitis and there it was a strong correlation between them P-value = .000. Males with diabetes mellitus were more affected by dental caries and this was indicated by the P-value= .02, in comparison to females who recorded a P-value = .03. The relation between gender males and missing teeth was highly significant P-value = .001. Conclusions: The present study proved that diabetes mellitus is risk factor for oral health. The authors studied this group of patients exposed to high blood glucose levels and found out that oral diseases were high in these patients."

Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) suffer from impaired cognitive function and a compromised ability to perform activities of daily living. Further exploration is needed to clarify whether OHRQoL is negatively impacted by cognitive degeneration and oral health conditions among patients with AD. The purpose of this systematic review was to increase understanding of OHRQoL among patients with AD and explore factors that may affect OHRQoL. Searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library database, Medline, EBSCO, ProQuest, and EMBASE until August 30, 2018, with no date restrictions. The initial search targeted quantitative observational studies published in English that included the keywords AD, oral, prosthesis, and OHRQoL. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. OHRQoL was investigated as the outcome. Cognitive status and oral health conditions were treated as exposures. Tools used to measure OHRQoL included the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) and the Oral Health Impact Profile. The research adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Six studies were included. The sample sizes ranged from 30 to 226 participants, 5 studies used cross-sectional designs, and 1 was a nonrandomized controlled trial. Three studies reported higher OHRQoL scores among participants with AD than those among controls, but only 1 study showed a statistically significant difference. A statistical analysis was conducted with 4 studies that reported GOHAI scores, and no significant differences were found in GOHAI scores between participants with AD and controls (standard mean difference: 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.66 to 0.85). All studies that explored factors affecting OHRQoL showed different associations between cognitive impairment, oral health conditions, and OHRQoL. One study showed that cognitive impairment was negatively associated with OHRQoL. Three studies found oral health conditions (including periodontitis, gingival bleeding, probing depth >4 mm, and number of natural teeth) impaired the OHRQoL of participants with AD. Three studies reported that prosthetic type and quality positively affected OHRQoL among participants with AD. OHRQoL may not fully represent actual oral health problems of patients with AD. Clinical dentists should evaluate oral problems in this population, preferably by using both subjective and objective examinations, including oral and dental conditions. This will ensure oral problems among patients with AD can be detected early and timely treatment provided."

Additionally, it aims to explore the impact of respiratory disease symptoms and treatments on the oral microbiome. The literature utilized in this review was sourced from studies focusing on the correlation between oral health and respiratory infections, spanning a period of 40 years. Various databases and scholarly sources were likely consulted to gather relevant research articles, reviews, and clinical studies. This review summarizes four decades-long research, providing insights into the intricate relationship between oral and respiratory health. It delves into how oral diseases influence respiratory tract conditions and vice versa. The selection process likely involved identifying studies that addressed the interaction between oral microbiome disruptions and respiratory complications. Oral diseases or poor oral habits have been known to increase the risk of getting respiratory infections. Modern techniques have demonstrated the relationship between oral disease and respiratory tract infections like influenza, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma, and Pneumonia. Apart from that, the medications used to treat respiratory diseases affect oral physiological factors like the pH of saliva, and saliva flow rate, which can cause significant changes in the oral microbiome. This review provides regular oral hygiene and care that can prevent respiratory health and respiratory infections. Understanding the intricate relationship between oral health and respiratory infections is crucial for healthcare providers. Implementing preventive measures and promoting good oral hygiene habits can reduce respiratory tract infections and improve overall respiratory health outcomes."

Intelligent technologies for hand hygiene are increasingly being developed as alternative or supplemental monitoring approaches. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in the literature. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of using intelligent technology for hand hygiene in hospitals. We searched 7 databases from inception to December 31, 2022. Two reviewers independently and blindly selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted. Overall certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The systematic review protocol was registered. The 36 studies comprised 2 randomized controlled trials and 34 quasi-experimental studies. The included intelligent technologies involved 5 functions: performance reminders，electronic counting and remote monitoring，data processing，feedback，and education. Compared with usual care, the intelligent technology intervention for hand hygiene improved health care workers' hand hygiene compliance (risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.47-1.66; P<.001), reduced health care-associated infection rates (risk ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.33; P<.001), and was not associated with multidrug-resistant organism detection rates (risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04; P=.07). Three covariates, including publication year, study design, and intervention, were not factors of hand hygiene compliance or hospital-acquired infection rates analyzed by meta-regression. Sensitivity analysis showed stable results except for the pooled outcome of multidrug-resistant organism detection rates. The caliber of 3 pieces of evidence suggested a dearth of high-caliber research. Intelligent technologies for hand hygiene play an integral role in hospital. However, low quality of evidence and important heterogeneity were observed. Larger clinical trials are required to evaluate the impact of intelligent technology on multidrug-resistant organism detection rates and other clinical outcomes."

        "abstract": "Influenza viruses are known to be infected through epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. The oral cavity is in close anatomical proximity to the upper respiratory tract, and it is conceivable that the viruses could pass through the oral cavity and infect to the upper respiratory tract. Several researchers have suggested that colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae might affect the risk of influenza viral disease, indicating that oral hygiene and/or condition might play an important role in respiratory viral infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether an oral hygiene/condition might impact influenza infection. We conducted a retrospective observational study of Japanese citizens' regional cohort (N = 2,904) consisting of National Health Insurance beneficiaries who underwent annual health/dental examination with data entries in the Kokuho database (KDB). Trained dentists checked the oral hygiene/condition, and saliva specimens were examined using the LION dental saliva multi-test (SMT) kit. Influenza infection was identified from the diagnosis recorded in the KDB. The correlations between influenza infection and oral hygiene, dryness of the mouth, or various salivary test results were examined by a multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, age, recent smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, HbA1c, RBC for influenza infection. The logistic regression model showed that age significantly correlated with influenza infection. In addition, oral hygiene status had a nearly significant impact on influenza infection (p = 0.061), whereby, the subjects with poor oral hygiene had a higher risk of influenza infection than those with good oral hygiene (odds ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.89-2.95). Further, the prevalence of influenza infection was lower in the subjects with saliva weakly acidic and/or containing higher protein level. The results of this study suggested that the maintenance of oral health conditions might be one of the pivotal factors for preventing and reducing influenza infection."

The main issues in the sustainability of hand hygiene automatic monitoring are healthcare worker (HCW) turnover rates and declining participation. To assess hand hygiene compliance and the impact of real-time reminders over three years. HCW compliance was observed for the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (AHR) on room entry and exit. Linear multi-level mixed models with time autocorrelations were performed to analyse the repeated measurements of daily room compliance and the effect of reminders over eight quarters (24 months). In all, 111 HCWs were observed and 525,576 activities were identified in the database. There was an improvement in compliance both on room entry and exit over two years, and the rooms which had activated reminders had better performance than the rooms which did not have activated reminders. This study showed the benefit of using real-time reminders; even 20% of rooms with an activated reminder improved overall hand hygiene compliance. A randomized real-time reminder setting may be a potential solution in reducing user fatigue and enhancing HCW self-awareness."

        "abstract": "Inadequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is an environmental risk factor for poor health outcomes globally, particularly for children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Despite technological advancements, many interventions aimed at improving WASH access return less than optimal results on long term impact, efficacy and sustainability. Research focus in the 'WASH sector' has recently expanded from investigating 'which interventions work' to 'how they are best implemented'. The 'acceptability' of an intervention is a key component of implementation that can influence initial uptake and sustained use. Acceptability assessments are increasingly common for health interventions in clinical settings. A broad scale assessment of how acceptability has been measured in the WASH sector, however, has not yet been conducted. We conducted a systematic literature review of intervention studies published between 1990 and 2021 that evaluated the acceptability of WASH interventions in LMIC settings. Using an implementation science approach, focused outcomes included how acceptability was measured and defined, and the timing of acceptability assessment. We conducted quality assessment for all included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised studies, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised studies. Of the 1238 records; 36 studies were included for the analysis, 22 of which were non-randomized interventions and 16 randomized or cluster-randomized trials. We found that among the 36 studies, four explicitly defined their acceptability measure, and six used a behavioural framework to inform their acceptability study design. There were few acceptability evaluations in schools and healthcare facilities. While all studies reported measuring WASH acceptability, the measures were often not comparable or described. As focus in WASH research shifts towards implementation, a consistent approach to including, defining, and measuring acceptability is needed."

It is the most debilitating neurological disease among young adults, causing personal, familiar, social, and professional limitations. Multiple sclerosis can cause disturbances in the orofacial district, due to a demyelination process on the nerves of the head and neck district. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral health status, dysphagia, and quality of life of patients affected by MS. For this study, 101 patients aged between 12 and 70 (47 males, 54 females) affected by MS were selected, and three questionnaires were handed out and anonymously filled in by them: An oral hygiene test, DYMUS (DYsphagia in MUltiple Sclerosis), and IOHIP-14 (Italian version Oral Health Impact Profile). Through the analysis of the questionnaires it was possible to observe pathological conditions, such as gingival inflammation, xerostomia, dysphagia, neuralgia, and dysarthria. Through the analysis it was possible to outline how the roles of a medical team, composed of a dentist, otolaryngologist, and dental hygienist, are fundamental in coping with other medical figures, during the whole development of the diseases, as well as to prevent possible complications."

Two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts of these; of which, 43 articles were reviewed in full. Of the 746 retrieved titles, 649 remained after removing duplicates. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria, and 13 were excluded. Also, two were included from the updated search. Data from the reviewed articles indicate that all three indicators of parent's socioeconomic status (income, education and occupation) are significantly associated with periodontal diseases in children. Better periodontal status was observed in children of parents with higher SES than those whose parents were of lower SES. Although the association between parent's smoking practices, level of periodontal diseases and children's periodontal status was explored only in few studies, findings indicate that children exposed to passive smoking and having parents with periodontal diseases are more likely to present with periodontal diseases as well. Most of the studies considered socioeconomic factors and had not attempted to explore the impact of parental psychosocial variables on periodontal diseases in children. The literature indicates that these variables significantly influence health practices, including oral hygiene practices, which could ultimately affect periodontal health. More studies are required to explore the association of these variables with periodontal outcomes in children."

A systematic search of publications using MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases was conducted in July 2020. The evidence-based librarianship (EBL) checklist assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Data were extracted using a pre-designed extraction tool, and a narrative analysis was undertaken. Following the search, 71 records were returned, with seven satisfying the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted between 2003 and 2015, and 57% (n = 4) of these employed a pre-post study design. The mean sample size was 155 participants (SD = ±117.6). All the included studies (100%, n = 8) identified that there was a direct relationship between the use of skincare bundles and the reduction in the incidence of skin tears in the elderly. The EBL scores varied between 65% and 91%. In total, 85.7% (n = 6) of the studies scored ≥75%, reflecting validity. This systematic review highlights the connection between skincare bundles and the reduction of the number of skin tears in the older population (≥65 years). Further research with larger sample sizes and longer study duration to validate these findings, which will provide a comprehensive insight into the prevention of the incidence of skin tears. Further studies are justified given that skin tear bundles can reduce the rate of injuries that are easily acquired by the elderly due to the nature of their frail skin, they also can help prevent skin tears from turning into chronic wounds and can decrease hospital admissions associated with hospital-acquired infections."

Factors such as extra vocal load, poor classroom acoustics, and health issues may increase a teacher's risk of acquiring a voice disorder that impacts his or her career. A common approach to treating or preventing voice disorders is the use of vocal hygiene training. Many studies have addressed different types of voice training with mixed results due to lengthy training programs, poor implementation, and other factors related to teacher motivation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether education on vocal hygiene practices would impact teachers' willingness to modify vocal behaviors. A group of 26 teachers from preschool to high school was sent pre- and post-training surveys to determine demographics, daily vocal use, and history of voice issues. The survey also assessed participants' likelihood to modify their behaviors to incorporate vocal hygiene practices into their daily lives. Between the pre- and post-training surveys, teachers received a one-hour training on vocal hygiene practices. This training consisted of basic information regarding the anatomy and physiology of the voice, healthy, and unhealthy vocal behaviors and the impact of phonotrauma behaviors, and positive effects of vocal hygiene techniques. Results showed that the impact of vocal hygiene training on teachers' willingness to incorporate vocally hygienic behaviors was statistically significant (d ≥ 0.80). Increases in study participant perceived desire to engage in vocal hygiene behaviors by virtue of vocal hygiene training was manifested in nearly 90% of the targeted vocal hygiene behaviors. In conclusion, teachers appear to benefit from receiving education on voice use and vocal hygiene techniques and show willingness to incorporate these techniques into their repertoires."

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hand hygiene performance (HHP) rates in acute care hospitals. HHP rates were estimated using an automated hand hygiene monitoring system installed in 74 adult inpatient units in 7 hospitals and 10 pediatric inpatient units in 2 children's hospitals. A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the 10 weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for 10 weeks after. Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at P < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for 4 weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period. Data from an automated hand hygiene monitoring system indicated that HHP shifted in multiple directions during the early stages of the pandemic. We discuss possible reasons why HHP first increased as the pandemic began and then decreased as it progressed."

The American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA) has contributed to and supported research that has formulated the scientific basis for the profession to inform education and practice. Progress has been made across multiple priority areas identified on the National Dental Hygiene Research Agenda, including educational research examining the impact of curriculum models on teaching and learning; health services research projects documenting workforce issues and cost-effectiveness of practice models; and public health initiatives expanding access to care to provide oral health care services for diverse patient populations. The Journal of Dental Hygiene, established in 1927, has played a significant role in disseminating scientific evidence to the global dental hygiene and professional communities. Collaborative efforts both within dental hygiene and externally with interprofessional partners and key stakeholders have positively contributed towards building the research infrastructure to support the profession. The number of dental hygienists who are actively engaged in research has increased, as has the value for research as part of the research culture. Focused research priorities and training efforts have encouraged collaborations across the globe to conduct and promote the science supporting dental hygiene education and practice. Development, testing and validation of theoretical frameworks is essential to drive all professional activities. Building a community of scholars who will continue to define the dental hygiene discipline through scholarship is critical to promote a scholarly identity for the profession."

At the global level, particularly in the developing world, WASH issues continue to present significant challenges. These challenges have been further intensified by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, climate change, water scarcity, and rising inequality. The scientific community has actively engaged in constructive discussions on these issues, as evidenced by the notable research findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to comprehensively examine and evaluate global knowledge on WASH. To search for relevant publications, the Scopus database was utilized using specific terms associated with WASH. VOSviewer 1.6.18 software was employed to generate network visualization maps, which assessed collaborative patterns and research trends in the field of WASH. The research output of countries was adjusted considering their gross domestic product (GDP) and population size. The total number of WASH-related publications, including all types of documents, was 1805. By narrowing the search to articles and reviews, the overall global productivity yielded 1589 documents: 1367 (86.0%) original articles and 222 (14.0%) review articles. The USA had the highest number of WASH publications (n = 668; 42.0%), followed by the UK (n = 396; 24.9%), Switzerland (n = 151; 9.5%), and Australia (n = 141; 8.9%). Ethiopia emerged as the leading country in terms of GDP per capita and the number of publications, followed by Uganda, Malawi, India, and Bangladesh. The USA, the UK, and Switzerland exhibited the most extensive collaboration among countries. The main research areas encompassed the role of WASH in sustainable development, the impacts of inadequate access to WASH services on gender equality, children, infants, and the outbreak of COVID-19 and other diseases, as well as the significance of hygiene practices and community and school-based WASH interventions in reducing infections. This study provides a novel analysis of global WASH-related research and highlights the distribution of outcomes across nations. Continued and increased collaboration between developed and developing nations will facilitate the sharing of responsibility for WASH research outcomes and the implementation of effective policies."

In each participating household, parents or guardians will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics, living conditions, domestic hygiene practices and potential alternative sources of exposure to lead. A registered nurse will collect hand wipe samples from children aged one to five years, for whom parental consent and where possible child assent has been obtained. Environmental dust samples will be collected from the floors and/or windowsills of children's dwellings for lead content analysis. Soil samples will be collected from yards to determine lead content. An educational intervention will then be applied to the intervention group, including the engagement of households or guardians in an educational discussion on the sources, pathways of exposure, health effects of lead exposure and protective measures, with the aid of a specially designed educational brochure. Data will be analysed for descriptive and inferential statistics using Stata version 16. The study will determine whether the intervention led to a reduction in indoor dust lead levels, and if shown to be effective, will inform the development of an awareness campaign to reduce lead exposure in communities located in close proximity to mine dumps.

We conducted a scoping review on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls' access to and utilisation of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for contraception, abortion, gender-based and intimate partner violence (GBV/IPV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We systematically searched peer reviewed literature and quantitative reports, published between December 2019 and July 2021, focused on women and girls' (15-49 years old) access to and utilisation of selected SRH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Included studies were grouped based on setting, SRH service area, study design, population and reported impact. Qualitative data were coded, organised thematically and grouped by major findings. We included 83 of 3067 identified studies and found that access to contraception, in-person safe abortion services, in-person services for GBV/IPV and STI/HIV testing, prevention and treatment decreased. The geographical distribution of this body of research was uneven and significantly less representative of countries where COVID-19 restrictions were very strict. Access was limited by demand and supply side barriers including transportation disruptions, financial hardships, limited resources and legal restrictions. Few studies focused on marginalised groups with distinct SRH needs. Reports indicated negative impacts on access to and utilisation of SRH services globally, especially for marginalised populations during the pandemic. Our findings call for strengthening of health systems preparedness and resilience to safeguard global access to essential SRH services in ongoing and future emergencies."

The methodology was a critical review that used immigration as a social determinant framework through which to evaluate its impact on the oral health of older immigrants. We reviewed recent empirical evidence on factors related to oral health in older immigrants. In a systematic search across multiple databases, we identified 12 eligible studies in this review. Among the eligible studies, most were conducted among East Asian immigrants (8 articles), followed by non-Hispanic White/European origin (2 articles), Mexican origins (1 article), and Iran and other Middle East regions (1 article). The research revealed knowledge gaps in the evidence base, including the dynamic relationship between acculturation and oral health, the role of environmental factors on oral health for immigrants, psychosocial stressors and their relationship with oral health, and oral health literacy, norms, and attitude to dental care utilization and oral hygiene practices. The development of the integrative framework suggests the pathways/mechanisms through which immigration exerts influences on oral health in later life. This provides opportunities for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to gain greater insights into the complex associations between immigration and oral health among older adults."

The analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on dietary habits and an ambiguous impact on oral health habits of the population. The researchers showed that patients' visits were limited only to those necessary, because of fear of infecting with the SARS-CoV-2. The literature review shows that the COVID-19 pandemic, by affecting many aspects of everyday life, including eating habits, caring for oral hygiene, and avoiding regular visits to the dentist, may generate an increase in oral diseases. Due to the differences in knowledge results, further research observations in this field are necessary."

        "abstract": "Viral illnesses have a significant direct and indirect impact on the workplace that burdens employers with increased healthcare costs, low productivity, and absenteeism. Workers' direct contact with each other and contaminated surfaces contributes to the spread of viruses at work. This study quantifies the impact of an office wellness intervention (OWI) to reduce viral load in the workplace. The OWI includes the use of a spray disinfectant on high-touch surfaces and providing workers with alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel and hand sanitizing wipes along with user instructions. Viral transmission was monitored by applying an MS2 phage tracer to a door handle and the hand of a single volunteer participant. At the same time, a placebo inoculum was applied to the hands of four additional volunteers. The purpose was to evaluate the concentration of viruses on workers' hands and office surfaces before and after the OWI. Results showed that the OWI significantly reduced viable phage concentrations per surface area on participants' hands, shared fomites, and personal fomites (p = 0.0001) with an 85.4% average reduction. Reduction of virus concentrations on hands and fomites is expected to subsequently minimize the risk of infections from common enteric and respiratory pathogens. The surfaces identified as most contaminated were the refrigerator, drawer handles and sink faucets in the break room, along with pushbar on the main exit of the building, and the soap dispensers in the women's restroom. A comparison of contamination in different locations within the office showed that the break room and women's restrooms were the sites with the highest tracer counts. Results of this study can be used to inform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models aimed at defining the relationship between surface contamination, pathogen exposure and the probability of disease that contributes to high healthcare costs, absenteeism, presenteeism, and loss of productivity in the workplace."

        "abstract": "The objective of this scoping review was to identify what is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the physical and mental well-being of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons. The aim was also to identify barriers influencing access to treatment or prevention. The search was conducted using PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. A mixed methods appraisal tool was used to assess methodological rigor. The study findings were synthesized using a thematic analysis approach. This review comprised 24 studies and were conducted utilizing a mixed method approach incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Two major themes were identified related to the impact of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons and the key barriers influencing access to treatment or prevention of COVID-19. They often have barriers to accessing healthcare due to their legal status, language barriers, and limited resources. The pandemic has further strained already limited health resources, making it even more challenging for these populations to receive healthcare. This review reveals that refugees and asylum seekers in receiving facilities face a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population due to their less favorable living conditions. The various health impacts stem from a lack of access to accurate information about the pandemic, misinformation, and the exacerbation of pre-existing mental health issues caused by heightened stress, anxiety, and uncertainty, fear of deportation among undocumented migrants, and overcrowding camps and detention facilities that increase exposure risk. Social distancing measures are difficult to implement in these settings, and inadequate sanitation, hygiene, and a lack of personal protective equipment further compound the problem. Moreover, the pandemic has had significant economic consequences for these populations. Many of them rely on informal or precarious employment, which has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Job losses and reduced working hours, and limited access to social protection can lead to increased poverty, and food insecurity. Children faced specific challenges, such as disruptions to education, additionally, interruptions in support services for pregnant women. Some pregnant women have avoided seeking maternity care due to fears of contracting COVID-19, resulting in increased home births and delays in accessing healthcare services. Factors that play a role in vaccination reluctance include uncertainty of undocumented migrants' inclusion in vaccination programs, furthermore, a growing vaccine hesitancy in the population; skepticism about the safety of vaccines, inadequate knowledge/education, a variety of access barriers such as language barriers, and logistical challenges including remote locations, and inaccurate information. This review highlights that the physical health of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons has been significantly impacted by various barriers to healthcare access during the pandemic. These barriers include legal and administrative challenges, such as a lack of documentation. Additionally, the shift to digital tools has introduced new obstacles, not only due to language barriers or limited technical knowledge but also because of structural barriers, such as the requirement of a bank ID that is often inaccessible to these groups. Other factors contributing to limited healthcare access include financial constraints, language barriers, and discrimination. Additionally, limited access to accurate information about health services, prevention measures, and available resources may hinder them from seeking care or following public health guidelines. Misinformation and lack of trust in healthcare systems can also contribute to a reluctance to access care or vaccination programs. There is concerning evidence regarding vaccine hesitancy that needs to be addressed to reduce any future pandemic outbreak, in addition there is a need to explore the factors that play a role in vaccination reluctance among children in these populations."

The search strategy was restricted to publications in English before 1 December 2019 in the PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus and Web of Science databases. We only included oral diseases considered as public health issues with a global burden. As a result, investigations reporting the frequency of brushing, poor lifestyle behaviours, non-white ethnicity, DMFT scores and periodontal disease as an outcome were included. The two reviewers resolved any disagreements. Reviewers analysed the full texts, considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, a manual search of the reference lists was performed on all the selected studies. In total, 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Findings indicate a positive association between non-white ethnicity and PQoL among PW. Among PW, those who had non-white ethnicity were 1.43 times more likely to have PQoL (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.70). A positive association between DMFT and poor QoL among PW was also observed. Those who has suffered DMFT were 1.4 times more likely to have poor QoL (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.55). Results from this meta-analysis support the need for behavioural interventions for improving oral hygiene in expectant mothers. This could help to decrease periodontal conditions and improve their oral and general life quality."

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess which living conditions have the greatest impact on handwashing practices. A cross-sectional epidemiological design of participants ≥16 y of age from San Juan de Miraflores, a slum on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, was used. Poisson regression was applied to assess the impact of living conditions on handwashing practices. We could not demonstrate a relationship between living conditions (home structure, overcrowding, water, grey water disposal) and reported handwashing. The reported lack of handwashing is associated with the number of children in the home (those with children <5 y of age were more likely not to report washing their hands) and length of stay in the slum in years. Living conditions play an important role in one's health, therefore improved study designs are needed to determine which strategies are likely to be the most effective in improving outcomes for slum dwellers."

Through a controlled intervention study, we tested faecal and water samples collected from both the intervention and control sites before and after the interventions using microbiological, immunological and molecular assays to determine the prevalence of diarrhoeagenic agents and microbial quality of water. Data from the hospital registers were used to estimate all-cause diarrhoea prevalence. After the interventions, we observed a 58.2% (95% CI: 39.4-75.3) decline in all-cause diarrhoea in the intervention site versus a 22.2% (95% CI: 5.9-49.4) reduction of the same in the control site. Besides rotavirus and pathogenic Escherichia coli, the rate of isolation of other diarrhoea-causing bacteria declined substantially in the intervention site. The microbial quality of community and household water improved considerably in both the intervention (81.9%; 95% CI: 74.5%-87.8%) and control (72.5%; 95% CI: 64.2%-80.5%) sites with the relative improvements in the intervention site being slightly larger. The integrated WASH, MNCH, nutrition and ECD interventions resulted in notable decline in all-cause diarrhoea and improvements in water quality in the rural resource-limited population in Kenya. This indicates a direct public health impact of the interventions and provides early evidence for public health policy makers to support the sustained implementation of these interventions."

To systematically review published evidence pertaining to the effect of modifiable risk factors on ECC. Twelve questions relating to infant feeding, diet, oral hygiene, and fluoride were addressed, as prioritized by a World Health Organization expert panel. Questions pertaining to the use of fluoride toothpaste were excluded due to its proven efficacy. The target population was children aged <72 mo. Data sources included Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PubMed, and all human epidemiologic studies were included. The highest level of evidence was used for evidence synthesis and, where possible, meta-analysis. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement, with evidence assessed via the GRADE method. Of the 13,831 papers identified, 627 were screened in duplicate; of these, 139 were included. The highest-level evidence indicated that breastfeeding ≤24 mo does not increase ECC risk but suggested that longer-duration breastfeeding increases risk (low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicated increased risk associated with consumption of sugars in bottles. Only 1 study had data on the impact of sugars in complementary foods, which increased risk. Moderate-quality evidence showed a benefit of oral health education for caregivers (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.80, The best available evidence indicates that breastfeeding up to 2 y of age does not increase ECC risk. Providing access to fluoridated water and educating caregivers are justified approaches to ECC prevention. Limiting sugars in bottles and complementary foods should be part of this education. This research is being used by the World Health Organization in developing a toolkit on the prevention and management of early childhood caries. The information will guide 1) governments in developing national oral health plans and 2) clinicians when providing preventive advice, including that regarding infant feeding practices. It will help ensure that advice is in line with current World Health Organization guidelines and the best available evidence."

This paper leverages teachers' perspectives on menstruation and the impact of the Menstrual Solutions (MS) study, an open cluster randomized controlled feasibility study to determine the impact of puberty education, nurses support, and menstrual product provision on girls' academic performance and emotional well-being. Seventeen focus group discussions were conducted from October 2012 through November 2013 with teachers at six participating schools, held at three different time points during the study period. Key themes that emerged were emotions and blood, absenteeism, the role of teachers in MHH, and the impact of sensitization. Teachers noted that poor MHH had an impact on school attendance, transparency and openness with teachers, and student behavior in class. It was reported that adolescent girls would absent themselves for 3-5 days during their menstrual cycle depending on what materials they could use, and they would often shy away from teachers, when possible, only speaking to them about their menses if it was urgent or they needed to go home. Emotions such as fear and embarrassment were commonly associated with bleeding. At the midpoint and end of the study, teachers noted that the puberty education and menstrual product provision (where applicable) had a positive impact on girls' attendance, attention, and comfort in the classroom. Girls became more open with both male and female teachers about their menses, and more comfortable and confident in the classroom among all classmates. This research highlights the importance of building an MHH-supportive environment with multiple school personnel within schools to develop a gender-equitable environment for girls to learn confidently without undue interference. Teachers are key adults in adolescent girls' lives, having the potential to foster an environment that empowers girls with greater autonomy to manage their menses. This highlights a need to consider their perspectives in intervention development. Sensitization of teachers and puberty education across both genders are key components to developing the MHH-supportive environment in schools."

Four databases were searched in November 2020 for relevant literature. Search terms included a comprehensive list of terms for adults 65 years or older receiving HHCS, clinical and subjective oral health indicators, and OHRQoL. The literature was reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the 3114 sources identified, 18 were included. Data on oral diseases and symptoms among older adults receiving HHCS were limited and heterogeneous. Overall, older adults often lacked some of their natural teeth and often had removable dentures that needed repair. In addition, plaque, caries, xerostomia, and chewing and swallowing problems were common among the population group. Data on OHRQoL were scarce and indicated a positive association with a higher number of present teeth, while decayed teeth, root remnants, and dry mouth had substantial negative impacts on the daily activities of older adults receiving HHCS. This scoping review show that older adults above 65 years receiving HHCS generally have poor oral health status and that there is a knowledge gap regarding their OHRQoL."

If effective interventions discontinue, new practices cannot reach wider student populations and investment in implementation is wasted. This review asked: What evidence exists about the sustainability of school-based public health interventions? Do schools sustain public health interventions once start-up funds end? What are the barriers and facilitators affecting the sustainability of public health interventions in schools in high-income countries? Seven bibliographic databases and 15 websites were searched. References and citations of included studies were searched, and experts and authors were contacted to identify relevant studies. We included reports published from 1996 onwards. References were screened on title/abstract, and those included were screened on full report. We conducted data extraction and appraisal using an existing tool. Extracted data were qualitatively synthesised for common themes, using May's General Theory of Implementation (2013) as a conceptual framework. Of the 9677 unique references identified through database searching and other search strategies, 24 studies of 18 interventions were included in the review. No interventions were sustained in their entirety; all had some components that were sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that was completely discontinued. No discernible relationship was found between evidence of effectiveness and sustainability. Key facilitators included commitment/support from senior leaders, staff observing a positive impact on students' engagement and wellbeing, and staff confidence in delivering health promotion and belief in its value. Important contextual barriers emerged: the norm of prioritising educational outcomes under time and resource constraints, insufficient funding/resources, staff turnover and a lack of ongoing training. Adaptation of the intervention to existing routines and changing contexts appeared to be part of the sustainability process. Existing evidence suggests that sustainability depends upon schools developing and retaining senior leaders and staff that are knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue delivering health promotion through ever-changing circumstances. Evidence of effectiveness did not appear to be an influential factor. However, methodologically stronger primary research, informed by theory, is needed. The review was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42017076320, Sep. 2017."

Multiple logistic regression was employed to explore associations between lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and tooth-brushing frequency. Around 10.8% of the students brushed their teeth less frequently than the recommended twice-daily regimen. Male gender, lower socio-economic status, poor dietary practice, longer sedentary time, drug use, psychological distress, less peer support, and no parental support were associated with infrequent tooth brushing. The findings support the need to integrate oral health promotion into general health actions that target families, schools, and social environments of adolescents to develop healthier habits."

        "abstract": "Many primary school children withhold urine and stool whilst at school for various reasons. Limited toilet access and the failure to provide safe, sanitary toilets are putting children at risk for toilet avoidance behavior. We aimed to examine personal hygiene, environmental conditions, the perception of these on children, and their toilet use in primary schools. Children aged 6-12 and their parents were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire regarding toilet behavior and the perception of school toilet standards. The main findings are listed below using the data from the questionnaire. We found that 9% and 63% of the children avoided urination and defecating at school, respectively. Similar results were reported previously. The participants' perceptions regarding the environmental conditions of school toilets and conditions revealed that 34% of the children felt that the toilets were dirty or very dirty. Around one-third of them reported a lack of toilet paper sometimes or most of the time. These unsatisfying hygienic conditions of school toilets can be easily solved. Unfortunately, 46% of the children in our study experienced bullying in school toilets. These worrisome data are seldom reported in other studies. The urination habits of the girls, who mostly preferred to partially squat or stand may lead to dysfunctional voiding and incomplete bladder emptying. Our study was limited by the relatively small population, the subjectiveness of the self-reporting questionnaire, and the voiding and defecation habits of the investigated children during school hours. These hours do not necessarily reflect the children's habits after school hours and during the weekends. Despite these limitations, the discussed issues regarding personal hygiene and the environmental conditions in the sampled primary schools are extremely important. Nearly half of the school children had negative perceptions of school toilets. This should raise awareness and concern for school staff to consider and investigate potential facilities improvement in light of the impact observed here. Implementation of appropriate education and a better environment of toilet facilities and security is important for the children's well-being."

        "abstract": "Chronic dental and oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease, continue to be a significant health problem among older adults. Given the rapidly changing profile of the ageing population, and their complex health needs, there is a need to develop new evidence-based approaches to oral health care. Recently, care philosophies have been developed that take a minimally invasive, functionally oriented, approach to oral health care with a focus on providing a reduced, but healthy, natural dentition which can be maintained with support of better oral hygiene. A review of the literature concerning use of minimal intervention dentistry (MID) to manage caries and toothloss in partially dentate older adults was undertaken. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents are available to prevent development of root caries and/or arrest root caries lesions, with professionally applied solutions (ie 22 500 NaF, 38% SDF or 40% CHX) every 3 to 6 months demonstrating best outcomes. Application of 38% SDF annually in high-risk, institutionalised older adults is effective in arresting root caries. Atraumatic restorative treatment can be used successfully to manage active carious lesions and limit the removal of natural tooth tissue. Finally, functionally oriented treatment planning to manage partial toothloss is successful in terms of quality of life impact and cost-effectiveness. Available evidence is somewhat limited and more long-term studies are need. However, currently available evidence suggests that minimal intervention dentistry can be predictable and cost-effective in older adults."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between oral hygiene and periodontal health status and the presence of pericoronitis in semi-impacted third molar teeth. A cross-sectional study was conducted, and 54 patients having at least one mandibular vertically semi-impacted third molar tooth with or without pericoronitis were consecutively enrolled. Subjects with pericoronitis and subjects with healthy third molars were selected according to symptoms in the gingiva overlying semi-impacted third molar teeth. Periodontal health status and oral hygiene were evaluated with the measures of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and total number of sites with a probing depth (PD) ≥ 4 mm. The clinical data collected in this study was analyzed with Mann-Whitney The PI scores were found to be significantly higher in patients with pericoronitis ( The findings obtained in this study suggest that the amount of dental plaque was positively associated with third molar pericoronitis. Gingival and periodontal health conditions were similar between patients with and without pericoronitis. Improving oral hygiene and controlling dental plaque may help prevent third molar pericoronitis."

Given the pressing need to enhance oral health among older adults, this scoping review aims to summarize the impact of OHL on oral health behaviors and outcomes in this population. The authors performed an electronic search up through July 22, 2024. Among the 2,226 articles identified, the authors included studies in which the investigators evaluated the association between OHL and oral health behaviors or outcomes restricted to individuals aged 60 years and older. Thematic analysis was used to develop the domain for oral health behaviors or outcomes. Among the 10 studies analyzed, significant correlations were identified between OHL and various oral health indicators, including periodontitis, the number of remaining teeth, dental prosthesis use, oral hygiene, oral health-related quality of life among men, as well as dissatisfaction with oral health (p < 0.05). However, the results were conflicting across the studies, indicating variability in the strength and nature of these associations. Additionally, OHL was shown to significantly influence oral health-related behaviors, especially the tooth brushing frequency (p < 0.05). This review highlights a scarcity of studies addressing OHL in older populations, suggesting that OHL has been deprioritized in efforts to improve oral health for this vulnerable group. Key gaps include the need for age-appropriate OHL assessment tools, stronger evidence linking OHL to specific oral health behaviors and outcomes, and the integration of OHL into broader health initiatives and research in older group. These areas are critical to advancing our understanding and improving oral health outcomes among older adults."

Previous studies indicate that oral health deteriorates throughout ventilation and may contribute to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Oral health at the time of initial ventilation may impact on this deterioration. To determine the quantitative clinical assessment methods used to measure oral health and what is currently known regarding the oral health of patients at the time of initial ventilation. A systematic literature search using electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library was undertaken for this scoping review. Studies were included if patients were >18 years old and mechanically ventilated for <48 h at the time of the first oral assessment. In total, 12 studies were included. The review demonstrates a limited understanding of clinical oral health at the time of initial ventilation. Significant variation in both assessment methods and reporting of oral health makes comparison of results difficult resulting in a poor overall understanding of oral health at the time of intubation. Standardized assessment and reporting methods may improve clinical application of findings and help direct future research. We suggest developing a core outcome set to ensure consistent use of assessment tools as well as standardized reporting of results. It is essential that a good understanding of oral health at the time of initial ventilation is gained so that patients receive more targeted oral hygiene intervention in ICU, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes."

Caregivers completed an online anonymous questionnaire. Aiming groups comparison, chi-square test was used for qualitative variables. 770 surveys were obtained. Significant changes in the children’s routine were higher in Portugal (p < 0.001). Both countries showed a large percentage of children who had between 2−3 snacks between meals (p < 0.001) and a higher consumption of snacks was particularly noticed among Spanish children with untreated dental caries during the lockdown (p = 0.003). Most caregivers reported children’s oral hygiene habits did not suffer noteworthy alterations (p = 0.417), although parental supervision of toothbrushing was associated with dental attendance during the lockdown. The majority of the sample had no dental attendance during confinement. Confinement appears to have not markedly affected the oral health status and habits of the majority of these children, although an important impact of some demographic and behavioral factors upon dietary and oral care/habits was detected."

This study aims to describe oral hygiene behavior (OHB) in terms of tooth brushing and professional scaling frequency among patients with chronic diseases. Secondarily, it aims to assess the association between OHB and periodontitis, tooth loss, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). This is a cross-sectional analysis of data of adult participants in the ComPaRe e-cohort. Participants were classified into having good, moderate, and poor OHB according to self-reported frequency of toothbrushing and professional tooth scaling. Periodontitis was assessed using the PEriodontal Screening Score (PESS). Weighted binary regression models were used to estimate the association between OHB and the following outcomes: (i) periodontitis; (ii) number of missing teeth; and (iii) OHRQoL based on the Oral Health Impact Profile-14. Overall, 8553 patients were included in the analyses (52.9% females, mean age of 56.3 ± 17 years). Of these, 2907 (34%), 3953 (46%) and 1693 (20%) were considered as having good, moderate, and poor OHB, respectively. Over half (54.1%) of the patients had a PESS ≥ 5 suggestive for severe periodontitis. Moderate OHB was associated with lower odds of PESS ≥ 5 compared to poor OHB (Adjusted Odds Ratio, OR = 0.81 [95%CI: 0.70-0.92]). Good and moderate OHB were significantly associated with lower odds of ≥ 10 missing teeth (OR = 0.26 [95%CI: 0.21-0.33] and OR = 0.47 [95%CI: 0.4-0.56], respectively) and better OHRQoL than poor OHB. Although, most of patients with chronic diseases reported to have good or moderate OHB, severe periodontitis is highly prevalent among this patient population in France. This study describes OHB in a representative sample of patients suffering from one or more chronic diseases and provides an estimate of the prevalence of self-reported severe periodontitis, missing teeth, and OHRQoL."

Licorice, a natural herb, could be a potential alternative to chlorhexidine. However, the effect of licorice mouthwash on the oral health of intubated patients has not been studied yet. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of licorice and chlorhexidine mouthwash on the oral health of intubated patients. This was a triple-blind clinical trial. The sample included 130 intubated patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Iran. The samples were selected by convenience sampling and randomly assigned to two groups: A and B. In group A, the main researcher applied 15 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash after each brushing (twice a day for 5.5 days) and suctioned it after 30 s. In group B, 20% licorice mouthwash was used instead of chlorhexidine. The demographic information questionnaire and the Beck Oral Assessment Scale (BOAS) were completed by one of the nurses before and on the sixth day of the study. Finally, 60 patients in each group completed the study. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of demographic variables or oral health before the intervention (P > 0.05). The oral health of patients in both the chlorhexidine and liquorice mouthwash groups improved significantly after the intervention (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in oral health between the two groups at postintervention (P = 0.06). The results demonstrated that both mouthwashes exerted a comparable effect on dental and oral health. However, the chlorhexidine mouthwash showed a greater impact on the reduction of dental plaque and the thinning of saliva compared to licorice mouthwash. In essential cases, licorice mouthwash can be employed as an alternative to chlorhexidine."

OHRQoL of home-dwelling older people with and without domiciliary care is a neglected area of research, with few studies having been conducted. A secondary analysis was conducted on the Finnish Health 2011 interview data. Home-dwelling participants (age ≥ 70) with or without domiciliary care were included (n = 758). OHRQoL was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile questionnaire (OHIP-14) calculating three outcomes: prevalence of at least one impact reported: \"occasionally,\" \"fairly often\" or \"very often\" (OFoVo), severity as mean sum score and mean of the seven OHIP-14 dimensions. These were evaluated by use of domiciliary care using logistic and negative binomial regression analyses. Domiciliary care clients tended to have poorer OHRQoL than non-clients (severity mean 4.33 vs 4.11, P = .057), especially men (6.71 vs 4.15, P = .027), and reported more psychological discomfort than non-clients (mean 1.10 vs 0.82, P = .039). The use of removable dental prostheses was the strongest predictor (OR 2.84, P < .001) of poor OHRQoL. Domiciliary care clients tended to report poorer OHRQoL, especially with regard to psychological discomfort dimension than non-clients. Thus, support of oral hygiene and regular utilisation of oral health services should be part of domiciliary care among older people to enhance OHRQoL."

Despite the passage of years and strenuous attempts to introduce these recommendations to the Polish health care facilities for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAI), these principles are still not being implemented in an optimal way for the patient's safety. The aim was to examine the views and attitudes of physicians (L) and nurses (P) towards the WHO rules of hand hygiene. The study was performed by means of a diagnostic survey using a questionnaire of our own design; random sampling was used. The study involved 231 LP: 173 (74.9%) women, 58 (25.1%) men, including 93 (40.3%) doctors and 138 (59.7%) nurses. The study was conducted in a multiprofile hospital in Małopolska in 2017. The difference between what the respondents think (their views) and what they do in reality (what attitudes they display) was examined in relation to WHO principles, such as wearing natural short nails and jewelry on their hands. Negative practice of observing these HH principles in relation to views was detected (R = -0.014, p<0.05, R2 = 0.016). Respondents supported the view that the ring could affect HAI and rarely used it in practice, the practice was positive (R = 0.298, p <0.001, R2 = 0.085). Women strongly emphasized the view that wearing long nails has an impact on HAI spread, but in practice they often declared keeping long nails, practice was negative (R = -0.241, p <0.01, R2 = 0.054). In response to the question about the impact of nail painting on the spread of HAI, this view was poorly represented, in practice some of them wore painted nails, the practice was negative (R = -0.226, p <0.01, R2 = 0.045). Despite high support for the principles of hand hygiene, in practice, these principles were not always respected, the impact on the practice was negative in areas such as: general adherence to the HH principles, wearing long and painted nails. The compatibility of views with practice was detected in relation to wearing a wedding ring."

        "abstract": "The In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts—both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world’s populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people’s lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating. The 2022 Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine—rather than protect—the future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding people’s health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all."

Aim of this study was to map the hand hygiene knowledge and its compliance in the monitored group of people. Methods The research was conducted at the Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin of Comenius University in Bratislava (JFM CU) among seventy 3rd year students of General Medicine (medical study program), and Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health (non-medical study programs). Knowledge of hygienic hand washing according to the WHO guidelines from 2009 was investigated, as well as differences in the level of microbial contamination of hands after routine hand washing between the group that had been acquainted with hand hygiene protocols and the group that had not sufficiently. Results The results have shown that 32.9% of the students did not perform hygienic hand washing properly. The differences between the groups of students with and without the proper hand hygiene compliance in routine hand washing were not statistically significant. Conclusion The results of our survey have suggested that the reasons for decreased compliance with hand washing protocols may be related to forgetting to wash the hands or not being acquainted with hand washing protocols at all. The strategies focused only on one aspect of hand hygiene are, according to scientific literature, ineffective in the long term."

Descriptive and nonparametric statistical methods were used in statistical analysis. Level of significance was 0.05. At the beginning of the study, the GVI of all examined subjects was 3.52 (SD = 0.70). One week after the motivational lecture and training, it decreased to 2.64 (SD = 0.69). Three months later, the level of plaque index had the lowest value (1.44; SD = 0.66). At the end of the study the level of plaque index increased to 2.52 (SD = 0.86). A significant oral hygiene improvement in adolescents as a result of education was presented.

The present study aimed to assess sports and energy drink consumption, oral health status and impacts on daily activities and sports performance among elite athletes from Pakistan. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics, sports and energy drink consumption, oral health and hygiene practices, self-reported oral health and psychosocial and performance impact was assessed using a self-administered, structured questionnaire followed by clinical oral examination by a single, experienced dentist. A total of 104 athletes, a majority of whom were male (80.8%), participated in the study. Around two third of the participants reported consumption of sports and energy drinks, energy gels or bars at least once a week, the commonest being Sting. Despite good oral hygiene practices, the athletes generally had poor oral health with high prevalence of dental caries (63.5%), gingivitis (46.1%), irreversible periodontitis (26.9%) and erosive tooth wear (21.2%). More than a quarter (28.8%) of the athletes rated their oral health as fair-very poor. Four in five athletes (80%) also experienced at least one oral problem with negative impacts on daily activities (64.4%) and participation training and sports performance (36.5%). Regression analyses revealed a significant association between periodontal disease and impact on both daily activities and sports performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that high-prevalence sports and energy drink consumption and oral problems among elite athletes from Pakistan has a negative impact on daily activities and sports performance. These findings may have important implications for oral health education programs, and the need to create awareness among the athletes regarding the use of sports and energy drinks, as well as regular oral health screening of athletes to minimize the impact on performance."

Several systematic reviews exist in the literature, but the diversity of settings, population considered, and type of violence investigated make it difficult to gain insight and use the vast amount of available data to implement policies to tackle WPV. With this in mind, we conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on WPV against HCWs to examine the global prevalence of the phenomena and its features. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science were searched for relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English up to November 2022. Data on authors, year, country, violence type, prevalence (pooled and not), setting, population, and specific considerations were extracted. A total of 32 systematic reviews were included, 19 of which performed a meta-analysis, investigating overall, physical, and non-physical violence. Even considering the variability of the data, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the scale of the problem. From our review, we found that overall violence prevalence among HCWs was reported to be as high as 78.9%, and nurses working in psychiatric wards were the professionals most impacted. In conclusion, this umbrella review revealed a high prevalence of WPV among HCWs, which varies between countries, population subgroups, and detection methods. Strengthening recognition of the problem could lead to appropriate local and international strategies to address it."

        "abstract": "Sewer overflow (SO), which has attracted global attention, poses serious threat to public health and ecosystem. SO impacts public health via consumption of contaminated drinking water, aerosolization of pathogens, food-chain transmission, and direct contact with fecally-polluted rivers and beach sediments during recreation. However, no study has attempted to map the linkage between SO and public health including Covid-19 using scientometric analysis and systematic review of literature. Results showed that only few countries were actively involved in SO research in relation to public health. Furthermore, there are renewed calls to scale up environmental surveillance to safeguard public health. To safeguard public health, it is important for public health authorities to optimize water and wastewater treatment plants and improve building ventilation and plumbing systems to minimize pathogen transmission within buildings and transportation systems. In addition, health authorities should formulate appropriate policies that can enhance environmental surveillance and facilitate real-time monitoring of sewer overflow. Increased public awareness on strict personal hygiene and point-of-use-water-treatment such as boiling drinking water will go a long way to safeguard public health. Ecotoxicological studies and health risk assessment of exposure to pathogens via different transmission routes is also required to appropriately inform the use of lockdowns, minimize their socio-economic impact and guide evidence-based welfare/social policy interventions. Soft infrastructures, optimized sewer maintenance and prescreening of sewer overflow are recommended to reduce stormwater burden on wastewater treatment plant, curtail pathogen transmission and marine plastic pollution. Comprehensive, integrated surveillance and global collaborative efforts are important to curtail on-going Covid-19 pandemic and improve resilience against future pandemics."

It has a significant impact on individuals across the lifespan and is a leading cause of preventable hospitalizations. The impacts of COVID-19 on oral health at the practice level are well documented, but gaps in understanding the impact on individual oral health remain. This review addresses this gap. Using a JBI scoping review process we mapped and summarized the evidence to identify the impact of COVID-19 on individual oral health. Key search terms were developed, and searches were undertaken by an experienced research librarian. The 85 included studies were conducted in 23 countries from 5 regions across the world classified using the United Nations Geoscheme system. The majority (82/85) were quantitative, 2 were reviews and there was one qualitative interview study. Cross-sectional surveys were the most common data collection approach followed by an analysis of clinical data, analysis of internet trends and other online methods. Five key areas were identified including changes to the provision of emergency dental services, provision of routine oral health services, oral hygiene maintenance at home, changes in dietary preferences, alternative models of dental provision and help-seeking and attitudes towards dental care in the future. This scoping review has demonstrated that the pandemic has impacted on oral health at the individual level. It is important that we are aware of these impacts and ensure that support systems are in place to overcome future periods where access to dental care might be compromised. The provision of preventive care remains a vital first step in ensuring good overall oral health as is paramount during periods where access to dental treatment might be limited."

The topic of bibliography review is based on the need to objectivize and systematically evaluate subjective health issues of Holocaust survivors in connection with trauma related to the stay in a concentration camp. The aim is to offer a review of effects of the Holocaust on health of different body systems for survivors in concentration camps and Jewish ghettos in the course of World War II. To map the subjective problems of Holocaust survivors, evidence-based medicine (EBM) method has been used with the help of scientific database PubMed, CINAHL Plus with full text, ProQuest and other sources with specific key words and Boole operators. Prognostic type of clinical/review questions has been selected for the bibliography review, which is trying to predict the probability of relation or output of illness/condition and based on diseases or symptoms seriousness to find out expectancy for treatment/improvement of care. 175 studies have been found in basic search with the use of key words both in English and in Czech language. The search has not been time-limited. The advanced search has focused on different body systems and health damage due to Nazi experiments. Fourteen studies have been used to complete the study. The research results have confirmed the significant effect of Holocaust trauma on body condition of the survivors. The reasons of this condition were insufficient nutrition, unsuitable and harmful hygienic, living and working conditions and brutality of the guards. According to the research, these factors have impacted all organ systems, mainly locomotion and cardiovascular ones. The results have shown a more frequent occurrence of osteoporosis, fractures of long bones and corresponding chronical pain of people of Jewish origin who had gone through different forms of torture during World War II. Other present symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, tumors mainly in the area of colorectum and lungs. Moreover, the stay in concentration camps had influence on women's menstrual cycle. The studies of Holocaust effects are an example of the influence of an extreme mental and physical burden on the body condition of the survivors' health. The results of the studies have shown a wide range of the effects also in mental and social areas."

We aimed to synthesise evidence related to public health measures and VOC. A rapid scoping review. On 11 May 2021, seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Central Register of Controlled Trials, Epistemonikos' L-OVE on COVID-19, medRxiv, bioRxiv) were searched for terms related to VOC, public health measures, transmission and health systems. No limit was placed on date of publication. Studies were included if they reported on any of the four VOCs and public health measures, and were available in English. Only studies reporting on data collected after October 2020, when the first VOC was reported, were included. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Data extraction was completed by two independent reviewers using a standardised form. Data synthesis and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Of the 37 included studies, the majority assessed the impact of Alpha (n=32) and were conducted in Europe (n=12) or the UK (n=9). Most were modelling studies (n=28) and preprints (n=28). The majority of studies reported on infection control measures (n=17), followed by modifying approaches to vaccines (n=13), physical distancing (n=6) and either mask wearing, testing or hand washing (n=2). Findings suggest an accelerated vaccine rollout is needed to mitigate the spread of VOC. The increased severity of VOC requires proactive public health measures to control their spread. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence for continued implementation of public health measures in conjunction with vaccine rollout. With no studies reporting on Delta, there is a need for further research on this and other emerging VOC on public health measures."

This construct includes four dimensions (4D): Oral Function, Orofacial Pain, Orofacial Appearance, and Psychosocial Impact. This study updates previous work characterizing 4D OHRQoL impairment among patients in dental hygiene (DH) and dental therapy (DT) settings. An expert panel revised previously determined DH and DT patient population groups to align them with current scopes of practice. An updated systematic review was then conducted to incorporate recent studies using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) to assess 4D OHRQoL in these populations. The search spanned 6 databases from January 1, 2023, to April 16, 2024. The panel identified 20 patient populations, representing the scope of DH and DT practice. The systematic review contained 19 studies (17 from the previous review and 2 new ones). Studies' OHRQoL data covered only 30 % of dental hygiene and dental therapy patient populations identified by the panel. The most frequently studied group was \"therapeutic periodontal treatment-patients with periodontitis\" (n = 17, 89 %), followed by \"oral hygiene instructions-all patients\" (n = 13, 68 %). Only four studies provided 4D OHRQoL data, showing the greatest impacts in Orofacial Pain (baseline OHIP: 3.10-4.20; follow-up: 1.52-3.60) and Orofacial Appearance (baseline OHIP: 0.44-2.50; follow-up: 0.91-2.25). Among studies reporting summary OHIP scores only (n = 15), overall OHRQoL impairment ranged from 1.40 to 42.35 at baseline and 1.50-40.56 at follow-up. All studies demonstrated a general trend of reduced OHRQoL impairment over time with treatment. Risk of bias was low, with no evidence of publication bias. Current evidence on OHRQoL impairment in DH and DT patient populations is limited, covering only a third of those treated by dental hygienists and therapists. Especially, scarce 4D OHRQoL data prompts the need for more research in this format. Despite these limitations, the findings show promising trends of reduced OHRQoL impairment over time for DH and DT patient populations."

Using keywords relevant to our research, such as \"Oral health related quality of life,\" \"Oral hygiene,\" \"Temporomandibular joint\" and \"Temporomandibular disorders,\" a comprehensive search across multiple online databases was carried out, yielding a total of 632 studies at the preliminary stage of the review. Modified New Castle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of studies included. Eight studies were included in the review, out of which six were eligible for further meta-analysis. The studies included in this review employed various OHRQoL measures, including the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the OHIP- 49. All the studies demonstrated significant effect of TMDs on the OHRQoL of the target population under study. The impact of OHRQoL on the management of TMD was deemed to be significant. The comprehensive management of TMD should consider the impact of the condition on the individual's daily life and incorporate interventions that address both the physical and psychological aspects of the condition. By improving OqL, individuals with TMD can experience improved overall well-being and quality of life."

Period poverty adversely affects the health of anyone capable of menstruating, which is nearly half of the world population, at the physiological, emotional, and psychosocial level. Biases, cultural beliefs, ethical reproductive justice issues, social stigma, and systemic factors contribute to period poverty. Every month, certain menstruators are disproportionately impacted by period poverty and struggle to access basic hygienic necessities. Important stakeholders include not only the individual who experiences menses but also educators and school systems, healthcare professionals, policymakers, public health officials, and researchers. Everyone has a role in addressing period poverty by voting for officials that proactively support legislation, policy, and programs at all levels to effectively advocate for menstrual equity and address barriers contributing to period poverty. This includes policies that increase access to menstrual hygiene products, safe menstrual management methods, and reproductive and women's health education. Programs globally that focus on capacity building and sustainability strategies can be used as models to reduce period poverty, thereby fostering a sense of empowerment and menstruators' sense of autonomy, dignity, and equality."

Due to inadequate infrastructure to provide education, healthcare, and communication as well as religious teachings, women and girls are excluded from participation in many activities of daily living and community activities during menstruation. Evidence based research addressing menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal is scares. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective. This systematic review identifies knowledge gaps and targets for future research and interventions. Studies from Nepal that examined factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were identified through searches across six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Nepal Journals Online and Kathmandu University Medical Journal) in January 2019. The SEM is a public health framework that describes how health is impacted at multiple levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Key themes were identified, and factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were categorized as per the level of socio-ecological model (SEM). After a comprehensive literature review, twenty peer-reviewed publications, published between 2003 and January 2019 were included in this review. Eighteen studies were descriptive and two were interventional. The main outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Nine studies focused on knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, seven studies highlighted reproductive health issues, three studies focused on prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, and one on school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene, inadequate WASH facilities, no sex education and culturally restrictive practices makes menstruation a challenge for Nepali women. These challenges have negative implications on women and girls' reproductive as well as mental health and school attendance among adolescent girls. There are gaps in the evidence for high quality interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address needs identified at all levels of the SEM. Menstrual health and hygiene are major public health and social issues in Nepal, due to a lack of health and education infrastructure, gender-based disparities and restrictive cultural and social norms. This study reviewed the current state of research on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. The socio-ecological model (SEM)—a public health framework that examines individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy impacts on health—was employed to describe impacts on menstrual health and hygiene. After a comprehensive literature review, 20 papers were included in this analysis, of which 18 were descriptive and two were interventional. The primary menstrual health and hygiene outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Key themes identified were knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, reproductive health issues, prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. The study results indicated lower menstrual health and hygiene challenges arose from lack of education around menstruation, lack of proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, poor sex education, and culturally restrictive practices. These challenges negatively impact women and girls’ reproductive health as well as mental health and school attendance. There is need for high quality, effective interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address improvements in menstrual health and hygiene at all levels of the socio-ecological model."

        "abstract": "As of 2020, about 21% of adults in the United States have a diagnosable mental health disorder, excluding substance use and developmental disorders. Depression, predicted by the WHO to be the leading cause of disease burden by 2030, is linked to various systemic conditions and has been associated with poor oral health. Both behavioral factors, like poor dental hygiene and irregular visits, and biological mechanisms, such as changes in salivary immunity, contribute to this connection, which impacts overall well-being and quality of life. This systematic review aims include: (1) Does tooth loss affect depression? (2) Does oral pain, such as that experienced during chewing and speaking, impact depression? (3) Does oral functionality, including chewing and speaking, influence depression? (4) Does overall oral health affect depression? We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EBSCO host, Medline, and Google Scholar databases from January 2000 to June 2024 using relevant keywords. Studies examining the impact of oral health parameters (tooth loss, oral pain, oral functionality, overall oral health) on depression were included. Articles were included if (1) full text manuscripts in English were available, (2) the study described the association of oral health and depression, and (3) the independent value was an oral related factor and the dependent value was depression. The following were excluded from our analysis: (1) any articles where oral factors were not the independent value, (2) systematic reviews, (3) case reports, and (4) duplicate studies among our databases. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Tooth loss, oral pain, and impaired oral functionality were consistently associated with increased depressive symptoms across the included studies. Greater tooth loss was linked to higher odds of both onset and progression of depression. Oral pain exacerbated depressive symptoms, while difficulties in chewing or speaking were associated with elevated risks of depression. There is a bidirectional relationship between oral health and depression, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive public health initiatives. Integrating oral health assessments into routine medical care, and developing targeted interventions are crucial steps to mitigate the impact of poor oral health on mental health outcomes."

This study aims to review the existing literature regarding key results of the PHSMs that were implemented, and to identify the PHSMs considered to have most impacted the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 over the last years during different stages of the pandemic. The PHSM under study were selected from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), supplemented by topics presented during the Rapid Exchange Forum (REF) meetings in the scope of the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) project (H2020). The evidence- based review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify which reviews have already been published about each PHSMs and their results. In addition, two modified Delphi panel surveys were conducted among subject matter experts from 30 European countries to uphold the results found. There were 3,212 studies retrieved from PubMed, 162 full texts assessed for eligibility and 35 included in this PHSMs summary. The measures with clearest evidence on their positive impact from the evidence-based review include social distancing, hygiene measures, mask measures and testing policies. From the modified Delphi panel, the PHSMs considered most significant in the four periods analyzed were case isolation at home, face coverings, testing policy, and social distancing, respectively. The evidence found has significant implications for both researchers and policymakers. The study of PHSMs' impact on COVID-19 illustrates lessons learned for future pan- and epidemics, serving as a contribution to the health systems resilience discussion. These lessons, drawn from both the available scientific evidence and the perspectives of relevant subject matter experts, should also be considered in educational and preparedness programs and activities in the public health space."

To review the highest level of available evidence, a systematic mapping review was conducted to identify systematic reviews that investigated the relationship between cyberbullying and mental and psychological outcomes in young people. Topic-relevant bibliographic databases and online resources were searched to identify reviews published since 2007. Data were extracted using a coding tool developed for this study. Methodological quality of included reviews was assessed using AMSTAR criteria. Nineteen systematic reviews satisfied the inclusion criteria and they reported a strong negative association between cyberbullying and mental health outcomes in young people. Meta-analysis was performed in 11 reviews and narrative synthesis in 8 reviews. Data were derived from predominantly cross-sectional studies and a clear causal relationship between cyberbullying and mental outcomes cannot be established. Two-third of the included reviews were classified to be of low or unclear quality, due to the lack of quality assessment of the primary studies included in individual reviews. This systematic map consolidates available evidence at review level and confirms the existing gaps in longitudinal and qualitative evidence synthesis. Closer examination of the moderating factors influencing cyberbullying behaviors in future research can advance our understanding and inform the development of tailored programs of intervention to mitigate the negative impact of this phenomenon."

Intelligent technologies for hand hygiene are increasingly being developed as alternative or supplemental monitoring approaches. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in the literature. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of using intelligent technology for hand hygiene in hospitals. We searched 7 databases from inception to December 31, 2022. Two reviewers independently and blindly selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted. Overall certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The systematic review protocol was registered. The 36 studies comprised 2 randomized controlled trials and 34 quasi-experimental studies. The included intelligent technologies involved 5 functions: performance reminders，electronic counting and remote monitoring，data processing，feedback，and education. Compared with usual care, the intelligent technology intervention for hand hygiene improved health care workers' hand hygiene compliance (risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.47-1.66; P<.001), reduced health care-associated infection rates (risk ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.33; P<.001), and was not associated with multidrug-resistant organism detection rates (risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04; P=.07). Three covariates, including publication year, study design, and intervention, were not factors of hand hygiene compliance or hospital-acquired infection rates analyzed by meta-regression. Sensitivity analysis showed stable results except for the pooled outcome of multidrug-resistant organism detection rates. The caliber of 3 pieces of evidence suggested a dearth of high-caliber research. Intelligent technologies for hand hygiene play an integral role in hospital. However, low quality of evidence and important heterogeneity were observed. Larger clinical trials are required to evaluate the impact of intelligent technology on multidrug-resistant organism detection rates and other clinical outcomes."

COVID-19 has led to closure and reduced hours of dental practices except for emergency and urgent services, limiting routine care and prevention. Dental care includes aerosol-generating procedures that can increase viral transmission. The pandemic offers an opportunity for the dental profession to shift more toward nonaerosolizing, prevention-centric approaches to care and away from surgical interventions. Regulatory barrier changes to oral health care access during the pandemic could have a favorable impact if sustained into the future."

In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in recruitment of health personnel who have been trained abroad, including from the poorest countries in the world. In this article, using General Medical Council (GMC) data, we chart the growth in numbers of international staff working in the United Kingdom, where since 2018, over half of all new GMC registrations have been of doctors trained abroad. There is evidence that this migration of health staff results in poorer health service provision in low and middle income countries, as well as substantial economic impacts in these countries that have invested in training their health workforce. Recruiting governments have argued that remittances compensate for the loss of personnel, and that training opportunities can enable skills transfer to countries with weaker health systems. However, we found that the costs to the source countries dwarfed remittances, and that only a tiny fraction of people who move to take up posts in wealthier countries ever return to their countries of origin to work. We conclude that in addition to the investment in health systems (and workforce development) in low and middle income countries as part of Official Development Assistance for Health, there is an urgent need to increase training of nurses and doctors so that damaging migration is no longer relied upon to fill gaps in healthcare personnel."

To prepare for future crises and to preserve public health, we conduct an overview of systematic reviews to examine the evidence on the effect of the Great Recession on population health. We searched PubMed and Scopus for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses focusing specifically on the impact of the Great Recession on population health (eg, mental health). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed throughout this review and critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was performed using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. Twenty-one studies were identified and consistently showed that the Great Recession was most risky to health, the more a country's economy was affected and the longer strict austerity policies were in place. Consequently, a deterioration of health was highest in countries that had implemented strict austerity measures (eg, Greece), but not in countries that rejected austerity measures (eg, Germany). Moreover, the impact of the Great Recession fell disproportionately on the most vulnerable groups such as people in unemployment, at risk of unemployment and those living in poverty. The experiences of the last economic crisis show that it is possible to limit the consequences for health. Prioritising mental healthcare and prevention, foregoing austerity measures in the healthcare system and protecting vulnerable groups are the most important lessons learnt. Moreover, given the further aggravating social inequalities, a health in all policies approach, based on a comprehensive Health Impact Assessment, is advised."

All included publications presented data on clinical and/or subjective oral health outcomes in care home residents in Europe with no restrictions for language or study design. MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched, including publications from January 2010 onward. Data extraction and quality assessment (Qualsyst tool) was performed by 2 researchers independently. Findings were synthesized narratively, lack in data homogeneity restricted the relevance of a meta-analysis. Eighty-three papers from 18 countries were included in the systematic review, with a sample size ranging from 39 to 92,827 participants. Their mean age was older than 80 years. The residents had few natural teeth, with fewer than a third a functional natural dentition. Removable dentures were present in half to 80% of residents. A high prevalence of dental caries was reported. Oral hygiene was insufficient, for both natural teeth and removable dentures. Few residents had a healthy periodontium. Clinical treatment needs were found in most residents. Perceived treatment needs were high with at least one-third of care home residents reporting a need for care due to poor oral health. A fifth to half of the residents reported negative impacts of their oral condition on their everyday lives. This systematic review clearly highlights the poor oral health and high burden of oral conditions among care home residents across Europe, irrespective of country or health care system. There is need for substantial policy actions to improve oral health in care homes."

Despite technological advancements, many interventions aimed at improving WASH access return less than optimal results on long term impact, efficacy and sustainability. Research focus in the 'WASH sector' has recently expanded from investigating 'which interventions work' to 'how they are best implemented'. The 'acceptability' of an intervention is a key component of implementation that can influence initial uptake and sustained use. Acceptability assessments are increasingly common for health interventions in clinical settings. A broad scale assessment of how acceptability has been measured in the WASH sector, however, has not yet been conducted. We conducted a systematic literature review of intervention studies published between 1990 and 2021 that evaluated the acceptability of WASH interventions in LMIC settings. Using an implementation science approach, focused outcomes included how acceptability was measured and defined, and the timing of acceptability assessment. We conducted quality assessment for all included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised studies, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised studies. Of the 1238 records; 36 studies were included for the analysis, 22 of which were non-randomized interventions and 16 randomized or cluster-randomized trials. We found that among the 36 studies, four explicitly defined their acceptability measure, and six used a behavioural framework to inform their acceptability study design. There were few acceptability evaluations in schools and healthcare facilities. While all studies reported measuring WASH acceptability, the measures were often not comparable or described. As focus in WASH research shifts towards implementation, a consistent approach to including, defining, and measuring acceptability is needed."

Multiple sclerosis can cause disturbances in the orofacial district, due to a demyelination process on the nerves of the head and neck district. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral health status, dysphagia, and quality of life of patients affected by MS. For this study, 101 patients aged between 12 and 70 (47 males, 54 females) affected by MS were selected, and three questionnaires were handed out and anonymously filled in by them: An oral hygiene test, DYMUS (DYsphagia in MUltiple Sclerosis), and IOHIP-14 (Italian version Oral Health Impact Profile). Through the analysis of the questionnaires it was possible to observe pathological conditions, such as gingival inflammation, xerostomia, dysphagia, neuralgia, and dysarthria. Through the analysis it was possible to outline how the roles of a medical team, composed of a dentist, otolaryngologist, and dental hygienist, are fundamental in coping with other medical figures, during the whole development of the diseases, as well as to prevent possible complications."

The evidence-based librarianship (EBL) checklist assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Data were extracted using a pre-designed extraction tool, and a narrative analysis was undertaken. Following the search, 71 records were returned, with seven satisfying the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted between 2003 and 2015, and 57% (n = 4) of these employed a pre-post study design. The mean sample size was 155 participants (SD = ±117.6). All the included studies (100%, n = 8) identified that there was a direct relationship between the use of skincare bundles and the reduction in the incidence of skin tears in the elderly. The EBL scores varied between 65% and 91%. In total, 85.7% (n = 6) of the studies scored ≥75%, reflecting validity. This systematic review highlights the connection between skincare bundles and the reduction of the number of skin tears in the older population (≥65 years). Further research with larger sample sizes and longer study duration to validate these findings, which will provide a comprehensive insight into the prevention of the incidence of skin tears. Further studies are justified given that skin tear bundles can reduce the rate of injuries that are easily acquired by the elderly due to the nature of their frail skin, they also can help prevent skin tears from turning into chronic wounds and can decrease hospital admissions associated with hospital-acquired infections."

To promote good hand hygiene practices, the World Health Organization introduced May 5 as World Hand Hygiene Day (WHHD), and international stakeholders established Global Handwashing Day (GHD) on October 15. However, its contributions to raising public awareness of hand hygiene is unclear. This study evaluates the impact of the WHHD and GHD on the public awareness of hand hygiene in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and worldwide from 2016 to 2020, using the relative search volume of \"Hand hygiene\" in Google Trends as a surrogate. To identify a statistically significant timepoint of a trend change, we performed Joinpoint regression analysis. Upticks of the relative search volumes as well as joinpoints were noted worldwide around the WHHD and GHD from 2016 to 2019, but no joinpoints were identified around the WHHD and GHD in 2020. No such changes were observed in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States during these periods. While the WHHD was originally established to raise awareness of hand hygiene in healthcare facilities, our result suggests that the WHHD and GHD may not have effectively disseminated the importance of hand hygiene to the general public at a country level. Additional policy measures to advocate hand hygiene to the public are necessary to communicate its benefits."

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hand hygiene performance (HHP) rates in acute care hospitals. HHP rates were estimated using an automated hand hygiene monitoring system installed in 74 adult inpatient units in 7 hospitals and 10 pediatric inpatient units in 2 children's hospitals. A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the 10 weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for 10 weeks after. Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at P < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for 4 weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period. Data from an automated hand hygiene monitoring system indicated that HHP shifted in multiple directions during the early stages of the pandemic. We discuss possible reasons why HHP first increased as the pandemic began and then decreased as it progressed."

Progress has been made across multiple priority areas identified on the National Dental Hygiene Research Agenda, including educational research examining the impact of curriculum models on teaching and learning; health services research projects documenting workforce issues and cost-effectiveness of practice models; and public health initiatives expanding access to care to provide oral health care services for diverse patient populations. The Journal of Dental Hygiene, established in 1927, has played a significant role in disseminating scientific evidence to the global dental hygiene and professional communities. Collaborative efforts both within dental hygiene and externally with interprofessional partners and key stakeholders have positively contributed towards building the research infrastructure to support the profession. The number of dental hygienists who are actively engaged in research has increased, as has the value for research as part of the research culture. Focused research priorities and training efforts have encouraged collaborations across the globe to conduct and promote the science supporting dental hygiene education and practice. Development, testing and validation of theoretical frameworks is essential to drive all professional activities. Building a community of scholars who will continue to define the dental hygiene discipline through scholarship is critical to promote a scholarly identity for the profession."

By tracing the origins of this concept over 2 centuries of interactions between market forces and public health action and research, we propose an expanded framework and definition of CDoH. This conceptualization enables public health professionals and researchers to more fully realize the potential of the CDoH concept to yield insights that can be used to improve global and national health and reduce the stark health inequities within and between nations. It also widens the utility of CDoH from its main current use to study noncommunicable diseases to other health conditions such as infectious diseases, mental health conditions, injuries, and exposure to environmental threats. We suggest specific actions that public health professionals can take to transform the burgeoning interest in CDoH into meaningful improvements in health. ("

Given the limited impact of current interventions for stunting, new multisectoral evidence-based approaches are needed to decrease the burden of stunting in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recognizing that the health of people, animals, and the environment are connected, we present the rationale and research agenda for considering a One Health approach to child stunting. We contend that a One Health strategy may uncover new approaches to tackling child stunting by addressing several interdependent factors that prevent children from thriving in LMICs, and that coordinated interventions among human health, animal health, and environmental health sectors may have a synergistic effect in stunting reduction."

        "abstract": "Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services play a crucial role in promoting public and environmental health as well as social and economic development. At the global level, particularly in the developing world, WASH issues continue to present significant challenges. These challenges have been further intensified by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, climate change, water scarcity, and rising inequality. The scientific community has actively engaged in constructive discussions on these issues, as evidenced by the notable research findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to comprehensively examine and evaluate global knowledge on WASH. To search for relevant publications, the Scopus database was utilized using specific terms associated with WASH. VOSviewer 1.6.18 software was employed to generate network visualization maps, which assessed collaborative patterns and research trends in the field of WASH. The research output of countries was adjusted considering their gross domestic product (GDP) and population size. The total number of WASH-related publications, including all types of documents, was 1805. By narrowing the search to articles and reviews, the overall global productivity yielded 1589 documents: 1367 (86.0%) original articles and 222 (14.0%) review articles. The USA had the highest number of WASH publications (n = 668; 42.0%), followed by the UK (n = 396; 24.9%), Switzerland (n = 151; 9.5%), and Australia (n = 141; 8.9%). Ethiopia emerged as the leading country in terms of GDP per capita and the number of publications, followed by Uganda, Malawi, India, and Bangladesh. The USA, the UK, and Switzerland exhibited the most extensive collaboration among countries. The main research areas encompassed the role of WASH in sustainable development, the impacts of inadequate access to WASH services on gender equality, children, infants, and the outbreak of COVID-19 and other diseases, as well as the significance of hygiene practices and community and school-based WASH interventions in reducing infections. This study provides a novel analysis of global WASH-related research and highlights the distribution of outcomes across nations. Continued and increased collaboration between developed and developing nations will facilitate the sharing of responsibility for WASH research outcomes and the implementation of effective policies."

        "abstract": "Both malnutrition and poor mental health are leading sources of global mortality, disease, and disability. The fields of global food security and nutrition (FSN) and mental health have historically been seen as separate fields of research. Each have undergone substantial transformation, especially from clinical, primary care orientations to wider, sociopolitical approaches to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. In recent years, the trajectories of research on mental health and FSN are further evolving into an intersection of evidence. FSN impacts mental health through various pathways such as food insecurity and nutrients important for neurotransmission. Mental health drives FSN outcomes, for example through loss of motivation and caregiving capacities. They are also linked through a complex and interrelated set of determinants. However, the heterogeneity of the evidence base limits inferences about these important dynamics. Furthermore, interdisciplinary projects and programmes are gaining ground in methodology and impact, but further guidance in integration is much needed. An evidence-driven conceptual framework should inform hypothesis testing and programme implementation. The intersection of mental health and FSN can be an opportunity to invest holistically in advancing thinking in both fields."

This study aims to assess the response and impact of COVID-19 on chiropractors internationally, and examines the public health response of chiropractors to the COVID-19 pandemic practising under a musculoskeletal spine-care versus subluxation-based care paradigm. A survey was distributed to chiropractors in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and United States (Oct. 2nd-Dec. 22nd, 2020) via professional bodies/publications, and social media. Questions were categorised into three domains: socio-demographic, public health response and business/financial impact. Multivariable logistic regression explored survey items associated with chiropractors practising under different self-reported paradigms. A total of 2061 chiropractors representing four global regions completed the survey. Our recruitment method did not allow the calculation of an accurate response rate. The vast majority initiated COVID-19 infection control changes within their practice setting, including increased disinfecting of treatment equipment (95%), frequent contact areas (94%) and increased hand hygiene (94%). While findings varied by region, most chiropractors (85%) indicated that they had implemented regulator advice on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Suspension of face-to-face patient care during the peak of the pandemic was reported by 49% of the participants with 26% implementing telehealth since the pandemic began. Chiropractors practising under a musculoskeletal spine-care paradigm were more likely to implement some/all regulator advice on patient PPE use (odds ratio [OR] = 3.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57, 6.74) and practitioner PPE use (OR = 2.59; 95% CI 1.32, 5.08); trust COVID-19 public health information provided by government/World Health Organisation/chiropractic bodies (OR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.49, 4.10), and initiate patient telehealth in response to COVID-19 (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.02, 2.08) compared to those practising under a subluxation-based paradigm. Chiropractors who responded to our survey made substantial infectious control changes in response to COVID-19. However, there was regional variation in the implementation of the advised practitioner and patient use of PPE and limited overall use of telehealth consultations by chiropractors during COVID-19. Musculoskeletal spine-care chiropractors were more adaptive to certain COVID-19 public health changes within their practice setting than subluxation-based chiropractors."

While this has been explored in terms of the effect on dental practice, the dental implications for patients and for population oral health have not received sufficient attention. This opinion piece discusses how: i) financial pressures leading to hygiene poverty may limit the ability to afford the basic products necessary to maintain oral hygiene; ii) food insecurity is associated with a diet high in sugar and lacking in appropriate nutrition; and iii) reduced disposable income may limit the ability to attend and successfully engage with dental care. The impact of the cost-of-living crisis on the lowest paid members of the dental team is also considered.The most common dental diseases are closely correlated with social and economic deprivation and the points discussed here act as a reminder of how the present financial circumstances have significant potential to widen oral health inequalities."

This includes the Covid-19 pandemic as well as more protracted crises such as climate change and persistent social inequalities that impact health. We sought to understand and compare how knowledge exchange (KE) processes occur across different crises, and how knowledge on improving social determinants of health can be utilised at times of crisis to reduce health inequalities and strengthen public systems. We conducted a scoping review to understand how KE on improving social determinants of health can occur across different types of crises (e.g. environmental, pandemics, humanitarian). Relevant studies were identified through electronic searching of Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus and Web of Science databases. We identified 86 studies for inclusion in the review. Most studies concerned pandemic or environmental crises. Fewer studies explored KE during technical (e.g. nuclear), terror-related or humanitarian crises. This may reflect a limitation of the searches. Few studies assessed KE as part of longer-term responses to social and economic impacts of crises, with studies more likely to focus on immediate response or early recovery stages. Exchange of research evidence or data with policy or practice contextual knowledge was common but there was variation in the extent that lay (public) knowledge was included as part of KE processes. As ongoing crises continue with significant public health implications, KE processes should appropriately reflect the complexity inherent in crises and foreground health inequalities. Doing so could include the utilisation of systems or complexity-informed methods to support planning and evaluation of KE, a greater focus on KE to support action to address social determinants of health, and the inclusion of a plurality of knowledge-including lived experience-in planning and responding to crises."

We conducted a scoping review on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls' access to and utilisation of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for contraception, abortion, gender-based and intimate partner violence (GBV/IPV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We systematically searched peer reviewed literature and quantitative reports, published between December 2019 and July 2021, focused on women and girls' (15-49 years old) access to and utilisation of selected SRH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Included studies were grouped based on setting, SRH service area, study design, population and reported impact. Qualitative data were coded, organised thematically and grouped by major findings. We included 83 of 3067 identified studies and found that access to contraception, in-person safe abortion services, in-person services for GBV/IPV and STI/HIV testing, prevention and treatment decreased. The geographical distribution of this body of research was uneven and significantly less representative of countries where COVID-19 restrictions were very strict. Access was limited by demand and supply side barriers including transportation disruptions, financial hardships, limited resources and legal restrictions. Few studies focused on marginalised groups with distinct SRH needs. Reports indicated negative impacts on access to and utilisation of SRH services globally, especially for marginalised populations during the pandemic. Our findings call for strengthening of health systems preparedness and resilience to safeguard global access to essential SRH services in ongoing and future emergencies."

The theoretical debate about what public hygiene used to be shows its eminently political side: not only was hygiene a branch of the political economy, the ideas of hygienists were also analyzed as to the degree of impact they had on policy. After political and scientific battles, certain understandings of government action emerged victorious, while others were forgotten and neglected."

We conducted a review of the literature that provided quantitative or qualitative evidence of CHC interventions focused on WASH in low- and middle-income countries. We identified 25 articles that met our inclusion criteria. We found six major outcomes: WASH behaviors and knowledge, social capital, collective action, health, and cost or cost-effectiveness. The most consistent evidence was associated with WASH behaviors and knowledge, with significant effects on defecation practices, hand washing behaviors, and WASH knowledge. We also found qualitative evidence of impact on social capital and collective action. CHCs catalyze favorable changes in WASH behaviors and knowledge, yielding outcomes commensurate with other WASH promotion strategies. This review provides insights into the model's theory of change, helping identify areas for further investigation. The CHC model's holistic focus and emphasis on individual and collective change offer promising potential to address multiple health and development determinants."

This systematic review was meticulously carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar including studies from January 2000 to December 2022. Studies that examined the influence of urban green spaces on heat-related morbidity and mortality, including randomised controlled trials, observational and modelling studies, were included. A total of 3301 publications were initially identified, out of which 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. The selected studies were predominantly from high-income and upper-middle-income nations (95%). The research points towards a pattern where regions abundant in green spaces report lower rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality in contrast to those with sparse greenery. Additionally, urban vegetation appears to exert a positive influence on mental health and well-being, potentially aiding in offsetting the adverse health repercussions of high temperatures. Urban green spaces play a vital role in mitigating heat-related health risks, offering a potential strategy for urban planning to address climate change and enhance public health. Additional research is required to thoroughly comprehend the magnitude of urban greenery's impact on heat-related morbidity and mortality, as well as its interplay with other variables, including air pollution, socioeconomic status, among others."

We reviewed recent empirical evidence on factors related to oral health in older immigrants. In a systematic search across multiple databases, we identified 12 eligible studies in this review. Among the eligible studies, most were conducted among East Asian immigrants (8 articles), followed by non-Hispanic White/European origin (2 articles), Mexican origins (1 article), and Iran and other Middle East regions (1 article). The research revealed knowledge gaps in the evidence base, including the dynamic relationship between acculturation and oral health, the role of environmental factors on oral health for immigrants, psychosocial stressors and their relationship with oral health, and oral health literacy, norms, and attitude to dental care utilization and oral hygiene practices. The development of the integrative framework suggests the pathways/mechanisms through which immigration exerts influences on oral health in later life. This provides opportunities for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to gain greater insights into the complex associations between immigration and oral health among older adults."

        "abstract": "The In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts—both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world’s populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people’s lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating. The 2022 Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine—rather than protect—the future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding people’s health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all."

        "abstract": "A fast emerging area of public health interest is the potential role of social media influencers in spreading health information and affecting health behaviour. The aim of this research was to systematically synthesise evidence on the impact of social media influencers on health outcomes. A systematic search of six databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Science Citation Index and Sociology Collection) was conducted in October 2021, with an update search in January 2023. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. We included interventional study designs which examined the effect of social media influencer as the primary or only exposure on a quantified health outcome. We used narrative synthesis to summarise the characteristics and main findings of studies within each of four main topic areas. We assessed quality using a critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies. We identified twelve studies across four areas that met the inclusion criteria: children's dietary behaviour (n = 5), body image dissatisfaction (n = 4), influenza and COVID-19 (n = 2), and social comparison and anxiety (n = 1). Influencer marketing of unhealthy foods had a statistically significant effect on increasing children's immediate energy intake, but no effect was found for influencer promotion of vegetables. When an unhealthy food is marketed by an influencer of unhealthy appearance, this led to an increased preference for healthy snacks. Exposure to idealised influencer body imagery had statistically significant negative impacts on body image and mood. Anxiety caused by viewing idealised portrayals of motherhood was the same whether or not the portrayal was by an influencer. Public health campaigns harnessing influencers to promote hygiene habits in the context of COVID-19 and influenza showed some positive changes in health behaviours. Most of the published studies are of poor methodological quality with poor generalisability and statistical weaknesses. We conclude that social media influencers have both negative and positive impacts on health outcomes, with negative impacts seen consistently in studies of body image dissatisfaction. Further research is needed to harness the potential positive health impact of social media influencers, while mitigating against harmful effects."

        "abstract": "The The world has observed a 1°C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, with feedback cycles and polar amplification resulting in a rise as high as 3°C in north western Canada. The Paris Agreement has set a target of “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1·5°C.” In a world that matches this ambition, a child born today would see the phase-out of all coal in the UK and Canada by their sixth and 11th birthday; they would see France ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by their 21st birthday; and they would be 31 years old by the time the world reaches net-zero in 2050, with the UK’s recent commitment to reach this goal one of many to come. The changes seen in this alternate pathway could result in cleaner air, safer cities, and more nutritious food, coupled with renewed investment in health systems and vital infrastructure. This second path—which limits the global average temperature rise to “well below 2°C”—is possible, and would transform the health of a child born today for the better, right the way through their life. Considering the evidence available in the 2019 indicators, such a transition could be beginning to unfold. Despite a small increase in coal use in 2018, in key countries such as China, it continued to decrease as a share of electricity generation (indicator 3.1.2). Correspondingly, renewables accounted for 45% of global growth in power generation capacity that year, and low-carbon electricity reached a high of 32% of global electricity in 2016 (indicator 3.1.3). Global per capita use of electric vehicles increased by 20·6% between 2015 and 2016, and now represents 1·8% of China’s total transportation fuel use (indicator 3.4). Improvements in air pollution seen in Europe from 2015 to 2016, could result in a reduction of Years of Life Lost (YLL) worth €5·2 billion annually, if this reduction remained constant across a lifetime (indicator 4.2). In several cases, the economic savings from a healthier and more productive workforce, with fewer health-care expenses, will cover the initial investment costs of these interventions. Similarly, cities and health systems are becoming more resilient to the effects of climate change; about 50% of countries and 69% of cities surveyed reported efforts to conduct national health adaptation plans or climate change risk assessments (indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3). These plans are now being implemented, with the number of countries providing climate services to the health sector increasing from 55 in 2018 to 70 in 2019 (indicator 2.2) and 109 countries reporting medium to high implementation of a national health emergency framework (indicator 2.3.1). Growing demand is coupled with a steady increase in health adaptation spending, which represents 5% (£13 billion) of total adaptation funding in 2018 and has increased by 11·8% over the past 12 months (indicator 2.4). This increase is in part funded by growing revenues from carbon pricing mechanisms, with a 30% increase to US$43 billion in funds raised between 2017 and 2018 (indicator 4.4.3). However, current progress is inadequate, and despite the beginnings of the transition described, the indicators published in the"

        "abstract": "The Record temperatures in 2020 resulted in a new high of 3·1 billion more person-days of heatwave exposure among people older than 65 years and 626 million more person-days affecting children younger than 1 year, compared with the annual average for the 1986–2005 baseline (indicator 1.1.2). Looking to 2021, people older than 65 years or younger than 1 year, along with people facing social disadvantages, were the most affected by the record-breaking temperatures of over 40°C in the Pacific Northwest areas of the USA and Canada in June, 2021—an event that would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change. Although the exact number will not be known for several months, hundreds of people have died prematurely from the heat. Furthermore, populations in countries with low and medium levels of UN-defined human development index (HDI) have had the biggest increase in heat vulnerability during the past 30 years, with risks to their health further exacerbated by the low availability of cooling mechanisms and urban green space (indicators 1.1.1, 2.3.2, and 2.3.3). Agricultural workers in countries with low and medium HDI were among the worst affected by exposure to extreme temperatures, bearing almost half of the 295 billion potential work hours lost due to heat in 2020 (indicator 1.1.4). These lost work hours could have devastating economic consequences to these already vulnerable workers—data in this year’s report shows that the average potential earnings lost in countries in the low HDI group were equivalent to 4–8% of the national gross domestic product (indicator 4.1.3). Through these effects, rising average temperatures, and altered rainfall patterns, climate change is beginning to reverse years of progress in tackling the food and water insecurity that still affects the most underserved populations around the world, denying them an essential aspect of good health. During any given month in 2020, up to 19% of the global land surface was affected by extreme drought; a value that had not exceeded 13% between 1950 and 1999 (indicator 1.2.2). In parallel with drought, warm temperatures are affecting the yield potential of the world’s major staple crops—a 6·0% reduction for maize; 3·0% for winter wheat; 5·4% for soybean; and 1·8% for rice in 2020, relative to 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4.1)—exposing the rising risk of food insecurity. Adding to these health hazards, the changing environmental conditions are also increasing the suitability for the transmission of many water-borne, air-borne, food-borne, and vector-borne pathogens. Although socioeconomic development, public health interventions, and advances in medicine have reduced the global burden of infectious disease transmission, climate change could undermine eradication efforts. The number of months with environmentally suitable conditions for the transmission of malaria ( 10 months into 2021, global and equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine had not been delivered—more than 60% of people in high-income countries have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with just 3·5% of people in low-income countries. Data in this report exposes similar inequities in the global climate change mitigation response. To meet the Paris Agreement goals and prevent catastrophic levels of global warming, global greenhouse gas emissions must reduce by half within a decade. However, at the current pace of reduction, it would take more than 150 years for the energy system to fully decarbonise (indicator 3.1), and the unequal response between countries is resulting in an uneven realisation of the health benefits of a low-carbon transition. The use of public funds to subsidise fossil fuels is partly responsible for the slow decarbonisation rate. Of the 84 countries reviewed, 65 were still providing an overall subsidy to fossil fuels in 2018 and, in many cases, subsidies were equivalent to substantial proportions of the national health budget and could have been redirected to deliver net benefits to health and wellbeing. Furthermore, all the 19 countries whose carbon pricing policies outweighed the effect of any fossil fuels subsidies came from the very high HDI group (indicator 4.2.4). Although countries in the very high HDI group have collectively made the most progress in the decarbonisation of the energy system, they are still the main contributors to CO The overshoot in emissions resulting from a carbon-intensive COVID-19 recovery would irreversibly prevent the world from meeting climate commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals and lock humanity into an increasingly extreme and unpredictable environment. Data in this report expose the health impacts and health inequities of the current world at 1·2°C of warming above pre-industrial levels and supports that, on the current trajectory, climate change will become the defining narrative of human health. However, by directing the trillions of dollars that will be committed to COVID-19 recovery towards the WHO’s prescriptions for a healthy, green recovery, the world could meet the Paris Agreement goals, protect the natural systems that support wellbeing, and minimise inequities through reduced health effects and maximised co-benefits of a universal low-carbon transition. Promoting equitable climate change mitigation and universal access to clean energies could prevent millions of deaths annually from reduced exposure to air pollution, healthier diets, and more active lifestyles, and contribute to reducing health inequities globally. This pivotal moment of economic stimulus represents a historical opportunity to secure the health of present and future generations. There is a glimpse of positive change through several promising trends in this year’s data: electricity generation from renewable wind and solar energy increased by an annual average of 17% between 2013 and 2018 (indicator 3.1); investment in new coal capacity decreased by 10% in 2020 (indicator 4.2.1); and the global number of electric vehicles reached 7·2 million in 2019 (indicator 3.4). Additionally, the global pandemic has driven increased engagement in health and climate change across multiple domains in society, with 91 heads of state making the connection in the 2020 UN General Debate and newly widespread engagement among countries in the very high HDI group (indicator 5.4). Whether COVID-19 recovery supports, or reverses these trends, is yet to be seen. Neither COVID-19 nor climate change respect national borders. Without widespread, accessible vaccination across all countries and societies, SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants will continue to put the health of everybody at risk. Likewise, tackling climate change requires all countries to deliver an urgent and coordinated response, with COVID-19 recovery funds allocated to support and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon future and climate change adaptation across the globe. Leaders of the world have an unprecedented opportunity to deliver a future of improved health, reduced inequity, and economic and environmental sustainability. However, this will only be possible if the world acts together to ensure that no person is left behind."

        "abstract": "Frequent consumption of sports and energy drinks among athletes is of concern due to its detrimental impact on oral health. The present study aimed to assess sports and energy drink consumption, oral health status and impacts on daily activities and sports performance among elite athletes from Pakistan. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics, sports and energy drink consumption, oral health and hygiene practices, self-reported oral health and psychosocial and performance impact was assessed using a self-administered, structured questionnaire followed by clinical oral examination by a single, experienced dentist. A total of 104 athletes, a majority of whom were male (80.8%), participated in the study. Around two third of the participants reported consumption of sports and energy drinks, energy gels or bars at least once a week, the commonest being Sting. Despite good oral hygiene practices, the athletes generally had poor oral health with high prevalence of dental caries (63.5%), gingivitis (46.1%), irreversible periodontitis (26.9%) and erosive tooth wear (21.2%). More than a quarter (28.8%) of the athletes rated their oral health as fair-very poor. Four in five athletes (80%) also experienced at least one oral problem with negative impacts on daily activities (64.4%) and participation training and sports performance (36.5%). Regression analyses revealed a significant association between periodontal disease and impact on both daily activities and sports performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that high-prevalence sports and energy drink consumption and oral problems among elite athletes from Pakistan has a negative impact on daily activities and sports performance. These findings may have important implications for oral health education programs, and the need to create awareness among the athletes regarding the use of sports and energy drinks, as well as regular oral health screening of athletes to minimize the impact on performance."

        "abstract": "Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations."

        "abstract": "Poor oral health due to dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases worldwide. It has a significant impact on individuals across the lifespan and is a leading cause of preventable hospitalizations. The impacts of COVID-19 on oral health at the practice level are well documented, but gaps in understanding the impact on individual oral health remain. This review addresses this gap. Using a JBI scoping review process we mapped and summarized the evidence to identify the impact of COVID-19 on individual oral health. Key search terms were developed, and searches were undertaken by an experienced research librarian. The 85 included studies were conducted in 23 countries from 5 regions across the world classified using the United Nations Geoscheme system. The majority (82/85) were quantitative, 2 were reviews and there was one qualitative interview study. Cross-sectional surveys were the most common data collection approach followed by an analysis of clinical data, analysis of internet trends and other online methods. Five key areas were identified including changes to the provision of emergency dental services, provision of routine oral health services, oral hygiene maintenance at home, changes in dietary preferences, alternative models of dental provision and help-seeking and attitudes towards dental care in the future. This scoping review has demonstrated that the pandemic has impacted on oral health at the individual level. It is important that we are aware of these impacts and ensure that support systems are in place to overcome future periods where access to dental care might be compromised. The provision of preventive care remains a vital first step in ensuring good overall oral health as is paramount during periods where access to dental treatment might be limited."

        "abstract": "Sleep deprivation is known to affect multiple aspects of mental health, physical health, and daily functioning. With increasing reports of sleep disturbances and increasing mental health needs in adolescents, it is imperative that healthcare providers have a strong understanding of the relationship between sleep and mental health, the impact of poor sleep on the school experience, and an understanding of behavioral interventions targeting sleep practices. Recent studies have shown that the relationship between sleep and mental health is complex and multifaceted. While mental health diagnoses and symptoms can negatively influence sleep quality and quantity, so too does poor sleep increase the risk of mental health diagnoses, symptom severity, and suicide risk. Sleep likewise affects the school experience, both positively and negatively. Targeted interventions and prevention programs may be effective in treatment of sleep disturbances for adolescents. Clinicians must be aware of the above associations and their clinical implications. Patients with either mental health or sleep concerns should be screened for potential co-morbid conditions. Improving sleep hygiene practices can improve the sleep experience in adolescents, however, there remains a gap in understanding the best method to improve sleep hygiene practices in this population."

        "abstract": "In 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. The manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly age-dependent and potentially more severe in cases with involved co-morbidities. The gravity of the symptoms depends on the clinical stage of the infection. The most common symptoms include runny nose and nasal congestion, anosmia, dysgeusia or hypogeusia, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, respiratory distress, fatigue, ocular symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These systemic conditions are often accompanied by skin and mucosal lesions. Oral lesions reported in patients with COVID-19 include: herpex simplex, candidiasis, geographic tongue, aphthous-like ulcers, hemorrhagic ulcerations, necrotic ulcerations, white hairy tongue, reddish macules, erythematous surfaces, petechiae, and pustular enanthema. It is still unclear if these manifestations are a direct result of the viral infection, a consequence of systemic deterioration, or adverse reactions to treatments. Poor oral hygiene in hospitalized or quarantined COVID-19 patients should also be considered as an aggravating condition. This narrative review is focused on presenting the most relevant data from the literature regarding oral manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the challenges faced by the dental system during this pandemic. A routine intraoral examination is recommended in COVID-19 patients, either suspected or confirmed, as, in certain cases, oral manifestations represent a sign of severe infection or even of a life-threatening condition. It is our belief that extensive knowledge of all possible manifestations, including oral lesions, in cases of COVID-19 is of great importance in the present uncertain context, including new, currently emerging viral variants with unknown future impact."

        "abstract": "While employment programs were not created with the intent to improve common mental disorders (CMDs), they may have a positive impact on the prevalence, incidence, and severity of CMD by reducing poverty and increasing access to economic mobility. To examine and synthesize the available quantitative evidence of the impact of employment programs on outcomes of CMD. Embase, Econlit, Global Health, MEDLINE, APA PsychINFO, and Social Policy and Practice were searched for experimental and quasi-experimental studies which investigated the impact of employment programs on primary and secondary outcomes of a CMD. A narrative synthesis according to Popay was conducted. The methodological quality of studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale. Of the 1,327 studies retrieved, two randomized controlled trials, one retrospective cohort, one pilot study with a non-randomized experimental design, and one randomized field experiment were included in the final review. Employment programs generally included multiple components such as skills-based training, and hands-on placements. Depression and anxiety were the CMDs measured as primary or secondary outcomes within included studies. Findings regarding the impact of employment programs on CMD were mixed with two studies reporting significantly positive effects, two reporting no effects, and one reporting mixed effects. The quality among included studies was good overall with some concerns regarding internal validity. Employment programs may support a decrease in the prevalence, incidence, and severity of CMDs. However, there is high heterogeneity among study effects, designs, and contexts. More research is needed to gain further insight into the nature of this association and the mechanisms of impact. This review highlights the potential for employment programs and other poverty-reduction interventions to be utilized and integrated into the wider care, prevention, and treatment of common-mental disorders."

Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality not only affects physical health but may also affect oral health. This scoping review aims to collate existing evidence related to the impact of sleep duration and/or quality on oral health. A systematic search strategy using PubMed, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL databases was performed to identify studies that assessed the association between sleep quality or duration and oral health or hygiene. Two researchers independently screened and extracted the data. Eligible studies were critically appraised using the NIH quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies checklist. The search identified 18,398 studies, from which 14 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the 14 papers, four papers were associated with effect of sleep on caries, 8 papers described the effect of sleep on gingival and periodontal health, and two papers described the effect of sleep on general oral health and oral disease symptoms. This review found a direct link between sleep and dental decay in children, and short sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of periodontitis adults."

        "abstract": "Dental caries generates significant health, financial and social costs to individuals and communities, but risk factors are not spread randomly and evenly throughout populations. People from lower socio-economic status (SES) and disadvantaged groups suffer a disproportionately greater disease burden. Clinicians and public health experts view this problem through a different lens. Dentists at the clinical coalface consider individual risk factors and behaviours, for example sugar consumption, cariogenic bacteria and poor oral hygiene, as major causes of dental caries. However, considerable evidence suggests that low SES, via traditional individual risk factors as mediators and through additional independent pathways, is another significant cause. Progressive clinical practice uses education, prevention and treatment to reduce the impact of individual risk factors. Policy-makers and health administrators use population-based approaches to improve the health of societies. The authors use literature review to argue for both a greater awareness of the upstream socio-economic causes of dental caries, and action from key community sectors to redress the societal inequalities contributing to dental health inequalities."

Due to inadequate infrastructure to provide education, healthcare, and communication as well as religious teachings, women and girls are excluded from participation in many activities of daily living and community activities during menstruation. Evidence based research addressing menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal is scares. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective. This systematic review identifies knowledge gaps and targets for future research and interventions. Studies from Nepal that examined factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were identified through searches across six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Nepal Journals Online and Kathmandu University Medical Journal) in January 2019. The SEM is a public health framework that describes how health is impacted at multiple levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Key themes were identified, and factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were categorized as per the level of socio-ecological model (SEM). After a comprehensive literature review, twenty peer-reviewed publications, published between 2003 and January 2019 were included in this review. Eighteen studies were descriptive and two were interventional. The main outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Nine studies focused on knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, seven studies highlighted reproductive health issues, three studies focused on prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, and one on school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene, inadequate WASH facilities, no sex education and culturally restrictive practices makes menstruation a challenge for Nepali women. These challenges have negative implications on women and girls' reproductive as well as mental health and school attendance among adolescent girls. There are gaps in the evidence for high quality interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address needs identified at all levels of the SEM. Menstrual health and hygiene are major public health and social issues in Nepal, due to a lack of health and education infrastructure, gender-based disparities and restrictive cultural and social norms. This study reviewed the current state of research on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. The socio-ecological model (SEM)—a public health framework that examines individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy impacts on health—was employed to describe impacts on menstrual health and hygiene. After a comprehensive literature review, 20 papers were included in this analysis, of which 18 were descriptive and two were interventional. The primary menstrual health and hygiene outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Key themes identified were knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, reproductive health issues, prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. The study results indicated lower menstrual health and hygiene challenges arose from lack of education around menstruation, lack of proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, poor sex education, and culturally restrictive practices. These challenges negatively impact women and girls’ reproductive health as well as mental health and school attendance. There is need for high quality, effective interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address improvements in menstrual health and hygiene at all levels of the socio-ecological model."

        "abstract": "As of 2020, about 21% of adults in the United States have a diagnosable mental health disorder, excluding substance use and developmental disorders. Depression, predicted by the WHO to be the leading cause of disease burden by 2030, is linked to various systemic conditions and has been associated with poor oral health. Both behavioral factors, like poor dental hygiene and irregular visits, and biological mechanisms, such as changes in salivary immunity, contribute to this connection, which impacts overall well-being and quality of life. This systematic review aims include: (1) Does tooth loss affect depression? (2) Does oral pain, such as that experienced during chewing and speaking, impact depression? (3) Does oral functionality, including chewing and speaking, influence depression? (4) Does overall oral health affect depression? We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EBSCO host, Medline, and Google Scholar databases from January 2000 to June 2024 using relevant keywords. Studies examining the impact of oral health parameters (tooth loss, oral pain, oral functionality, overall oral health) on depression were included. Articles were included if (1) full text manuscripts in English were available, (2) the study described the association of oral health and depression, and (3) the independent value was an oral related factor and the dependent value was depression. The following were excluded from our analysis: (1) any articles where oral factors were not the independent value, (2) systematic reviews, (3) case reports, and (4) duplicate studies among our databases. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Tooth loss, oral pain, and impaired oral functionality were consistently associated with increased depressive symptoms across the included studies. Greater tooth loss was linked to higher odds of both onset and progression of depression. Oral pain exacerbated depressive symptoms, while difficulties in chewing or speaking were associated with elevated risks of depression. There is a bidirectional relationship between oral health and depression, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive public health initiatives. Integrating oral health assessments into routine medical care, and developing targeted interventions are crucial steps to mitigate the impact of poor oral health on mental health outcomes."

The search strategy was restricted to publications in English before 1 December 2019 in the PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus and Web of Science databases. We only included oral diseases considered as public health issues with a global burden. As a result, investigations reporting the frequency of brushing, poor lifestyle behaviours, non-white ethnicity, DMFT scores and periodontal disease as an outcome were included. The two reviewers resolved any disagreements. Reviewers analysed the full texts, considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, a manual search of the reference lists was performed on all the selected studies. In total, 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Findings indicate a positive association between non-white ethnicity and PQoL among PW. Among PW, those who had non-white ethnicity were 1.43 times more likely to have PQoL (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.70). A positive association between DMFT and poor QoL among PW was also observed. Those who has suffered DMFT were 1.4 times more likely to have poor QoL (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.55). Results from this meta-analysis support the need for behavioural interventions for improving oral hygiene in expectant mothers. This could help to decrease periodontal conditions and improve their oral and general life quality."

Additionally, it aims to explore the impact of respiratory disease symptoms and treatments on the oral microbiome. The literature utilized in this review was sourced from studies focusing on the correlation between oral health and respiratory infections, spanning a period of 40 years. Various databases and scholarly sources were likely consulted to gather relevant research articles, reviews, and clinical studies. This review summarizes four decades-long research, providing insights into the intricate relationship between oral and respiratory health. It delves into how oral diseases influence respiratory tract conditions and vice versa. The selection process likely involved identifying studies that addressed the interaction between oral microbiome disruptions and respiratory complications. Oral diseases or poor oral habits have been known to increase the risk of getting respiratory infections. Modern techniques have demonstrated the relationship between oral disease and respiratory tract infections like influenza, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma, and Pneumonia. Apart from that, the medications used to treat respiratory diseases affect oral physiological factors like the pH of saliva, and saliva flow rate, which can cause significant changes in the oral microbiome. This review provides regular oral hygiene and care that can prevent respiratory health and respiratory infections. Understanding the intricate relationship between oral health and respiratory infections is crucial for healthcare providers. Implementing preventive measures and promoting good oral hygiene habits can reduce respiratory tract infections and improve overall respiratory health outcomes."

A search for articles that met these criteria was carried out in PUBMED, EMBASE, Lilacs, SCOPUS and also in the gray literature. At the end, nine studies were included. The results indicate that the population with higher vulnerability, lower income and lower educational level are the most affected, independently of the evaluated indicator (untreated dental caries, access to dental care services and hygiene habits). When protective measures with allocation of financial resources were taken, disparities decreased. It was concluded that, faced with economic crises, oral health is no longer a priority, which impacts access to care for the less favored social strata. O objetivo desse estudo foi analisar, por meio de uma revisão integrativa da literatura, os possíveis impactos das crises financeiras sobre os indicadores de saúde bucal em diferentes países, bem como verificar as medidas adotadas de forma a traçar um paralelo com a realidade brasileira. Uma busca de artigos que atendessem a estes critérios foi realizada nas bases PUBMED, EMBASE, Lilacs, SCOPUS e também na literatura cinzenta. Ao final, nove estudos foram incluídos. Os resultados indicam que a população em maior vulnerabilidade, menor renda e menor escolaridade são as mais afetadas, independentemente do indicador avaliado (cárie dentária não tratada, acesso aos serviços de Atenção Odontológica e hábitos de higiene). Quando medidas protetivas com alocação de recursos financeiras foram tomadas, as disparidades diminuíram. Concluiu-se que, frente às crises econômicas, a saúde bucal passa a não ser prioridade enquanto centro nucleador de políticas, o que impacta o acesso ao cuidado dos estratos sociais menos favorecidos."

A total of 225 especially abled children participated in the study, with a mean age of 12.5± 3.4 years. The participants included 130 males (57.8%) and 95 females (42.2%). Children with intellectual disabilities exhibited the highest mean DMFT (Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth) score (4.2 ± 2.3), with 75% of them affected by dental caries. In comparison, children with physical disabilities had a mean DMFT score of 3.6 ± 1.9 and a caries prevalence of 62%. Thus, the prevalence of dental caries and poor oral hygiene status is notably high among specially-abled children, particularly those with intellectual disabilities."

This article reviews models combining epidemiological and macroeconomic projections to enable policy makers to consider both macroeconomic and health objectives. A scoping review of epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 was conducted, covering preprints, working articles, and journal publications. We assessed model methodologies, scope, and application to empirical data. We found 80 articles modeling both the epidemiological and macroeconomic outcomes of COVID-19. Model scope is often limited to the impact of lockdown on health and total gross domestic product or aggregate consumption and to high-income countries. Just 14% of models assess disparities or poverty. Most models fall under 4 categories: compartmental-utility-maximization models, epidemiological models with stylized macroeconomic projections, epidemiological models linked to computable general equilibrium or input-output models, and epidemiological-economic agent-based models. We propose a taxonomy comparing these approaches to guide future model development. The epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 identified have varying complexity and meet different modeling needs. Priorities for future modeling include increasing developing country applications, assessing disparities and poverty, and estimating of long-run impacts. This may require better integration between epidemiologists and economists."

        "abstract": "The 1984 Mexico City Policy is a U.S. federal policy that has prohibited foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive U.S. international family planning assistance from using their own, non-U.S. funds to provide, counsel on, or refer for abortion services as a method of family planning, or advocate for the liberalization of abortion laws- except in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment. The policy became known as the global gag rule (GGR) due to its silencing effect on abortion advocacy. Historically, it has only been attached to family planning funding, until 2017 when a presidential memorandum expanded the policy to nearly all US$8.8 billion in global health foreign assistance. In light of the aforementioned expansion, this scoping review aimed to describe and map the impacts of the GGR on global health, which in turn would identify research and policy gaps. This is the first time that all of the existing literature on the policy's impact has been synthesized into one article and comprehensively reviewed. The review utilized Arksey and Malley's five-stage methodological framework to conduct a scoping review. Fourteen peer-reviewed databases and 25 grey literature sources were searched for publications between January 1984 and October 2017. Organizations and individuals working on GGR research and impact were also contacted to access their works from the same time period. These publications reported on impacts of the global gag rule on 14 domains in global health. The searches yielded 1355 articles, of which 43 were included. Overall, 80% of the identified sources were qualitative. The misunderstanding, miscommunication, and chilling effect of the policy underpinned the GGR's impacts. The frequently reported impacts on family planning delivery systems (34 articles) and the loss of U.S. funding (21 articles) were often related. Sources reported on the impact of the GGR on HIV and AIDS programs, advocacy and coalition spaces, and maternal and child health. Only three studies (6.9%) quantified associations between the GGR and abortion rates, concluding that the policy does not decrease rates of abortion. The GGR's development and implementation was consistently associated with poor impacts on health systems' function and outcomes. More peer-reviewed and quantitative research measuring and monitoring the policy's impact on health outcomes are needed. More research and policy analysis exploring the GGR's development and its implementation on the ground will improve knowledge on GGR consequences, and potentially shape its reform."

Recognizing these gaps, the One Health Action Commission (OHAC) was established as an academic community for One Health action with an emphasis on research agenda setting to identify actions for highest impact. This viewpoint describes the agenda of, and motivation for, the recently formed OHAC. Recognizing the urgent need for evidence to support the formulation of necessary action plans, OHAC advocates the adoption of both bottom-up and top-down approaches to identify the current gaps in combating zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance, addressing food safety, and to enhance capacity building for context-sensitive One Health implementation. By promoting broader engagement and connection of multidisciplinary stakeholders, OHAC envisions a collaborative global platform for the generation of innovative One Health knowledge, distilled practical experience and actionable policy advice, guided by strong ethical principles of One Health."

        "abstract": "Influenza viruses are known to be infected through epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. The oral cavity is in close anatomical proximity to the upper respiratory tract, and it is conceivable that the viruses could pass through the oral cavity and infect to the upper respiratory tract. Several researchers have suggested that colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae might affect the risk of influenza viral disease, indicating that oral hygiene and/or condition might play an important role in respiratory viral infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether an oral hygiene/condition might impact influenza infection. We conducted a retrospective observational study of Japanese citizens' regional cohort (N = 2,904) consisting of National Health Insurance beneficiaries who underwent annual health/dental examination with data entries in the Kokuho database (KDB). Trained dentists checked the oral hygiene/condition, and saliva specimens were examined using the LION dental saliva multi-test (SMT) kit. Influenza infection was identified from the diagnosis recorded in the KDB. The correlations between influenza infection and oral hygiene, dryness of the mouth, or various salivary test results were examined by a multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, age, recent smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, HbA1c, RBC for influenza infection. The logistic regression model showed that age significantly correlated with influenza infection. In addition, oral hygiene status had a nearly significant impact on influenza infection (p = 0.061), whereby, the subjects with poor oral hygiene had a higher risk of influenza infection than those with good oral hygiene (odds ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.89-2.95). Further, the prevalence of influenza infection was lower in the subjects with saliva weakly acidic and/or containing higher protein level. The results of this study suggested that the maintenance of oral health conditions might be one of the pivotal factors for preventing and reducing influenza infection."

A large body of evidence indicates that collegiate student athletes are not obtaining enough sleep, but less is known about their sleep quality, patterns, and the impact on health and performance. Consequently, short sleep negatively affects physical and mental health, as well as several domains of performance (ie, aerobic, anaerobic, sport-specific, cognitive). The majority of studies examining the links between short sleep, health, and performance have been conducted with healthy adults or noncollegiate athlete samples; however, collegiate student athletes have demands unlike those of their nonathlete or noncollegiate athlete counterparts. Poor sleep health and sleep disorders are of increasing concern among the college athlete population and have recently been recognized by national and international sports governing bodies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available literature on sleep and its impact on health and performance among athletes, specifically addressing gaps where little to no data is available on collegiate student athletes. Consideration is also given to evidence-based sleep interventions that have been utilized with athletes, as well as recommendations for future research and intervention development."

        "abstract": "Inadequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is an environmental risk factor for poor health outcomes globally, particularly for children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Despite technological advancements, many interventions aimed at improving WASH access return less than optimal results on long term impact, efficacy and sustainability. Research focus in the 'WASH sector' has recently expanded from investigating 'which interventions work' to 'how they are best implemented'. The 'acceptability' of an intervention is a key component of implementation that can influence initial uptake and sustained use. Acceptability assessments are increasingly common for health interventions in clinical settings. A broad scale assessment of how acceptability has been measured in the WASH sector, however, has not yet been conducted. We conducted a systematic literature review of intervention studies published between 1990 and 2021 that evaluated the acceptability of WASH interventions in LMIC settings. Using an implementation science approach, focused outcomes included how acceptability was measured and defined, and the timing of acceptability assessment. We conducted quality assessment for all included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised studies, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised studies. Of the 1238 records; 36 studies were included for the analysis, 22 of which were non-randomized interventions and 16 randomized or cluster-randomized trials. We found that among the 36 studies, four explicitly defined their acceptability measure, and six used a behavioural framework to inform their acceptability study design. There were few acceptability evaluations in schools and healthcare facilities. While all studies reported measuring WASH acceptability, the measures were often not comparable or described. As focus in WASH research shifts towards implementation, a consistent approach to including, defining, and measuring acceptability is needed."

The World Health Assembly commissioned a feasibility assessment of eliminating measles and rubella. The objective of this paper is to present the findings of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of ramping up MR vaccination with a goal of eliminating transmission in every country. We used projections of impact of routine and SIAs during 2018-2047 for four scenarios of ramping up MR vaccination. These were combined with economic parameters to estimate costs and disability-adjusted life years averted under each scenario. Data from the literature were used for estimating the cost of increasing routine coverage, timing of SIAs and introduction of rubella vaccine in countries. The CEA showed that all three scenarios with ramping up coverage above the current trend were more cost-effective in most countries than the 2018 trend for both measles and rubella. When the measles and rubella scenarios were compared with each other, the most cost-effective scenario was likely to be the most accelerated one. Even though this scenario is costlier, it averts more cases and deaths and substantially reduces the cost of treatment. The Intensified Investment scenario is likely the most cost-effective of the vaccination scenarios evaluated for reaching both measles and rubella disease elimination. Some data gaps on costs of increasing coverage were identified and future efforts should focus on filling these gaps."

To prepare for future crises and to preserve public health, we conduct an overview of systematic reviews to examine the evidence on the effect of the Great Recession on population health. We searched PubMed and Scopus for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses focusing specifically on the impact of the Great Recession on population health (eg, mental health). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed throughout this review and critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was performed using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. Twenty-one studies were identified and consistently showed that the Great Recession was most risky to health, the more a country's economy was affected and the longer strict austerity policies were in place. Consequently, a deterioration of health was highest in countries that had implemented strict austerity measures (eg, Greece), but not in countries that rejected austerity measures (eg, Germany). Moreover, the impact of the Great Recession fell disproportionately on the most vulnerable groups such as people in unemployment, at risk of unemployment and those living in poverty. The experiences of the last economic crisis show that it is possible to limit the consequences for health. Prioritising mental healthcare and prevention, foregoing austerity measures in the healthcare system and protecting vulnerable groups are the most important lessons learnt. Moreover, given the further aggravating social inequalities, a health in all policies approach, based on a comprehensive Health Impact Assessment, is advised."

All included publications presented data on clinical and/or subjective oral health outcomes in care home residents in Europe with no restrictions for language or study design. MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched, including publications from January 2010 onward. Data extraction and quality assessment (Qualsyst tool) was performed by 2 researchers independently. Findings were synthesized narratively, lack in data homogeneity restricted the relevance of a meta-analysis. Eighty-three papers from 18 countries were included in the systematic review, with a sample size ranging from 39 to 92,827 participants. Their mean age was older than 80 years. The residents had few natural teeth, with fewer than a third a functional natural dentition. Removable dentures were present in half to 80% of residents. A high prevalence of dental caries was reported. Oral hygiene was insufficient, for both natural teeth and removable dentures. Few residents had a healthy periodontium. Clinical treatment needs were found in most residents. Perceived treatment needs were high with at least one-third of care home residents reporting a need for care due to poor oral health. A fifth to half of the residents reported negative impacts of their oral condition on their everyday lives. This systematic review clearly highlights the poor oral health and high burden of oral conditions among care home residents across Europe, irrespective of country or health care system. There is need for substantial policy actions to improve oral health in care homes."

The impact of menstrual poverty is not well studied in developed countries. This study aims to estimate the impact of menstrual poverty on adolescents who reside in Nova Scotia (NS), Canada. A web-based, 25-item questionnaire, the adolescent Menstrual Poverty Questionnaire (aMPQ), was developed and distributed via social media. Adolescents less than 18 years of age, English-speaking and living in NS were eligible to complete the questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive analysis. Four hundred and twenty adolescents completed the questionnaire, with a mean age of 16.1 years (14.4-17.9 years). Results revealed that 65% of respondents do not always have enough money to buy menstrual products. This led to unsafe menstrual hygiene practices including using alternatives for menstrual products (e.g., rags), washing disposable menstrual products, and/or wearing products for longer than intended. Forty percent of respondents reported lack of affordability of menstrual products as a cause for school absenteeism and lack of participation in sport/social activities. Seventy percent of respondents felt embarrassed to ask for products even when they are provided for free, and almost all supported the idea of having freely available menstrual products in public washrooms. This study determined that menstrual poverty impacts adolescents in Nova Scotia. To address menstrual poverty, menstrual products should be freely available in all public washrooms, as this will provide unrestricted access to menstruators and promote their full participation in society."

The fields of global food security and nutrition (FSN) and mental health have historically been seen as separate fields of research. Each have undergone substantial transformation, especially from clinical, primary care orientations to wider, sociopolitical approaches to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. In recent years, the trajectories of research on mental health and FSN are further evolving into an intersection of evidence. FSN impacts mental health through various pathways such as food insecurity and nutrients important for neurotransmission. Mental health drives FSN outcomes, for example through loss of motivation and caregiving capacities. They are also linked through a complex and interrelated set of determinants. However, the heterogeneity of the evidence base limits inferences about these important dynamics. Furthermore, interdisciplinary projects and programmes are gaining ground in methodology and impact, but further guidance in integration is much needed. An evidence-driven conceptual framework should inform hypothesis testing and programme implementation. The intersection of mental health and FSN can be an opportunity to invest holistically in advancing thinking in both fields."

Factors such as extra vocal load, poor classroom acoustics, and health issues may increase a teacher's risk of acquiring a voice disorder that impacts his or her career. A common approach to treating or preventing voice disorders is the use of vocal hygiene training. Many studies have addressed different types of voice training with mixed results due to lengthy training programs, poor implementation, and other factors related to teacher motivation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether education on vocal hygiene practices would impact teachers' willingness to modify vocal behaviors. A group of 26 teachers from preschool to high school was sent pre- and post-training surveys to determine demographics, daily vocal use, and history of voice issues. The survey also assessed participants' likelihood to modify their behaviors to incorporate vocal hygiene practices into their daily lives. Between the pre- and post-training surveys, teachers received a one-hour training on vocal hygiene practices. This training consisted of basic information regarding the anatomy and physiology of the voice, healthy, and unhealthy vocal behaviors and the impact of phonotrauma behaviors, and positive effects of vocal hygiene techniques. Results showed that the impact of vocal hygiene training on teachers' willingness to incorporate vocally hygienic behaviors was statistically significant (d ≥ 0.80). Increases in study participant perceived desire to engage in vocal hygiene behaviors by virtue of vocal hygiene training was manifested in nearly 90% of the targeted vocal hygiene behaviors. In conclusion, teachers appear to benefit from receiving education on voice use and vocal hygiene techniques and show willingness to incorporate these techniques into their repertoires."

A comprehensive search was carried out in databases including PubMed, Google scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, Iran medex, Magiran and SID (Scientific information database) from 2000 to 2019. All original descriptive articles on flood were concerned. Related articles on flood disturbance were considered. Also, publication of red cross society was considered as only reliable reference in evaluation of consequences of flood occurred in 2019 in Iran. Flooding in Iran, was started in March 2019 and lasted to April 2019. Flood affected 31 provinces and 140 rivers burst their banks, and southwestern Iran being hit most severely. According the reports of international federation of red cross society, 3800 cities and villages were affected by the floods with 65,000 destroyed houses and 114,000 houses partially damaged. Also 70 hospitals or health care centers with 1200 schools were damaged along with many infrastructures including 159 main roads and 700 bridges. Considering 365,000 displaced persons and estimation of mentioned damages, it was one of the greatest natural disaster during the last 20 years. Various risk factors in favor of infectious diseases such as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation and human contact among refugees provide suitable conditions for increased incidence of infectious diseases after flooding and also cause epidemics.More attention is needed to provide hygienic situation for people after natural disasters including flood."

Recognizing that the health of people, animals, and the environment are connected, we present the rationale and research agenda for considering a One Health approach to child stunting. We contend that a One Health strategy may uncover new approaches to tackling child stunting by addressing several interdependent factors that prevent children from thriving in LMICs, and that coordinated interventions among human health, animal health, and environmental health sectors may have a synergistic effect in stunting reduction."

The impact of the cost-of-living crisis on the lowest paid members of the dental team is also considered.The most common dental diseases are closely correlated with social and economic deprivation and the points discussed here act as a reminder of how the present financial circumstances have significant potential to widen oral health inequalities."

By engaging a broad group of stakeholders, we generated research questions through a qualitative study (in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Uganda; n=101), consultations led by humanitarian agencies (n=259), and an expert panel (n=227; 51% female participants and 49% male participants; 84% of participants based in low-income and middle-income countries). The expert panel selected and rated a final list of 20 research questions. After rating, the MHPSS research agenda favoured applied research questions (eg, regarding workforce strengthening and monitoring and evaluation practices). Compared with research priorities for the previous decade, there is a shift towards systems-oriented implementation research (eg, multisectoral integration and ensuring sustainability) rather than efficacy research. Answering these research questions selected and rated by the expert panel will require improved partnerships between researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and communities affected by humanitarian crises, and improved equity in funding for MHPSS research in low-income and middle-income countries."

To assess the impact of oral health conditions on poor academic performance in schoolchildren by including a range of clinical and self-reported OH measures in a modified cross-sectional study. This study was carried out on schoolchildren aged 12-14 years in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, using a stratified and randomised cluster sampling method. Clinical indices from oral screening and self-reported OH conditions and behaviours and school absence from the self-administered questionnaire were recorded a month before the school examination. Results of passing or failing the examination were obtained after the examination. Statistical associations were examined using bivariate and multiple logistic regressions. The oral health measures were categorised based on the types of conditions and briefly appraised. Measures of dental caries, dental pain, soft tissue problems, oral hygiene, tooth discolouration, tooth mobility and school absence due to dental pain were associated with greater odds of failing the examination (p < .05). Measures of dental treatment and absence due to dental visits were associated with lower odds of failing (p < .05). Dental caries with pain likely explains the poor academic performance of schoolchildren, whereas treatment has a protective effect."

Period poverty adversely affects the health of anyone capable of menstruating, which is nearly half of the world population, at the physiological, emotional, and psychosocial level. Biases, cultural beliefs, ethical reproductive justice issues, social stigma, and systemic factors contribute to period poverty. Every month, certain menstruators are disproportionately impacted by period poverty and struggle to access basic hygienic necessities. Important stakeholders include not only the individual who experiences menses but also educators and school systems, healthcare professionals, policymakers, public health officials, and researchers. Everyone has a role in addressing period poverty by voting for officials that proactively support legislation, policy, and programs at all levels to effectively advocate for menstrual equity and address barriers contributing to period poverty. This includes policies that increase access to menstrual hygiene products, safe menstrual management methods, and reproductive and women's health education. Programs globally that focus on capacity building and sustainability strategies can be used as models to reduce period poverty, thereby fostering a sense of empowerment and menstruators' sense of autonomy, dignity, and equality."

        "abstract": "The objective of this scoping review was to identify what is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the physical and mental well-being of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons. The aim was also to identify barriers influencing access to treatment or prevention. The search was conducted using PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. A mixed methods appraisal tool was used to assess methodological rigor. The study findings were synthesized using a thematic analysis approach. This review comprised 24 studies and were conducted utilizing a mixed method approach incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Two major themes were identified related to the impact of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons and the key barriers influencing access to treatment or prevention of COVID-19. They often have barriers to accessing healthcare due to their legal status, language barriers, and limited resources. The pandemic has further strained already limited health resources, making it even more challenging for these populations to receive healthcare. This review reveals that refugees and asylum seekers in receiving facilities face a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population due to their less favorable living conditions. The various health impacts stem from a lack of access to accurate information about the pandemic, misinformation, and the exacerbation of pre-existing mental health issues caused by heightened stress, anxiety, and uncertainty, fear of deportation among undocumented migrants, and overcrowding camps and detention facilities that increase exposure risk. Social distancing measures are difficult to implement in these settings, and inadequate sanitation, hygiene, and a lack of personal protective equipment further compound the problem. Moreover, the pandemic has had significant economic consequences for these populations. Many of them rely on informal or precarious employment, which has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Job losses and reduced working hours, and limited access to social protection can lead to increased poverty, and food insecurity. Children faced specific challenges, such as disruptions to education, additionally, interruptions in support services for pregnant women. Some pregnant women have avoided seeking maternity care due to fears of contracting COVID-19, resulting in increased home births and delays in accessing healthcare services. Factors that play a role in vaccination reluctance include uncertainty of undocumented migrants' inclusion in vaccination programs, furthermore, a growing vaccine hesitancy in the population; skepticism about the safety of vaccines, inadequate knowledge/education, a variety of access barriers such as language barriers, and logistical challenges including remote locations, and inaccurate information. This review highlights that the physical health of refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, and internally displaced persons has been significantly impacted by various barriers to healthcare access during the pandemic. These barriers include legal and administrative challenges, such as a lack of documentation. Additionally, the shift to digital tools has introduced new obstacles, not only due to language barriers or limited technical knowledge but also because of structural barriers, such as the requirement of a bank ID that is often inaccessible to these groups. Other factors contributing to limited healthcare access include financial constraints, language barriers, and discrimination. Additionally, limited access to accurate information about health services, prevention measures, and available resources may hinder them from seeking care or following public health guidelines. Misinformation and lack of trust in healthcare systems can also contribute to a reluctance to access care or vaccination programs. There is concerning evidence regarding vaccine hesitancy that needs to be addressed to reduce any future pandemic outbreak, in addition there is a need to explore the factors that play a role in vaccination reluctance among children in these populations."

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health and reviewed abstracts from HIV conferences from 2017 to 2018 for studies reporting primary data on PrEP continuation. Findings were summarized along a PrEP cascade and continuation was presented by population at months 1, 6 and 12, with random-effects meta-analysis. Of 2578 articles and 596 abstracts identified, 41 studies were eligible covering 22 034 individuals. Continuation data were measured and reported inconsistently. Results showed high discontinuation at month 1 and persistent discontinuation at later time points in many studies. Pooled continuation estimates were 66% at month 1 [n = 5348; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 48-82], 63% at month 6 (n = 13 629; 95% CI: 48-77) and 71% at month 12 (n = 14 933; 95% CI: 60-81; higher estimate than previous timepoints due to inclusion of different studies). Adequate data were not available to reliably compare estimates across populations. This review found that discontinuation at one month was high, suggesting PrEP initiations may be a poor measure of effectiveness. Continuation declined further over time in many studies, indicating existing cross-sectional indicators may not be adequate to understand PrEP use patterns. Studies do not measure continuation consistently, and consensus is needed."

This paper leverages teachers' perspectives on menstruation and the impact of the Menstrual Solutions (MS) study, an open cluster randomized controlled feasibility study to determine the impact of puberty education, nurses support, and menstrual product provision on girls' academic performance and emotional well-being. Seventeen focus group discussions were conducted from October 2012 through November 2013 with teachers at six participating schools, held at three different time points during the study period. Key themes that emerged were emotions and blood, absenteeism, the role of teachers in MHH, and the impact of sensitization. Teachers noted that poor MHH had an impact on school attendance, transparency and openness with teachers, and student behavior in class. It was reported that adolescent girls would absent themselves for 3-5 days during their menstrual cycle depending on what materials they could use, and they would often shy away from teachers, when possible, only speaking to them about their menses if it was urgent or they needed to go home. Emotions such as fear and embarrassment were commonly associated with bleeding. At the midpoint and end of the study, teachers noted that the puberty education and menstrual product provision (where applicable) had a positive impact on girls' attendance, attention, and comfort in the classroom. Girls became more open with both male and female teachers about their menses, and more comfortable and confident in the classroom among all classmates. This research highlights the importance of building an MHH-supportive environment with multiple school personnel within schools to develop a gender-equitable environment for girls to learn confidently without undue interference. Teachers are key adults in adolescent girls' lives, having the potential to foster an environment that empowers girls with greater autonomy to manage their menses. This highlights a need to consider their perspectives in intervention development. Sensitization of teachers and puberty education across both genders are key components to developing the MHH-supportive environment in schools."

The proportion of older adults in need of HHCS will increase in the coming years. Previous studies indicate that frail and dependent older adults are at increased risk for oral diseases, due to challenges with daily oral hygiene and regular access to dental services. Four databases were searched in November 2020 for relevant literature. Search terms included a comprehensive list of terms for adults 65 years or older receiving HHCS, clinical and subjective oral health indicators, and OHRQoL. The literature was reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the 3114 sources identified, 18 were included. Data on oral diseases and symptoms among older adults receiving HHCS were limited and heterogeneous. Overall, older adults often lacked some of their natural teeth and often had removable dentures that needed repair. In addition, plaque, caries, xerostomia, and chewing and swallowing problems were common among the population group. Data on OHRQoL were scarce and indicated a positive association with a higher number of present teeth, while decayed teeth, root remnants, and dry mouth had substantial negative impacts on the daily activities of older adults receiving HHCS. This scoping review show that older adults above 65 years receiving HHCS generally have poor oral health status and that there is a knowledge gap regarding their OHRQoL."

Social innovation may provide a framework for expanding access to diagnostics in the global south. Here social innovation is defined as implementing a known public health tool via a novel, community-driven technique. In this article, we discuss three diverse cases that show the potential for using social innovation in diagnostics. The cases chosen for inclusion here demonstrate the importance of social innovation in diagnostics across different geographic, cultural, and health system contexts. They include malaria testing via schools in Malawi, cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) sample self-collection in Peru, and crowdsourcing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in China. For each case, we present the public health problem and the impact of using social innovation to increase accessibility of diagnostics. We discuss implications of each diagnostic approach and the importance of social innovation in creating these potential solutions. We argue that social innovation is useful in improving the delivery of essential diagnostic tools in low- and middle-income countries. Interventions in Malawi, Peru, and China suggest social innovation increases uptake of diagnostics. The same tools and principles utilized in these cases can be adapted for use in other contexts. Such diagnostic innovations may help improve identification of and linkage to care for many diseases. The approach presents a unique opportunity to better address public health issues and increase accessibility in LMIC health systems."

In French Guiana, most incarcerated women come from unsafe environments and are incarcerated because of drug trafficking. Medical follow-up processes used in prison (medical assessment on arrival, and then two half-days per week upon request but without an obstetrician-gynecologist) does not allow for a thorough assessment of the impact of incarceration on women prisoners' health to take place. In the absence of data, the purpose of this study was to describe incarcerated women's experiences in relation to sexual and reproductive health. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among French-speaking adult women who had been incarcerated for at least four months in a French Guianan prison. Menstruation, contraception, pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted infections and sexuality were described by means of interpretative phenomenological analysis. A total of 14 women were interviewed. They suffered from menstrual cycle disorders, poor hygiene and menstrual insecurity. They appeared to have emotionally disinvested sexuality. However, intra-prison sexual activity existed for some (masturbation, conjugal prison visits, homosexual intercourse between fellow prisoners). Homosexual relations were a source of discrimination. Being pregnant while incarcerated was viewed negatively. A lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and high-risk behaviors such as piercing and tattooing practices were widespread. Incarceration is a vulnerable time for women's sexual and reproductive health. Sexual activity exposes women to risks and discrimination that should be taken into account in a multidisciplinary approach adapted to the prison environment."

Multiple logistic regression was employed to explore associations between lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and tooth-brushing frequency. Around 10.8% of the students brushed their teeth less frequently than the recommended twice-daily regimen. Male gender, lower socio-economic status, poor dietary practice, longer sedentary time, drug use, psychological distress, less peer support, and no parental support were associated with infrequent tooth brushing. The findings support the need to integrate oral health promotion into general health actions that target families, schools, and social environments of adolescents to develop healthier habits."

The aim of the present study was to assess the OHRQoL, and the presence of caries, plaque and gingivitis in Turkish preschool children with CHD as compared to children without CHD (control group). Children aged 3-6 years with CHD (n = 75) and a control group (n = 75) were included in the study. Examinations were conducted using the plaque index (PI), the gingival index (GI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) caries diagnostic criteria. The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) questionnaire was completed by the children's families. The amount of caries and plaque, as well as the number of missing teeth were higher in children with CHD. The OHRQoL was lower in children with CHD. However, the differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The number of filled teeth was significantly higher in the control group (p < 0.05). According to the findings of the present study, the high amount of caries and plaque in both groups demonstrates that caries continues to be a major public health problem. Although there was no significant difference in terms of QoL scale scores between the 2 groups, the study showed that OHRQoL was lower in children with CHD."

This review highlights sleep's instrumental biological functions, various sleep problems, and sleep hygiene and lifestyle interventions that can help improve sleep quality. Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9 h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep. These sleep hygiene practices can promote better quality and duration of sleep, with corresponding health benefits."

        "abstract": "Caries is a multifactorial degenerative disease, and it is the most common chronic disease during childhood. Few studies have assessed the effects of breastfeeding and bottle feeding on children's dental caries, also taking into account the duration of both options. We investigated whether the infant feeding duration and feeding methods (breast, bottle or both) are risk factors for dental caries in childhood. Our study included 210 children from 2 to 6 years old and it was carried out in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry of Borgo Cavalli (Treviso, Italy). The average number of decayed, missing, and filled primary tooth surfaces (DMFT) were investigated by analyzing the medical histories. Data collection was conducted from September 2021 to July 2022. Data analysis was performed using the statistical program R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). First, an analysis was performed to verify the database using a graph. We used the negative Poisson and Binomial count model for the data. Next, the verification of which covariables were significant was performed, finally the conclusions were obtained. By dividing the population according to the type of feeding, we saw that most of the children participating in the study had between 3 and 7 cavities. By analyzing the length of feeding, we saw that the average duration was between 10 and 20 months. Due to the P values, we concluded that the total duration of feeding variable was not significant in explaining the event of interest and, therefore, only the variable type of feeding (artificial and natural) was significant because the P value was below the 5% significance level. Finally, we concluded that natural type breastfeeding increases the average amount of caries by 1.29 times, or 29% more than artificial feeding. Compared to bottle-feeding, breastfeeding increases the risk of caries at an early age; however, there is no correlation between duration and occurrence of caries. Meanwhile, considering health benefits, dental professionals should not discourage breastfeeding; as a matter of fact, promoting breastfeeding has many benefits for infants and mothers, provided that it is associated with proper oral hygiene."

Each bovine colostrum has a unique biochemical composition with high nutraceutical value compared to milk. However, bovine colostrum is influenced by various factors, such as environmental, individual, and genetic factors, as well as processing methods. Proper colostrum management is crucial for obtaining high-quality colostrum and mitigating bacterial contamination. This is important not only for the health and survival of calves but also for the health of humans who consume colostrum and its co-products. It is essential to ensure that the consumed colostrum is free of pathogens to reap its benefits. Health-promoting products based on colostrum have gained significant interest. However, colostrum can contain pathogens that, if not eliminated, can contribute to their transmission and spread, as well as antibiotic resistance. The aim of this review was to promote the animal and human health benefits of bovine colostrum by improving its microbial quality and highlighting potential routes of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Implementing hygienic measures is one of the key factors in mitigating colostrum bacterial contamination and obtaining safe and high-quality colostrum. This helps reduce the exposure of pathogens to newborn calves, other animals, and humans, in a One Health analysis."

Chlorhexidine (CHX) is an established oral antiseptic used in the treatment of periodontal disease, but its role in orthodontic therapy is unclear. To assess the efficacy of adjunct use of CHX-containing products in maintaining gingival health among orthodontic patients with fixed appliances. Five databases were searched without limitations up to August 2021. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing Gingival Index (GI) (primary outcome), Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding Index (BI), or Pocket Probing Depth (PPD). Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were done independently in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analyses of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were conducted, followed by sensitivity and Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation analysis. Twenty RCTs (1001 patients) were included assessing CHX-containing mouthwashes (n = 11), toothpastes (n = 2), gels (n = 3), or varnishes (n = 4) compared to placebo/control (n = 19) or sodium fluoride-products (n = 4). In the short-term, CHX-containing mouthwash was associated with lower GI (n = 9; MD = -0.68; 95% CI = -0.97 to -0.38; P < 0.001; high quality), lower PI (n = 9; MD = -0.65; 95% CI = -0.86 to -0.43; P < 0.001; high quality), lower BI (n = 2; SMD = -1.61; 95% CI = -2.99 to -0.22; P = 0.02; low quality), and lower PPD (n = 2; MD = -0.60 mm; 95% CI = -1.06 to -0.14 mm; P = 0.01; low quality). No considerable benefits were found from the use of CHX-gel or CHX-varnish in terms of GI, PI, or PPD (P > 0.05/low quality in all instances). Use of a CHX-containing toothpaste was more effective in lowering PI (Heintze-index) than adjunct use of fluoride-containing mouthwash (n = 2; MD = -5.24; 95% CI = -10.46 to -0.02; P = 0.04), but not GI (P = 0.68) or BI (P = 0.27), while sensitivity analyses indicated robustness. Adjunct use of CHX mouthwash during fixed-appliance treatment is associated with improved gingival inflammation, plaque control, and pocket depths, but caution is warranted and recommendations about CHX use during orthodontic treatment of children/adults should consider the heterogeneous patient response, cost-effectiveness, and potential adverse effects.

        "abstract": "Non-surgical chronic wounds, including diabetes-related foot diseases (DRFD), pressure injuries (PIs) and venous leg ulcers (VLU), are common hard-to-heal wounds. Wound evolution partly depends on microbial colonisation or infection, which is often confused by clinicians, thereby hampering proper management. Current routine microbiology investigation of these wounds is based on in vitro culture, focusing only on a limited panel of the most frequently isolated bacteria, leaving a large part of the wound microbiome undocumented. A literature search was conducted on original studies published through October 2022 reporting metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of chronic wound samples. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they applied 16 S rRNA metagenomics or shotgun metagenomics for microbiome analysis or diagnosis. Case reports, prospective, or retrospective studies were included. However, review articles, animal studies, in vitro model optimisation, benchmarking, treatment optimisation studies, and non-clinical studies were excluded. Articles were identified in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, Crossref and Semantic Scholar databases. Of the 3,202 articles found in the initial search, 2,336 articles were removed after deduplication and 834 articles following title and abstract screening. A further 14 were removed after full text reading, with 18 articles finally included. Data were provided for 3,628 patients, including 1,535 DRFDs, 956 VLUs, and 791 PIs, with 164 microbial genera and 116 species identified using mNGS approaches. A high microbial diversity was observed depending on the geographical location and wound evolution. Clinically infected wounds were the most diverse, possibly due to a widespread colonisation by pathogenic bacteria from body and environmental microbiota. mNGS data identified the presence of virus (EBV) and fungi (Candida and Aspergillus species), as well as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas bacteriophages. This study highlighted the benefit of mNGS for time-effective pathogen genome detection. Despite the majority of the included studies investigating only 16 S rDNA, ignoring a part of viral, fungal and parasite colonisation, mNGS detected a large number of bacteria through the included studies. Such technology could be implemented in routine microbiology for hard-to-heal wound microbiota investigation and post-treatment wound colonisation surveillance."

        "abstract": "Common mental disorders (CMDs) impose significant socioeconomic impacts on the global community. Nevertheless, over 50% of individuals with CMDs do not receive proper treatment, indicating that the current treatment modalities do not adequately tackle this issue. Since single-session therapy (SST) is a potential method for reducing the treatment gap, it is crucial to evaluate its effectiveness. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SST on CMD symptoms in adults. This systematic review included randomised and non-randomised studies assessing the clinical effectiveness of SST on CMD symptoms in adults. English-written, peer-reviewed studies or dissertations were included, while grey literature was excluded. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane's CENTRAL were searched on December 13, 2022, from their inception dates. The risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I. A narrative synthesis was performed. This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database on July 6, 2022 (CRD42022343925). Six randomised and three non-randomised studies were included after screening 2,130 records. Three non-randomised studies with a \"critical\" or \"serious\" risk of bias were excluded from the synthesis. Therefore, six randomised trials involving 298 participants were included in the synthesis. Four out of six studies had a \"high\" risk of bias. The participants had non-severe symptoms at baseline, and three intervention types (behavioural activation, DBT, and solution-focused psychotherapy) were evaluated. Five of six studies showed positive results for depression, with only one reporting a positive result for anxiety. SST may be effective in improving CMD symptoms in adults, particularly depression. However, there is a limit to deriving definite conclusions due to a high risk of bias in included studies, insufficient sample size and research volume. Further research exploring the characteristics of clients who can benefit from SST is required to facilitate its widespread use."

However, there is a significant shortage of statistics on the status of WASH in Healthcare Facilities (WinHCF), resulting in roadblocks in developing improvement strategies. Further, there is a lack of detailed comparison of WASH components covered in available tools against the standards. The present study aims to dissect the national and international tools for WASH assessment in HCFs to suggest comprehensive WASH indicators. The databases like PubMed, Scopus, ScopeMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar were used to extract the available tools. The assessment process, methodology, and components of national and various international tools were compared and synthesized. A total of seven tools, namely WASH FIT 2, Facet, SARA, SPA, TOOL BOX-II, CDC and Kayakalp, were compared on eight components: water, sanitation, hand hygiene, healthcare waste, environmental cleaning and hygiene, infrastructure, workforce management, policy and protocols. Although most tools have covered the same indicators, the methodology and definitions differ. Few of the tools fail to capture the basic indicators defined by Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). The critical indicators of policy and protocols are only covered in WASH FIT 2, Kayakalp, and TOOL BOX-II. Likewise, most tools fail to capture the indicator of cleaning, IPC practices and climate resilience. The present review also highlighted the limitations of selected tools regarding definitions, methodology and implementation. Hence, based on the review findings, a comprehensive short tool has been developed to monitor WASH in HCF of India. It comprises all the essential fundamental indicators identified from various tools, and recommended by the JMP service ladder with proper definitions. This tool can be helpful for hospital staff and managers for the routine monitoring of WASH in HCFs and improve the quality of care and IPC practices in HCFs."

Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly.

        "abstract": "Diarrhoeal disease is one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in India. It affects all ages, yet very few studies have been found regarding the young and older children affected by diarrhoea and its etiology. About 2.2 million deaths are attributed to diarrhoea alone in India every year. However, a large number of diarrhoeal cases may be avoided with proper sanitation and hygiene practices. The primary aim of this study was to assess the current water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practises among mothers and diarrhoea among their children (6 months to 11 years) in rural households of the Mayurbhanj district, Odisha. Further, the association between WASH practises and childhood diarrhoeal disease was assessed. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 430 mothers by using a pre-tested structured questionnaire adapted from previous studies. Data collection was done using the software Epicollect5 by the trained data collector. The data were further transformed to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) version 23 for analysis to find out potential risk factors. A multistage sampling technique was used to find subjects. Out of 430 households, 21.6% of respondents reported that their children were suffering from diarrhoea in the last two weeks from the day of the survey. Nearly 63.8% of respondents mentioned that they used to supply water as a principal source for household purposes. This study found that children of households near waste piles are more at risk of having diarrhoea than those households living far from the waste pile [AOR: 4.996; 95% CI: (2.173, 11.487)]. In the management of household wastes, households who are throwing waste here and there are 3.276 times more at risk of having diarrhoea than households who are managing the wastes by themselves by burning them outside the home [AOR: 3.276; 95%CI: (1.463, 7.042)]. In the disposal of child faeces, it was found that the household children's faeces disposed of in the garbage or dumping site are 2.438 times more at risk of having diarrhoea than those who are flushing the faeces in the latrine [AOR: 2.438; 95%CI: (1.284, 4.631)]. Also, using footwear less often was found to be highly associated with an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea (AOR: 1.634; 95% CI (.815, 3.276). Findings indicate that creating awareness about the benefits of proper management of household waste and using footwear on a regular basis is the priority to avoid childhood diarrhoea. Further, area-specific planning and programme allocation of resources is necessary to prevent childhood diarrhoea."

Further, the persistent plaque may result in the continued destruction of the surrounding soft and hard tissues. During fixed orthodontic therapy, arch-wires, brackets, and elastic modules have been shown to be sites of significant plaque accumulation, making it difficult for a patient to maintain proper oral hygiene. The problem most dentists face is that they cannot visualize this biofilm completely to be able to carry out efficient plaque removal. Visual assessment is, to date, the most common method for plaque visualization, and various indexes have been demonstrated to be sufficient for quantification of the amount of plaque present. However, the problem is that visual assessments are inconsistent, operator dependent and often subjective, which can lead to inconsistency in results. Fluorescence is one such method that can be explored for its use in effective plaque identification and removal. Literature has it that dentists and patients find it particularly useful for monitoring oral hygiene status during treatment. Fluorescence has the capability of offering clinical orthodontists and researchers a new method of detection of demineralization during orthodontic treatment, furthermore, for efficient removal of orthodontic adhesive cements, fluorescent light may be used in conjunction with high-speed burs to deliver fast, less time consuming, and safer results. The benefit of direct visual treatment using fluorescence enhanced theragnosis is that the patient receives controlled and guided therapy. It has multiple benefits, such as early diagnosis of caries, biofilm identification, and even helps to achieve improved treatment outcomes by better resin selection for esthetic procedures."

However, health education must start from an early age, in order to monitor the child's growth and prevent pathologies. Schools are in charge of the overall education of children and of guidance to parents but could also be engaged in the promotion of oral health, supported and counseled by pediatricians and dentists. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether school age children could be taught, successfully, basic oral sciences and dental hygiene, by a professional, during school hours. In this pilot study, an anonymized test was administered to 45 children of age between 8 and 10, both before and after an interactive lecture on oral health, to assess the effectiveness of the lesson and acquisition by the children of knowledge on oral health. After the presentation, the majority of the children were able to answer correctly to the questionnaire that was given to them (test, retest) which was related to dental anatomy and pathology (number of teeth, cavities, halitosis), and dental hygiene tools and practices (brushes, floss, mouth wash, tongue scrapers). The children seemed to be receptive to learning while in school, and a specific educational session of dental hygiene and oral health seems to be the right approach to ensure children can identify dental hygiene tools and use them appropriately."

Unfortunately, health care worker compliance with HH is imperfect. We sought to improve HH compliance using an electronic hand hygiene monitoring system (EHHMS) in 2 units to collect unbiased data and provide feedback. In this prospective, quasi-experimental study, the Hyginex EHHMS was installed in 2 units at Tufts Medical Center. Ninety-one bracelets were assigned, and electronic data were collected over 8 months. Human observations continued. We compared HH compliance as measured by human observation before, during, and after EHHMS implementation. Pre- and post-implementation surveys were distributed to staff. The number of electronically captured HH compliance observations was small due to infrequent bracelet use after month 2 of the intervention. HH compliance, as determined by human observation, increased by an average of 1.3 percentage points per month (P = .0005). Survey responses revealed negative attitudes about the EHHMS before and after its implementation. Despite poor EHHMS participation and negative attitudes toward its implementation, HH compliance, as measured by human observation, significantly improved. Hospitals considering implementing an EHHMS should look to refine the intervention to encourage health care worker participation."

Strategies to reduce it aim to improve people's risk perception about vaccine-preventable diseases, fill knowledge gaps about vaccines and increase trust in healthcare providers. During pregnancy, educational interventions can provide a proper knowledge about safety and efficacy of maternal and childhood vaccinations. Fighting hesitancy and clarifying doubts is fundamental during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected people's knowledge and beliefs toward vaccination. This study aimed at assessing if the advent of the pandemic was associated with changes in pregnant women's knowledge and beliefs toward vaccination, and trust in healthcare services. A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted through self-reported questionnaires in a Roman teaching hospital, where educational classes about vaccinations are routinely held as part of a birthing preparation course. Data were collected on a sample of pregnant women before and during the pandemic. Free-of-charge flu vaccinations were offered to all course participants and adherence to flu vaccination was assessed. The proportion of pregnant women reporting that vaccines have mild side effects and that are sufficiently tested increased from 78.6 to 92.0% ( The pandemic may have positively affected pregnant women's knowledge and opinions about vaccinations and trust in HCWs, despite a possible negative impact on their perceptions about NHS operators. This should inspire Public Health professionals to rethink their role as health communicators."

Through clinical and radiographic parameters; this study assesses the association between mini-screws and periodontal health. A prospective observational study included 16 systemically healthy non-smoking individuals requiring mini-screws. Mini-screws with a rough, titanium oxide-coated surface were placed. Periodontal assessments (Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, gingival recession, bleeding on probing, mucosal discomfort, mucosal redness, keratinized tissue width, supracrestal tissue height, and transmucosal soft tissue thickness) were performed at 2nd week and 3 months post-placement. Radiographic evaluations measured distances between mini-screws and adjacent teeth using Image J software. The study included 13 females and 3 males (mean age 21.9 ± 1.8 years) with 24 mini-screws. Early mini-screw loss was not observed. Significant reductions in site-level Gingival Index and bleeding on probing (p < 0.05) and full-mouth bleeding on probing (p < 0.05) were noted over time. Absence of significant differences was found in mucosal discomfort and redness, keratinized tissue width, or transmucosal soft tissue thickness, but supracrestal tissue height decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Radiographically, significant bone reduction around mini-screws was observed at 3 months, with torque gauge values significantly decreased as well (p < 0.05). Orthodontic mini-screws can be effectively utilized in orthodontic treatment with proper planning and monitoring. While improvements in gingival health were observed with targeted oral care, the study underscores the need for careful consideration of potential risks to periodontal tissues, such as reductions in supracrestal tissue height and bone levels. A balanced approach that integrates preventive strategies with precise screw placement is essential to maximize the benefits of mini-screws while minimizing potential periodontal complications. While proper oral hygiene can help control inflammation around mini-screw sites, clinicians must also be mindful of potential risks, such as reductions in bone levels and tissue height. Careful patient selection, precise placement, and regular follow-up are crucial to ensure the stability of mini-screws' stability and to prevent complications, ultimately contributing to better treatment outcomes in orthodontic care. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT06491849 on June 28, 2024."

Both patients and clinicians' expectations appear to be addressed with clear aligner therapy achieving an aesthetic appearance and fewer side effects, mainly due to the difficult maintenance of proper oral hygiene in the conventional fixed approach. Research has partially confirmed these key points of CAT but similarly revealed several limitations to the overall benefit of this treatment. Both the aforementioned key points of the CAT are currently under discussion: the aesthetic appearance is not uniform, due to the presence in some cases of extensive need for attachments, and the better periodontal conditions are certainly present in the CAT but mainly limited to the short term. This critical review of the state of the art clarifies the gray areas, such as to inform the researcher with the aim of elaborating an adequate study design in order to evaluate the advantages and limitations of this orthodontic approach."

This review evaluates different vaccines used for its control and summarizes the benefits of 'global vaccine' in the four major domestic livestock species, namely goat, sheep, buffalo and cattle. Vaccines developed by using 'native strains' revealed both 'therapeutic' and preventive effects in domestic livestock. The 'therapeutic' role of vaccine in animals suffering from clinical JD turned out to be valuable in some cases by reversing the disease process and animals returning back to health and production. Good herd management, improved hygiene, 'test and cull' methodology, proper disposal of animal excreta and monitoring of MAP bio-load were also regarded as crucial in the 'therapeutic' management of JD. Vaccine approaches have been widely adopted in JD control programs and may be considered as a valuable adjunct in order to utilize huge populations of otherwise un-productive livestock. It has been shown that vaccination was the preeminent strategy to control JD, because it yielded approximately 3-4 times better benefit-to-cost ratios than other strategies. Internationally, 146 vaccine trials/studies have been conducted in different countries for the control of JD and have shown remarkable reduction in its national prevalence. It is concluded that for JD, there cannot be global vaccines or diagnostic kits as solutions have to come from locally prevalent strains of MAP. Despite some limitations, vaccines might still be an effective strategy to reduce or eradicate JD."

As there is a drastic increase in the aging population, so did the use of removable dentures more than ever before. The use of dentures among the elderly provides functional advantages and esthetic benefits. However, improper use and poor oral hygiene with removable dentures come with complications, including denture stomatitis, ulcerations, pneumonia, and many more. The study aims to determine the complications associated with inappropriate use and poor oral care and bring forth evidence-based dentist-recommended guidelines for denture maintenance. Articles were systematically screened in PubMed/Medline (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), PubMed Central (PMC), and Cochrane Library using keywords. Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) was also utilized to identify relevant articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, duplicate articles were discarded, and then the articles were reviewed by title and abstract screening. The remaining articles went through a detailed full-text review. A quality appraisal check was conducted for each unique type of research publication, after which a total of 22 articles were finalized. In this study, we have seen pathological biofilm formation on dentures, life-threatening pneumonia, denture stomatitis, and accidental ingestion/aspiration of dentures amongst the elderly population. The study also identified members with low literacy rates, minorities, and low-income families seem to be at higher risk of poor oral care and denture hygiene. We identified that most of these complications could be prevented with proper guidance and education. In the future, a further detailed study is important as no clear consensus exists in terms of best practices of denture cleaning methods. In addition, measures should be initiated to encourage regular dentist appointments and increase accessibility among members of low socioeconomic status and minorities."

Safe WASH practices have the potential to greatly reduce these statistics but behaviour change interventions in the field have yielded little success to date. Currently, there is an emphasis on addressing cognitive processes to bring about changes in behaviour. In this review, a case is made for the benefits of a contingency-based perspective, focusing on the contextual antecedents and consequences of behaviour. The role of contingencies of reinforcement, not explored in previous WASH literature, is discussed as an explanatory framework for designing behaviour change strategies. A proper use of contrived reinforcers is recommended to counterbalance the natural reinforcers of convenience associated with risk practices. Recognising the role of consequences in the acquisition and maintenance of behaviour is an important step in the search for the answers urgently needed in the WASH field."

This is because of weak immunity and lack of knowledge on proper hand hygiene. This quasi-experimental study assessed the efficacy of an intervention consisting of a hand hygiene education programme, along with digital tools in bringing about a change in behaviour and health conditions amongst pre-school children in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A total of 377 school children, male and female, aged 5-6 years old, participated and were assigned to either the intervention or a control group. During the 2 months intervention period, children in the test group were trained on proper hand hygiene practices and techniques with the aid of the interactive android-based tablets. The numbers of absent days of all the children were recorded for 2 months before the intervention and during the intervention. In the test group, there was a 25% increase in the total number of absent days from the pre-intervention period to the intervention period, a much lesser increment observed as compared to that of control group in which the increase was much higher at 89%. Results showed a significant difference (P < 0·05) between the absenteeism rates for the test and control group during the intervention period. These results suggest that proper education and intervention increase hand hygiene compliance, which may help decrease school absenteeism due to illness; however, a longer study duration may be necessary to evaluate the benefit further."

As the role of the state construction welfare board has been crucial, some existing issues related to boards and challenges emerged during the crisis have also been discussed. Results show that cash benefit through direct benefit transfer has partially helped workers to overcome their financial distress, but 65% workers did not receive any benefit due to various issues related to registration and seeding of bank accounts with Aadhar. Sluggish process of registration has been a major issue which is being addressed by different mechanisms, but results would be known later. Proper cess collection and its utilisation is still an important issue as 61% of the cess collected in 2019 was not utilised. Even during the crisis, 15% cess was used at most in direct benefit transfer and in-kind (food distribution) support. Majority of the states are running a number of welfare schemes, but the coverage is poor despite proper guidelines set under the Model Welfare Framework of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The objectives of Mission Mode Projects are appreciable, but the outcomes are not known even after the completion of deadlines. Above all, the emerging issues of maintaining health and hygiene at worksite and living place and getting vaccinated are major challenges for the sustainability of the construction sector. Hence, a collective effort of the government, employers, and workers' organisations is the need of the hour."

The government of Rwanda has identified strategies to grow the dairy sector through strategic investment to achieve these goals. It is estimated two-thirds of lactating cows in Rwanda have clinical or subclinical mastitis, which reduces milk production and increases the risk of milk as a source for zoonotic disease if the milk is consumed undercooked or unpasteurized. This case study outlines the implementation of a One Health framework that integrates education, research, and outreach in Rwanda to improve food safety and food security, for the social, economic, and health benefit of Rwandans and their livestock. Twenty-five Rwandan Extension Specialists participated in the Dairy Dynamic Management education, research, and outreach program. Once trained, the extension specialists supported 30 small holder dairy farmers in performing proper husbandry and animal health practices for mastitis control and reduction of bacterial counts in the udder. Over the 16-week program, 30 small holder dairy farmers and 100 dairy cows were surveyed weekly for animal husbandry, animal health, and mastitis indicators. Outcomes were evaluated by monitoring animal health, foodborne pathogens in milk, and compliance to animal husbandry protocols. Quarter milk samples were collected weekly and evaluated for the presence of bacteria that are common causes of mastitis. We found a statistically significant reduction of mean total bacterial counts and prevalence of bacterial species in quarters over the 16-week training ("

Many of these substances have carcinogenic and genotoxic properties, and exposure to DBPs have been linked to adverse respiratory effects. The association between long-term exposure to a chlorinated swimming pool and elevated serum sIgE levels suggests a link between allergens, chlorine exposure and the development of various pulmonary dysfunctions. Thus, the combination of intense and repeated physical endurance training over extended periods, along with suboptimal environmental conditions, may contribute to the development of rhinitis, asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in athletes. While occasional or low-level exposure to chlorine might not be harmful, regular swimmers, especially those at competitive levels, are at a higher risk of developing respiratory disorders. Because these potential risks of exposure to CBDs must be balanced against the benefits of swimming and the risk of microbial infections in pools, we recommend better pool management and regular health checks for swimmers. Fortunately, the reduction of bronchial symptoms in swimmers who reduce training volume and intensity suggests that the negative effects on pulmonary function may be reversible. For these reasons, it is crucial to develop effective respiratory protection strategies, including medical interventions and modifications to the pool environment. Practical steps such as reducing chlorine use, ensuring proper hygiene before swimming and using swim caps can minimise risks. Research should also explore safer alternatives to CBDs, such as ozonation, and improved ventilation to reduce air pollutants."

The traditional approaches to teaching children about dental health may not be successful since they may not be able to keep their interest. Metaverse technology offers a promising alternative, allowing for the design of engaging and immersive worlds that can effectively educate children about oral health. Despite the growing interest in the use of metaverse technology in healthcare, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on its potential for oral health promotion in children. This review aims to fill this gap by providing an overview of the current state of metaverse-based oral health promotion for children, discussing its benefits and challenges, and highlighting its potential for improving children's oral health. By conducting this review, the authors hope to provide new information on the potential of metaverse-based oral health promotion for children and to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the use of metaverse technology in healthcare. This review may also provide valuable insights for dental organizations and practitioners interested in using metaverse technology to promote oral health and healthy living among children."

A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 394 athletes (316 combat athletes and 78 team athletes). Participants completed a 28-question survey assessing their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding mouthguard use, hygiene, and maintenance. The survey included questions on demographic data, mouthguard usage habits, cleaning methods, and storage practices. Combat sports athletes exhibited significantly higher rates of mouthguard use (100%) compared to team sports athletes (29.5%) (chi square [χ2] = 258.971, p<0.001). Significant differences were also found in cleaning (χ2 = 252.195, p<0.001) and storage practices (χ2 = 14.195, p = 0.002), with combat athletes demonstrating better adherence to recommended guidelines. Common complaints about mouthguards included difficulties with speaking (χ2 = 7.792, p = 0.005) and breathing (χ2 = 11.431, p = 0.001), with combat athletes reporting fewer issues. The study highlights the need for increased awareness and education on mouthguard use among team sports athletes. Dentists and coaches play a crucial role in promoting proper mouthguard use, hygiene, and maintenance to prevent sports-related dental injuries. Emphasis should be placed on the benefits of custom-made mouthguards for improved comfort and protection."

        "abstract": "Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles. The aim of this study is to explore the short- and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19-related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes. This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N=29; intervention VR training, n=15, vs control video-based instruction, n=14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use. Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=.03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the control group (median score of User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire 27/30, IQR 23-28, vs 22/30, IQR 20-24, in the control group; P=.01). VR simulation was at least as effective as traditional learning methods in training medical students while providing benefits regarding user satisfaction. These results add to the growing body of evidence that VR is a useful tool for acquiring simple and complex clinical skills."

The present study aims to assess the anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory efficacy of herbal toothpaste compared to synthetic toothpaste among 20-40-year-old patients in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. In this study, 130 subjects aged between 20 and 40 years with poor oral hygiene status and signs of gingival inflammation corresponding with chronic marginal gingivitis were selected. Subjects in Group 1 were prescribed herbal toothpaste (KUDOS Ayurveda), whereas patients in Group 2 were administered non-herbal toothpaste. Clinical parameters of gingival health specifically gingival index (GI), patient hygiene performance (PHP), and approximate plaque index (API) were recorded at baseline, 14 days, 28 days, and 42 days. Chi-square test, student-independent t-test, and paired t-test were performed to find significant differences in various variables between the two groups at different follow-up visits. At the end of the study, a significant reduction in GI and API scores was obtained, along with increased PHP scores. The p-value was set at 0.05, and the power of the study was set at 0.95. There was a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) in GI and API and an improvement in PHP scores at various time intervals in Group 1 as compared to Group 2.  Conclusion: Regular application of herbal extract dentifrices for 42 days provided a significant reduction of dental plaque and improvement in overall gingival health without any adverse effects. This instilled motivation in the patients to uphold proper oral hygiene. Hence, herbal dentifrices could be prescribed as an adjunct to periodontal therapy in the maintenance phase."

The aim of this study was to identify the most significant dental problems and limitations of daily oral hygiene in Polish patients with MS. 199 patients with diagnosed MS (median age 37 years) treated in the neurological outpatient clinic were interviewed using a paper-based questionnaire. They provided answers on oral health, behaviours and the limitations of their daily oral hygiene. Clinical information regarding symptoms, MS phenotype, relapses, medication and degrees of disability was based on medical records. The most frequent symptoms were dry mouth (43.2%) and bleeding from gums (28.1%). Dry mouth was more frequent in patients with secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) than relapsing-remitting MS (65.4% vs 41.3%, p = 0.023). Patients with bleeding from gums had had MS for a longer duration (median 6 vs 4 years, p = 0.002). Difficulties in daily oral hygiene were more frequent in patients with SPMS (24.0% vs 8.1%; p = 0.016). Greater proportions of patients with muscle weakness of limbs, imbalance or pain brushed their teeth irregularly. Frequent (i.e. at least every six months) visits to the dentist's surgery were uncommon in patients with SPMS (12.0% vs 39.7%, p = 0.010). Dry mouth and bleeding from gums are more frequent in patients with longer lasting and more advanced types of MS. Daily oral hygiene and oral health self-control is limited in patients with MS, mainly due to motor deficits, balance problems and pain, and this becomes worse with disease duration. To minimise the burden of the disease, patients with MS require better education and improvement in their awareness regarding proper oral health control, such as the use of electric toothbrushes. In addition, patients with chronic and progressive disability from multiple sclerosis may benefit from better organised access to dental care."

        "abstract": "The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused worldwide panic in the global population taking people's lives, creating fear, and affecting mother-child relationships. Many questions were raised on the dangers of being infected with COVID-19 for newborns and safety concerns during feeding by COVID-19-positive mothers. Moreover, questions and doubts about the safety of the administration of vaccinations for nursing mothers are still open. This review attempts to fill the existing literature gap by exploring concepts concerning COVID-19 and breastfeeding mothers, the safety of vaccinations, the beneficial effects of breastfeeding on both mother and child, important hygiene recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and possible solutions to optimize breastfeeding and safety precautions amidst the fear of emergence of novel variants. All relevant publications from Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus search engines from December 2019 to October 2022 related to SARS-CoV-2, breastfeeding, COVID-19, lactating guidelines, and vaccination were included using 'Breastfeeding AND vaccine AND SARS-CoV-2' as MESH TERMS. Apart from the literature review, existing maternity protocols followed in Northern UAE were gathered from lactation consultants practicing in the UAE. Out of 19,391 records generated, only 24 studies were analyzed and summarized in this exhaustive review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart. Previous studies suggest that breastmilk is predominantly the primary source of nutrition for neonates. Breast milk is a rich source of antibodies that help the baby to fight against infections including other benefits. Hygiene recommendations for suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected mothers are required along with psychological and emotional support. The administration of vaccinations should be advised and encouraged to protect the mothers with antibodies and the neonates by the passive transmission of antibodies through breast milk. This is a significant reason for not stopping breastfeeding even in case of COVID-19 infection. With adherence to proper hygiene methods, breastfeeding is recommended to be continued as the benefits greatly outweigh the risks."

Such data are characterised by complex inter- and intra-outcome relationships which must be accounted for during analysis. Scientific questions of interest might include determining the effect of a treatment on the evolution of all outcomes together, or grouping outcomes that change in the same way. Modelling the different outcomes separately may not be appropriate because it ignores the underlying relationships between outcomes. In such situations, a joint modelling strategy is necessary. This paper describes a pairwise joint modelling approach and discusses its benefits over more simple statistical analysis approaches, with application to data from a study of the response to BCG vaccination in the first year of life, conducted in Entebbe, Uganda. The study aimed to determine the effect of maternal latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI) on infant immune response (TNF, IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-2 responses to PPD), following immunisation with BCG. A simple analysis ignoring the correlation structure of multivariate longitudinal data is first shown. Univariate linear mixed models are then used to describe longitudinal profiles of each outcome, and are then combined into a multivariate mixed model, specifying a joint distribution for the random effects to account for correlations between the multiple outcomes. A pairwise joint modelling approach, where all possible pairs of bivariate mixed models are fitted, is then used to obtain parameter estimates. Univariate and pairwise longitudinal analysis approaches are consistent in finding that LTBI had no impact on the evolution of cytokine responses to PPD. Estimates from the pairwise joint modelling approach were more precise. Major advantages of the pairwise approach include the opportunity to test for the effect of LTBI on the joint evolution of all, or groups of, outcomes and the ability to estimate association structures of the outcomes. The pairwise joint modelling approach reduces the complexity of analysis of high-dimensional multivariate repeated measures, allows for proper accounting for association structures and can improve our understanding and interpretation of longitudinal immuno-epidemiological data."

Family members of individuals with dependent drinking are often their primary caregivers and play a key role in decisions around help-seeking, treatment and recovery. The nature and role of stigma in caregiving, and the consequent burden on family caregivers of those with dependent drinking, has not been qualitatively studied in India. We conducted in-depth interviews with: (i) men with probable alcohol dependence (n = 11); (ii) family caregivers (n = 12); and (iii) doctors with experience of treating alcohol dependence (n = 13) in community settings in Goa. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Two primary themes were identified from the data: (i) stigma in the form of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination; and (ii) the impact of this stigma on caregiving decisions and the mental health of caregivers. We found that stigma functioned as a barrier to a proper course of treatment and care, as well as a detrimental factor for caregiver's mental health and caregiving decision-making. Stigma towards dependent drinking in the forms of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination is prevalent within homes, workplaces and health systems and might exacerbate the caregiving burden among female family caregivers. Policies, educational programs and campaigns aimed at preventing stigma in these forms would likely enable access to more inclusive and appropriate health services, benefit the health of family caregivers and improve the treatment outcomes of drinkers."

To determine the best possible method of diagnosis for Gonococcus infection in resource-limited settings. The meta-analyses were designed to determine the difference in diagnosis between Culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and also between the different Amplification Tests and widely available Roche COBAS AMPLICOR test. Databases searched were Pubmed, Medline, Google Scholar and Cochrane reviews. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals was estimated for the dichotomous outcomes. The random-effect model was applied for all the studies in the analysis. The meta-analysis was computed in RevMan Version 5.3, Copenhagen, Denmark. In the first analysis, NAATs significantly improved the chances of detection in comparison to the standard culture and final RR was 1.24 (1.05-2.51), which put the diamond on the right of no-effect axis, indicating more positives by NAATs. In the second analysis, AMPLICOR had the more positive results, which may have indicated better detection rate, as well as less specificity and final RR was 0.809 (0.737-0.888), which put the diamond on the left of the non-effect axis, indicating more positives by AMPLICOR. In a resource-limited scenario like India, the syndromic management of STIs are considered to be the norm. A positive diagnosis is only given if the tests are confirmed by Culture, as it is still considered to be the gold standard of diagnosis. However, in many cases, due to suboptimal transportation and lack of proper handling, culture in unable to grow even if the patient is infected. In such cases, Nucleic Acid Tests should be able to detect an infection."

To better understand users, needs and inform peri-urban sanitation policy, our study used multivariate stepwise logistic regression to assess the factors associated with use of improved (toilet) and unimproved (chamber) sanitation facilities among peri-urban residents. We analysed data from 205 household heads in 1 peri-urban settlement of Lusaka, Zambia on socio-demographics (economic status, education level, marital status, etc.), household sanitation characteristics (toilet facility, ownership and management) and household diarrhoea prevalence. Household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities were assessed based on WHO-UNICEF criteria. Of particular interest was the simultaneous use of toilet facilities and chambers, an alternative form of unimproved sanitation with focus towards all-in-one suitable alternatives. Findings revealed that having a regular income, private toilet facility, improved drinking water and handwashing facility were all positively correlated to having an improved toilet facility. Interestingly, both improved toilets and chambers indicated increased odds for diarrhoea prevalence. Odds of chamber usage were also higher for females and users of unimproved toilet facilities. Moreover, when toilets were owned by residents, and hygiene was managed externally, use of chambers was more likely. Findings finally revealed higher diarrhoea prevalence for toilets with more users. Results highlight the need for a holistic, simultaneous approach to WASH for overall success in sanitation. To better access and increase peri-urban sanitation, this study recommends a separate sanitation ladder for high density areas which considers improved private and shared facilities, toilet management and all-inclusive usage (cancelling unimproved alternatives). It further calls for financial plans supporting urban poor access to basic sanitation and increased education on toilet facility models, hygiene, management and risk to help with choice and proper facility use to maximize toilet use benefit."

Proper WASH practices can decrease risk of stunting, wasting, and disease in children under the age of 2. The purpose of our study is to examine if using technology to access health information and services among Indonesian women affects knowledge and behaviors regarding handwashing and defecation practices. Our study is an interview-based cross-sectional survey. Participants included 1734 mothers of children under 2 years of age. These women were randomly selected and interviewed as part of a 3-stage cluster sampling technique. Our study uses data regarding WASH knowledge which includes benefits of handwashing with soap, 5 critical times of handwashing, risks of open defecation, media of disease transmission, defecation locations, and risks of open defecation. Data regarding WASH behaviors were also included: handwashing with soap, type of latrine used at home, and where defecation took place. This investigation used adjusted and unadjusted logistic and linear regression models to determine differences in WASH outcomes between those who use technology to access health information and services and those who did not. One result is that Indonesian women with children under 2 years of age who use technology to access health information and services are more likely to know the advantages of proper handwashing (odds ratio [OR] 2.603, 95% CI 1.666-4.067) and know the 5 critical times of handwashing (OR 1.217, 95% CI 0.969-1.528). Women who use technology to access health information are also more likely to know the risks of open defecation (OR 1.627, 95% CI 1.170-2.264) and use a type of toilet (such as a gooseneck or squat toilet) that limits risk (OR 3.858, 95% CI 2.628-5.665) compared to women who did not use technology to access health information. Using technology to access health information and services was associated with an increase in handwashing and defecation knowledge. In the future, promoting mothers of children under 2 years of age to access health information through technology might be used to increase handwashing and defecation knowledge as well as safe defecation practices. However, further research should be done to determine how technology may increase the frequency of recommended handwashing behaviors."

We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection. Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable. Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing."

Tele-ICARs are used to gauge different IPC measures specific to SARS-CoV-2 and are either proactive--conducted prior to identified cases--or responsive to an outbreak, which is defined as a new SARS-CoV-2 infection in any staff or any facility-onset infection in a resident. State and local partners use findings from the assessments to aid LTCFs by providing targeted and timely resources and support to mitigate identified gaps. Data from tele-ICARs conducted between March 1 and October 30, 2020 were analyzed to assess major gaps across LTCF types. A major gap was defined as 10% or more of facilities not satisfying a specific IPC measure, excluding missing data. Gaps were also assessed by tele-ICAR type: proactive or responsive. Fisher's exact tests and univariate logistic regression were used to characterize significant associations between major IPC gaps and LTCF or tele-ICAR type. DSHS conducted tele-ICARs in 438 LTCFs in Texas during 8 months; 191 were nursing homes/skilled nursing facilities (NH/SNFs), 206 were assisted living facilities (ALFs) and 41 were other settings. Of the assessments, 264 were proactive and 174 responsive. Major gaps identified were: (1) 22% did not have a preference for alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) over soap and water; (2) 18.1% were not aware of the contact time for disinfectants in use; (3) 17.9% had not stopped resident communal dining; (4) 16.8% did not audit hand hygiene and PPE compliance; and (5) 11.8% had not stopped inter-facility group activities and extra-facility field trips. When restricting analyses to proactive tele-ICARs, one additional gap was identified: 11.1% of facilities lacked a dedicated space to care for or cohort residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significantly more ALFs than NH/SNFs had not suspended resident communal dining (P < .001) nor identified a dedicated space to cohort residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (P < .001). Significantly more LTCFs that received a responsive ICAR compared to a proactive ICAR reported a preference for ABHS over soap and water (P = .008) and reported suspending communal dining (P < .001) and group activities (P < .001). Also, significantly more LTCFs that received a responsive ICAR compared to a proactive ICAR had identified a dedicated space to cohort residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (P = .009). Increased facility education and awareness of federal and state guidelines for group activities and communal dining is warranted in Texas, emphasizing the importance of social distancing for preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs, particularly ALFs. CDC recommendations for ABHS versus hand washing should be emphasized, as well as the importance of monitoring and auditing HCP hand hygiene and PPE compliance. Facilities may benefit from additional education and resources about disinfection, to ensure proper selection of disinfectants and understanding of the contact time required for efficacy. Analysis by tele-ICAR type suggests facilities may benefit from identifying space for dedicated COVID-19 units in advance of an outbreak in their facility. Conducting tele-ICARs in LTCFs enables public health agencies to provide direct and individualized feedback to facilities and identify state-wide opportunities for effective interventions in response to SARS-CoV-2."

Poor oral hygiene may lead to dental caries and periodontal disease and also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with stroke have a possibility of recurrence, and good oral health is expected to benefit their general health. Nevertheless, nursing research exploring the oral health and oral hygiene behaviors of stroke patients has been rare. To explore the factors significantly associated with oral health status and oral hygiene behaviors in patients with stroke. A cross-sectional research design with convenient sampling was used. Information on health promoting behaviors and oral health status was collected in a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. A multivariate linear regression model was applied to explore the factors associated with oral health status in patients with stroke. One hundred and eight-five patients with stroke were enrolled in this study. The average number of real teeth was 11.3 and the average score for oral health status was 4. The univariate analysis showed that being 65 years of age or older, having an education level below primary school, having a lower Barthel index score, having a higher modified Rankin scale score, not brushing and flossing, not having a regular tooth cleaning, having a lower of health promotion score, and having insufficient water intake levels were all associated with a worse oral health status. The stepwise regression analysis showed that factors affecting oral health status include health promotion behaviors, age, tooth brushing, and water intake, which, together, accounted for 28.5% of the total variance. The findings indicate that oral health status, oral hygiene behaviors, and health promoting behaviors are inadequate among patients with stroke. Clinicians should promote health-related behaviors early to their patients with stroke, specifically in terms of implementing proper oral hygiene behaviors in daily routine care. 腦中風病人之口腔健康狀態與口腔衛生行為及其影響因素. 口腔健康與全身疾病有密切關係，口腔衛生不佳易導致齲齒及牙周病，亦會增加心血管疾病的風險。腦中風病人可能會再復發，好的口腔健康將有助於中風病人的整體健康狀態，但是探討中風族群的口腔健康及口腔衛生行為，護理研究仍然不足。. 探討腦中風病人之口腔健康狀態與口腔衛生行為及其影響因素。. 採橫斷式研究設計，以方便取樣自南部某教學醫院門診腦中風之個案，收集人口學資料、健康促進行為、口腔衛生行為、口腔健康狀態，並以逐步迴歸分析影響中風病人口腔健康狀態之因素。. 共有185位個案參與本計畫，真牙顆數為11.3，口腔健康狀態4分。年齡65歲以上、國小教育以下、巴氏量表得分越低、整體功能狀態越差、無刷牙與使用牙線、無定期洗牙、健康促進得分越低者及水分攝取不足，其口腔健康狀態得分越差。經逐步迴歸分析顯示健康促進行為得分、年齡、刷牙次數及水分攝取對口腔健康狀態可解釋總變異量約28.5%。. 研究結果顯示參與本研究的中風病人，其口腔健康狀態、口腔衛生行為及健康促進行為相當不理想。建議臨床照護應及早推動健康促進行為，尤其應將口腔衛生落實於日常照護中。."

Noninvasive treatment options are the first line of treatment. It would be beneficial to know when the bladder reaches its maximum capacity, to enable to prompt going to the bathroom on time and thereby potentially prevent an UI event. Recently, a wearable bladder sensor was developed, the TENA SmartCare Bladder Sensor (Bladder Sensor), which is intended to support children ( ≥ 6 years) and adults (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m Adults ( ≥ 18 years) suffering from UI during day and/or night tested the Bladder Sensor independently at home for 1 week. Device performance, safety, usability, user satisfaction and self-reported disease specific information, and QoL were assessed at pre-defined times. Intra-individual results were compared. Any episodes of urination and/or urine loss were documented by subjects in a paper diary. Raw data of the Bladder Sensor was analyzed to evaluate the bladder detection rate and full bladder notification rate(s). 30 adults (female/male: 67%/33%; median age: 53 years (Interquartile range (IQR) 32-61 years); median BMI of 22.6 kg/m It was demonstrated that the Bladder Sensor can detect the bladder under real-life conditions among its intended users and can support in the prevention of UI. This seemed dependent on anatomical limitations (e.g., BMI and body shape), bladder volume (low bladder detection rate < 100 mL), and/or proper fixation. The device had a positive effect on the subject's urinary incontinence, their Qo,L and overall well-being while testing it for 1 week. It is assumed that this effect will be strengthened when users incorporate the use of the device into their daily life. Long-term benefits of the Bladder Sensor as an adjunct tool in continence care management needs to be investigated. Registration number is NL81246.000.22."

Understanding nurses' experiences and perceptions when working night shift will facilitate the development of strategies to minimize the potential negative effects of working at night. In examining nurses' experiences and perceptions of working night shift, there is scope to explore how to improve night shift nurses' practice environment and job satisfaction, which will then translate to improved nurse and patient outcomes. This review included qualitative studies focused on the experiences and perceptions of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who work the night shift or rotate between day and night shift. This review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. The methodology used was consistent with the a priori protocol. Studies included in this review were those published in full text, English, and between 1983 (when the seminal work on hospitals that attract and retain nurses was published) and February 2021, when the search was completed. The main databases searched for published and unpublished studies included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.From the search, two reviewers independently screened the studies against the inclusion criteria, and then papers selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative data were extracted from the included papers independently by the four reviewers. Results from each reviewer were discussed and clarified to reach agreement. The extracted findings were pooled and examined for shared meaning, coded, and grouped into categories. Common categories were grouped into meta-synthesis to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings were graded using the ConQual approach to determine the level of confidence (trust) users may have in the value of the synthesized findings. Thirty-four papers, representing 33 studies, met the criteria for inclusion. The studies were conducted in 11 countries across six continents, with a total of 601 participants. From these, a total of 220 findings were extracted and combined to form 11 categories based on similarity in meaning, and three syntheses were derived: i) The \"Other\" Shift: the distinctiveness of night nursing; ii) Juggling sleep and all aspects of life when working nights; and iii) Existing in the Twilight Zone: battling the negative impact of sleep deprivation consumes nurses who strive to keep patients, self, and others safe. The major conclusions from this review are the uniqueness of working the night shift and the sleep deprivation of night nurses. Organizational strategies and support are needed for those working this shift, which will enhance nurse and patient safety. PROSPERO CRD42019135294."

        "abstract": "During the past decade, vision problems that were attributed to the use of electronic screens have gradually shifted from being a workplace health issue to a wider public health issue. \"Computer vision syndrome\" originally related to the few professionals exposed to long hours of work in front of a computer screen. The widespread use of digital screens in devices used throughout the day have led to the emergence of \"digital eye strain\" as a new clinical syndrome that affects every individual who spends a large period of time fixated on multiple screens, for work or leisure. A new subcategory, \"video game vision\" has been proposed to specifically address vision issues related to large periods of continuous use of screen enabled devices in order to play video games. With gaming disorder being included in the next version of the WHO classification of diseases (ICD-11), it is becoming increasingly important to have a clear idea of the impact of this disorder in general health and functioning. At the same time, a number of research studies have reported positive impact of videogame playing on the players vision. This article reviews the latest research studies on the impact of digital screen enabled devices on adolescent vision in light of the increasing reports of internet addiction and gaming disorder while referencing positive findings of videogaming on vision in order to provide a balanced approach and assist with classification, diagnosis and treatment, while providing directions for future research."

This cross-sectional study is a retrospective longitudinal analyses of the Seattle Longitudinal Study (SLS), which evaluated self-reported sleep duration (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in older adults. Participants within the SLS were enrolled as part of a community-based cohort from the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound and Health Maintenance Organization of Washington between 1956 and 2020. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to May 2023. The main outcome for this study was cognitive impairment, as defined by subthreshold performance on both the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Sleep duration was defined by self-report of median nightly sleep duration over the last week and was assessed longitudinally over multiple time points. Median sleep duration, sleep phenotype (short sleep, median ≤7 hours; medium sleep, median = 7 hour; long sleep, median ≥7 hours), change in sleep duration (slope), and variability in sleep duration (SD of median sleep duration, or sleep variability) were evaluated. Of the participants enrolled in SLS, only 1104 participants who were administered both the Health Behavior Questionnaire and the neuropsychologic battery were included for analysis in this study. A total of 826 individuals (mean [SD] age, 76.3 [11.8] years; 468 women [56.7%]; 217 apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriers [26.3%]) had complete demographic information and were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model (concordance, 0.76) showed that status as a short sleeper (hazard ratio, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.59-8.50) and higher sleep variability (hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.14-5.49) were significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. In this community-based longitudinal study of the association between sleep patterns and cognitive performance, the short sleep phenotype was significantly associated with impaired cognitive performance. Furthermore, high sleep variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment, highlighting the possibility that instability in sleep duration over long periods of time may impact cognitive decline in older adults."

To bridge this gap in the literature, I conducted a dynamic longitudinal analysis to investigate the association between long working hours and the risk of mental illness nationwide. Using three-wave longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies conducted in 2014, 2016, and 2018, I adopted dynamic regression models with lagged long working hours variables to examine their association with the risk of mental illness. The results indicate that long working hours have positive and significant (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) associations with the risk of mental illness (OR: 1.12~1.22). The effect is more significant for women, white-collar workers, and employees in micro-firms, compared with their counterparts (i.e., men, pink- and blue-collar workers, employees of large firms, and self-employed individuals). The results provide empirical evidence of the effects of long working hours on mental health in China, confirming the need to enforce the regulations regarding standard working hours and monitor regulatory compliance by companies, as these factors are expected to improve mental health."

Additionally, the definition of long working hours varies slightly due to country differences in working hours systems. Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between long working hours and the self-rated health (SRH) level, taking into account gender and educational differences. Data were collected from two waves (2016 and 2018) of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). A total of 6972 workers were available for analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis, an ordered probit (oprobit) model and conditional mixed process (CMP) regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Furthermore, I conducted a stratified analysis by gender and education groups. This study observed a negative association between long working hours and SRH. Compared to other education groups, labor with long working hours had a more negative impact on the SRH of those with higher education. Long working hours had a more negative influence on the SRH of male workers. In contrast, no clear association was found among female workers. This study estimates SRH of those with long working hours in China. Among workers, long working hours have a negative impact on the health of workers with college degrees or beyond. One possible explanation is that they do not exercise, their diet is unreasonable, and their working conditions involve chronic exposure to computer radiation. The negative health effects of long working hours on males are four times greater than those on females. This study provides valuable insights into the health of the workforce, working time regulations and overtime rules."

These include needlestick injuries and motor vehicle accidents, and other impacts on practitioner health, ranging from cancer, mental health problems, metabolic disorders to coronary disease. Other 24-hour safety-critical industries have fatigue policies that acknowledge the risks of staff fatigue and provide a system to manage it and mitigate harm, but these are still lacking within healthcare.

In this regard, circadian rhythm misalignment induced by exposure to night work or long working hours would be responsible for cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, evidence supporting this correlation is limited and several issues still need to be elucidated. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between shift/night work and cognitive impairment and address its main determinants. Information provided by the reviewed studies suggested that night work might have serious immediate negative effects especially on cognitive domains related to attention, memory and response inhibition. Furthermore, cognitive performance would progressively worsen over consecutive night shifts or following exposure to very long work shifts. Otherwise, conflicting results emerged regarding the possible etiological role that night work chronic exposure would have on cognitive impairment. Therefore, circadian rhythm desynchronization, lack of sleep and fatigue resulting from night work may negatively impact worker's cognitive efficiency. However, in light of the considerable methodological variability of the reviewed studies, we proposed to develop a standardized research and evaluation strategy in order to obtain a better and comprehensive understanding of this topic."

We used the Korea Health Panel (2009, 2011-2014) involving 20,451 person-wave observations from 5567 individuals. Perceived unmet dental care needs was defined when the participants reported that they perceived a need for dental treatment or check-up but had failed to receive dental care services during the past year. Fixed effects logit models were applied to examine how changes in weekly working hours or shift work status were linked to changes in perceived unmet dental needs within each individual. Among participants, 15.9-24.7% reported perceived unmet dental needs and the most common reason was time scarcity. We found that long working hours (>52 h/week) was significantly associated with perceived unmet dental needs due to time scarcity in both men (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.78) and women (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.79) compared workers working 40-52 h per week. Shift work was also a significant risk factor, but only in women (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.32).

Components of metabolic syndrome were measured in periodic health examinations before the intervention, 6-9 months after, and 1.5-2 years after the intervention. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate changes in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Analyses were stratified by day work versus shift work. The results showed a significantly decreased prevalence of metabolic syndrome 6-9 months following the intervention in day workers (risk ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.88), but the benefit disappeared after 1.5-2 years. Shift workers showed a decreased prevalence of metabolic syndrome for the whole follow-up duration after the intervention, although the change was not statistically significant. Reducing working hours was associated with short-term improvement in metabolic syndrome in male manual workers."

However, there is no clear evidence for a direct link between mental health and long working hours in the young adult populations. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether long working hours are associated with mental health in young adult workers. Data were collected from a 2012 follow-up survey of the Youth Panel 2007. A total of 3,332 young adult employees (aged 20 to 35) were enrolled in the study. We analyzed stress, depression, and suicidal thoughts by multivariate logistic regression analysis based on working hours (41 to 50, 51 to 60 and over 60 hours, compared to 31 to 40 hours per week), which was adjusted for sex, age, marriage status, region, and educational level. From the 3,332 young adult employees, about 60% of the workers worked more than 40 hours and 17% of the workers worked more than 50 hours per week. In a Chi-square test, stress level, depression, and suicidal thoughts increased with increasing working hours (p-value <0.001, 0.007, and 0.018, respectively). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that, compared to the 31 to 40 hours per week group, the adjusted odds ratios of the 41 to 50, 51 to 60, and over 60 hours per week groups for stress were 1.46(1.23-1.74), 2.25(1.79-2.83) and 2.55(1.72-3.77), respectively. A similar trend was shown in depression [odds ratios: 2.08(1.23-3.53), 2.79(1.44-5.39) and 4.09(1.59-10.55), respectively] and suicidal ideation [odds ratios: 1.98(0.95-4.10), 3.48(1.48-8.19) and 5.30(1.61-17.42), respectively]. We concluded that long working hours were associated with stress, depression, and suicidal ideation in young employees, aged 20 to 35."

Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were used to evaluate declines in K-MMSE scores over the 12-year study period. Overall HR (95% CI) for a decline in cognitive function in long working hours group was 1.13 (0.73-1.17). When categorized by sex, women with long working hours had an HR (95% CI) of 1.50 (1.05-2.22), K-MMSE scores decreased significantly after working long hours for 5 years (p < 0.01). The study furthers understanding of the effects of long working hours on cognitive decline among female workers. Further research is required to determine the effects of long working hours on cognitive functions."

        "abstract": "Long working hours are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, yet the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. The study examines how occupational factors like working hours, shift work, and employment status correlate with dietary choices and sodium intake, impacting hypertension risk. This study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2013 and 2020. The dataset included 8,471 respondents, all of whom were wage workers aged 20 or older and reported working at least 36 hours per week. Individuals who have been previously diagnosed with or are currently diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia were excluded. The average daily sodium intake was assessed via a 24-hour dietary recall method. Average weekly working hours were categorized into 3 groups: 36-40 hours, 41-52 hours, and over 52 hours. Multiple logistic regression models were used. Study findings revealed that 83.7% of participants exceeded the recommended daily sodium intake of 2 g set by the World Health Organization. After adjusting for confounding factors, a positive correlation was observed between average working hours and daily sodium intake. Among males, statistical significance was found in the group with average weekly working hours of 41-52 hours (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.30) and the group exceeding 52 hours (PR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.09-1.38) when comparing the fourth quartile of daily sodium intake to the combined quartiles of Q1, Q2, and Q3. Among females, no significance was noted. Long working hours were associated with increased sodium intake, primarily among male workers. This connection is likely attributed to having less time for home-cooked meals, resulting in higher fast food consumption and dining out. A workplace intervention promoting healthy eating and reducing stress is essential to lower sodium consumption and mitigate hypertension risk."

This is a cross-sectional study conducted among migrant construction workers working in Chennai comprised of 1,521 participants. The sleep quality was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Scale-7 and the working hours was found using the Google forms and their oral health status was assessed using the Oral hygiene index- Simplified (OHIS-S) and the Decayed Missing and Filled teeth (DMFT) index. The data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistical Software version 23.0. Statistical tests like the Chi-square association and one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (normally distributed) were used for the analysis of three group comparisons. From the study results, most of the participants were between 25 and 35 years, smokers, had negligence on oral health and had poor sleep quality due to their long working hours. On the association between the working hours per week and OHIS, DMFT and Insomnia Severity Scale total score, a statistically significant relationship was found using the one-way ANOVA. The results from our study brought neglected oral health care of the construction workers into the limelight which will help us in our future efforts to improve the oral health of the construction workers."

We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science databases through August 2021. A random-effect model was used to assess the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and regression coefficients (β) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by the Egger's tests. Twenty-two observational studies were included with a total of 191,420 participants. Compared with children whose mothers worked less than 35 h/week, we found that children whose mothers worked more than 35 to 40 h/week had a 2.24-fold increased risk of childhood overweight/obesity (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.61-3.11). An increment of 10 h/week in maternal working was associated with an approximately 1.0 percentage points in the probability of childhood overweight/obesity (β = 0.008, 95% CI: 0.004-0.012). The pooled OR also indicated a similar result (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15). In addition, an increment of 10 h/week in maternal working was associated with 0.029 units increase in offspring's BMI z score (β = 0.029, 95% CI: 0.016-0.042). Maternal long working hours is a potential risk factor for offspring's weight-related outcomes. Measures should be taken to protect the work welfare of females, thus facilitating the positive interaction of individual-family-society."

We analysed data from the Korean Labour & Income Panel Study spanning 2018 to 2022, including 8,954 to 10,079 wage workers annually. Weekly working hours and SRH were the primary variables, with equivalized household income levels classified into quartiles. A generalised estimating equation was used to assess the relationship between long working hours and poor SRH, adjusted for demographic and health-related factors. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on household income level and satisfaction. Long working hours were generally associated with poor SRH (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) in unadjusted model, particularly among higher-income groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.01 for Q4) after adjustment for covariates. However, no significant association was found for lower-income groups. When stratified by income satisfaction, longer working hours were significantly associated with poor SRH only in income-satisfied individuals among higher-income group. The health effects of long working hours may differ according to household income levels and satisfaction. Policy interventions should consider both work hour reductions and income adequacy to improve worker health."

While for some sectors, such as emergency services, around-the-clock work is a necessary and critical societal obligation, work outside of traditional daytime schedules has been associated with many occupational safety and health hazards and their associated costs. Thus, organizational- and policy-level decisions on nonstandard work hours can be difficult and are based on several factors including economic evaluation. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge of economic benefits and costs associated with these schedules. We conducted a scoping review of the methodology and data used to examine the economic benefits and costs of nonstandard work hours and related interventions to mitigate risks. Ten studies met all our inclusion criteria. Most studies used aggregation and analysis of national and other large datasets. Costs estimated include health-related expenses, productivity losses, and projections of future loss of earnings. Cost analyses of interventions were provided for an obstructive sleep apnea screening program, implementation of an employer-based educational program, and increased staffing to cover overtime hours. A paucity of studies assess nonstandard work hours using economic terms. Future studies are needed to expand economic evaluations beyond the employer level to include those at the societal level because impacts of nonstandard work go beyond the workplace and are important for policy analysis and formulation. We pose the opportunity for researchers and employers to share data and resources in the development of more analyses that fill these research gaps."

Disinformation, stigma, ongoing isolation, and disruption of daily activities are all quite prevalent. Any of these elements may impact one's mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken several steps to address COVID's mental health concerns. In addition to frontline healthcare personnel, who engage in dealing with COVID-19, the general population's mental health was also at stake due to the unprecedented and catastrophic emergency of COVID. Various keywords, including MeSH terms, were used in PubMed and Google Scholar searches. This paper was based on previously available data and article searches on how COVID-19 affected the mental health of the general population and the elements that may influence it. Quarantine and self-isolation have been found to have affected people's daily livelihoods and behaviors, leading to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, dejection, insomnia, risky alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Many of the victims of COVID-19 who were critical survivors exhibited lasting psychological harm a year after being discharged, including high anxiety levels, melancholy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Healthcare employees too experienced significant psychological consequences due to factors such as an excessive workload or the number of hours worked, inadequate personal safety equipment, overly enthusiastic media coverage, and a sense of being under-supported. As a result of this major disaster, mental health concerns have surfaced, perhaps leading to long-term health problems, loneliness, and guilt. To reduce this deportment, global health solutions should be used, particularly while executing the isolation/quarantine and dealing with the people with fear and vulnerability. The mental health of the general population should be at the forefront of any worldwide response."

        "abstract": "Neoliberal globalization contributes to the out-migration of labour from sending countries in the global South. Supported by multilateral organizations including the IMF and World Bank, the migration and development nexus holds that nations and households in migrant sending countries can migrate their way out of poverty. Two countries that embrace this paradigm, the Philippines and Indonesia, are major suppliers of migrant labour including domestic workers, and Malaysia is a primary destination country. We deployed a multi-scalar and intersectional lens to highlight the impact of global forces and policies, interacting with constructions of gender and national identity, to explore the health and wellbeing of migrant domestic workers in Malaysia. In addition to documentary analysis, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 30 Indonesian and 24 Filipino migrant domestic workers, five representatives from civil society organizations, three government representatives, and four individuals engaged in labour brokerage and the health screening of migrant workers in Kuala Lumpur. Migrant domestic workers in Malaysia work long hours in private homes and are not protected by labour laws. Workers were generally satisfied with their access to health services; however, their intersectional status, which is both an outcome of, and contextualized by, the lack of opportunities in their own country, prolonged familial separation, low wages, and lack of control in the workplace, contributed to stress and related disorders-which we regard as the embodied manifestation of their migratory experiences. Migrant domestic workers eased these ill effects through self-care, spiritual practices, and the embrace of gendered values of self-sacrifice for the family as a form of solace. Structural inequities and the mobilization of gendered values of self-abnegation underpin the migration of domestic workers as a development strategy. While individual self-care practices were used to cope with the hardships of their work and family separation, these efforts did not remedy the harms nor redress structural inequities wrought by neoliberal globalization. Improvements in the long-term health and wellbeing of Indonesian and Filipino migrant domestic workers in Malaysia cannot focus solely on the preparation and maintenance of healthy bodies for productive labour, but must attend to workers' attainment of adequate social determinants of health, which challenges the migration as development paradigm. Neo-liberal policy instruments such as privatization, marketisation and commercialization of migrant labour have led to both host and home countries benefitting, but at the expense of the migrant domestic workers' well-being."

Work-related stress among nurses is recognized as an antecedent of burnout, which in turn impacts resiliency and well-being. The work of nursing has long been noted as stressful. Although nurse resilience and perceived well-being have been shown to decrease during a period of usual stress (constant and chronic), the impact and significance of prolonged stress on nurse resilience and well-being illuminates throughout the literature. Replicating a cross-sectional prepandemic study, nurses were resurveyed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both studies, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and PROMIS Global Health was used to measure respondent's: 1) resilience level; 2) physical health status; and 3) mental health status, respectively. Independent 2-sample t tests were performed to compare the pre-and-post score differences in the 3 outcomes. To identify characteristics that were associated with the pre-and-post differences, comparison analyses were also performed within each level of the respondents' characteristic variables. A higher proportion of postsurvey respondents reported working more than 8 hours of overtime per week, had thoughts of quitting their current job, and thought their workload was too much compared with the presurvey respondents. Generally, the postgroup resilience scores and self-perceived physical and mental scores were statistically significantly lower compared with the pregroup scores, but those differences were only observed in certain subgroups defined by respondents' characteristics. Self-perceived physical and mental health are significantly associated with the degree of resilience and worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in younger and older nurse cohorts. Engaged nurse leaders are key to implement interventions that build resilience and perceived well-being during periods of usual and prolonged stress."

We assessed the variations in the effects of long working hours on mental health across different groups. The results show that first, individuals working longer hours (55 h or more per week) exhibited a higher likelihood of developing mental illness than those working regular hours or fewer hours. Second, the negative effect of long working hours on mental health is more pronounced among non-regular workers than among regular workers. Third, the effect of long working hours on mental health varies among different demographic groups, with a greater impact observed among women, managers, non-regular workers, employees in small- or large-sized firms, and those in smaller cities compared to their counterparts. Thus, to enhance worker productivity, the Japanese government should address the issue of long working hours to improve employees' mental well-being. Initiatives aimed at promoting work-life balance, family-friendly policies, and measures to ameliorate working conditions are expected to help mitigate the challenges associated with long working hours and mental health issues, especially among non-regular workers."

Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). We used the Arksey O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author's country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (≥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (≥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs."

We estimate the long-term effects of parental income from birth to age 18 on health and risky health behaviors in adulthood. We use over 4 decades of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, from 1968 to 2017, to construct a unique data set that links 49,459 person-year outcomes in adulthood, to several parental and family level variables when they were born and throughout their childhood. To mitigate concerns that parental income is likely correlated with unobserved factors that determine children's outcomes in adulthood, we estimate an instrumental variables model. We construct a simulated income variable that is used to instrument for parental income. This approach breaks the link between an individual's own parental income and unobserved characteristics that are possibly correlated with their health in the long run. We find that a $10,000 increase in annual parental income increases the likelihood of very good or excellent health in adulthood by 3.7%, reduces the likelihood of physical limitation by 10.3%, and reduces the likelihood of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day by 12.7% and 16.7%, respectively. We also find that the pathways by which income improves health are increased education, employment, annual hours worked, pre-tax hourly earnings and pre-tax annual earnings. Our results highlight the lasting impact of economic resources in childhood and the importance of growing up in a financially stable environment."

This study examined the association between the working hours and parenting behavior of fathers while accounting for other factors related to their parenting behavior, using data from the Japan Environment and Children Study (JECS), a large cohort study in Japan. Data from 43,159 father-mother pairs were analyzed. The mother assessed the father's frequency of seven parenting behaviors at 6 months after delivery. Then, each behavior was classified into a high-engagement group (always and sometimes) or a low-engagement group (rarely and never). The father's weekly working hours was obtained from his responses and was classified into six levels. Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for covariates, fathers' weekly working hours was inversely associated with the frequency of all parenting behaviors examined in this study ( This study suggests that the greater time constraints imposed by longer working hours constitute a major factor that discourages fathers from engaging in childrearing behavior. Intervention targeting long working hours could contribute to measures aimed at promoting high-engagement parenting behaviors among fathers."

        "abstract": "Truck driving is one of the most common male occupations worldwide. Drivers endure long working hours, isolation, separation from family, compromised sleep, and face rigid regulatory requirements. Studies have documented the work factors contributing to poor health outcomes, however these have not been explored in the Australian context. The aim of this grounded theory study was to explore the impact of work and coping factors on mental health of Australian truck drivers from their perspective. Recruitment used a purposive snowball sampling, through social media campaigns and direct email invites. Interview data were collected via phone/teleconference, audio recorded and typed verbatim. Inductive coding and thematic analysis were completed with triangulation of themes. Seventeen interviews were completed (94% male). Six themes arose, two supporting (Connections; Coping methods), and four disrupting mental health (Compromised supports; Unrealistic demands; Financial pressures; Lack of respect). Drivers had concerns regarding the many things beyond their control and the interactions of themes impacting their health even further. This study explored the impact of work and coping factors affecting truck driver mental health in Australia. Themes described the importance of connections and coping methods drivers had to support their health. Many factors that compromised their health were often outside their control. These results highlight the need for a multi-faceted collaboration between stakeholders; the driver, employing companies, policy makers/regulators and the public to address the negative impact of truck driving on mental health."

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of lasting COVID-19 symptoms or disability on the working population upon their return to employment. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statements we performed a systematic review in December 2021, screening three databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus), for articles investigating return to work in patients that were previously hospitalized due to COVID-19. A hand-searched was then performed through the references of the included systematic review. A quality assessment was performed on the included studies. Out of the 263 articles found through the initial search, 11 studies were included in this systematic review. The selected studies were divided based on follow-up time, in two months follow-up, follow-up between two and six months, and six months follow-up. All the studies highlighted an important impact of post COVID-19 condition in returning to work after being hospitalized, with differences based on follow-up time, home Country and mean/median age of the sample considered. This review highlighted post COVID-19 condition as a rising problem in occupational medicine, with consequences on workers' quality of life and productivity. The role of occupational physicians could be essential in applying limitations to work duties or hours and facilitating the return to employment in workers with a post COVID-19 condition."

During the last decade, many ways to improve veterinarians' wellbeing have been suggested, including both individual and organisational strategies. However, what appears to be lacking is a body of intervention research to test the effectiveness of these strategies.This article outlines some of the types of psychological distress which have been reported in veterinarians, and emphasises key issues such as the impact of practitioners' help-seeking behaviour and moral and ethical dilemmas. Some wellbeing interventions from overseas studies are highlighted, with a focus on strategies that can be adopted by organisations as well as individuals. The review includes several recommendations to improve the psychological wellbeing of veterinarians such as using multi-disciplinary clinician wellbeing models to structure interventions, the possibilities of mindful self-compassion practices, and the regular use of peer support and reflective groups. It concludes that implementation and robust evaluation of wellbeing initiatives in the New Zealand veterinary population are urgently needed."

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing Joint Estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), with contributions from a large network of experts. Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause ischaemic heart disease (IHD). In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from IHD that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality). We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CISDOC, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies which contained an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (prevalence, incidence or mortality). At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effect meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. Thirty-seven studies (26 prospective cohort studies and 11 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 768,751 participants (310,954 females) in 13 countries in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (30 studies) or self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies). The outcome was defined as incident non-fatal IHD event in 19 studies (8 cohort studies, 11 case-control studies), incident fatal IHD event in two studies (both cohort studies), and incident non-fatal or fatal (\"mixed\") event in 16 studies (all cohort studies). Because we judged cohort studies to have a relatively lower risk of bias, we prioritized evidence from these studies and treated evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. IHD incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). No eligible study was found on the effect of long working hours on IHD prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) IHD of working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.07, 20 studies, 312,209 participants, I We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as \"inadequate evidence for harmfulness\" for the exposure categories 41-48 and 49-54 h/week for IHD prevalence, incidence and mortality, and for the exposure category ≥55 h/week for IHD prevalence. Evidence on exposure to working ≥55 h/week was judged as \"sufficient evidence of harmfulness\" for IHD incidence and mortality. Producing estimates for the burden of IHD attributable to exposure to working ≥55 h/week appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates."

Data of 992 frontline medical staff who participated in the prevention and control of COVID-19 was obtained from the online survey conducted in November to December 2021 in China. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9). Moderated mediating model was employed to understand the relationship between long working hours (X), depressive symptoms (Y) mediated through job burnout (M), moderated by family support (W1) and organizational support (W2), while controlling all possible covariates. 56.96% of participants worked more than 8 h per day. 49.8% of them had depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) and 65.8% experienced job-related burnout. Long working hours was positively associated with depressive symptoms score ( Longer working hours and higher job burnout may contribute to worse mental health among frontline medical staff. Social support could buffer the detrimental effects by reducing their job burnout.

This systematic review aims to investigate the impact of WHR on general surgical resident operative caseload. Medline and Embase databases were systematically searched according to PRISMA guidelines to identify articles published between 2003 and 2022 assessing the impact of WHR on the operative experience of general surgical residents. Articles were only included if they reported on quantitative measures of operative experience and examined operative caseload after the introduction of WHR. Of 1,266 studies identified, 26 studies were included, with the majority from US literature. Total major cases underwent a 0.6 % decrease after the introduction of WHR, with surgeon chief cases undergoing a 3.3 % decrease and surgeon junior cases undergoing a 3.7 % increase. Operative trauma underwent the greatest decrease at 18.4 %. Skin & soft tissue cases underwent the greatest increase at 67.6 %. While WHR were often associated with reduced operative caseload in the early years following implementation, the majority of studies found a significant reduction was avoided in the long-term as training programs likely adapted to the new environment. These findings are of particular significance to countries considering the introduction of WHR for surgical residents and may guide future policy and decision-making. This review demonstrated no significant change in total major cases and an increased caseload for most operative subcategories after the introduction of WHR for general surgical residents. These findings are in keeping with a previous review published in 2011."

As previous studies reported adverse health impact of long working hours on metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, it is plausible that NAFLD is also associated with working excessive hours. However, data regarding this issue is limited. In this cross-sectional study based on Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VII, 5,661 working adults without previous liver disease or heavy alcohol drinking habits were included. The subjects were categorized into three groups according to working hours: 36-42, 43-52, and 53-83 hours/week. NAFLD was defined using the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), which is a validated prediction model for determining NAFLD.

By use of a conceptual framework for work as a social determinant of health, we identified six emerging challenges: (1) the influence of technology on the nature of work in high-income countries, culminating in the sudden shift to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the intersectionality of work with gender, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, migrant status, and socioeconomic status as codeterminants of health disparities; (3) the arrival in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries of large migrant labour workforces, who are often subject to adverse working conditions and social exclusion; (4) the development of precarious employment as a feature of many national labour markets; (5) the phenomenon of working long and irregular hours with potential health consequences; and (6) the looming threat of climate change's effects on work. We conclude that profound changes in the nature and availability of work over the past few decades have led to widespread new psychosocial and physical exposures that are associated with adverse health outcomes and contribute to increasing disparities in health. These new exposures at work will require novel and creative methods of data collection for monitoring of their potential health impacts to protect the workforce, and for new research into better means of occupational health promotion and protection. There is also an urgent need for a better integration of occupational health within public health, medicine, the life sciences, and the social sciences, with the work environment explicitly conceptualised as a major social determinant of health."

The development of electronic medical records provides a new way to identify potential participants for trials by matching the eligibility criteria with patients' data within electronic medical records. A literature search was performed to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the electronic medical record recruitment method using MEDLINE, PubMed, PubMed Central, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ScienceDirect and Cochrane Library databases. These searches generated 11 articles that met the eligibility criteria, and handsearching reference lists generated two additional articles bringing the total number of articles to 13. These articles were subjected to critical appraisal utilising the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Out of the 13 included articles, 11 provided quantitative data on recruitment effectiveness while seven articles provided quantitative data on recruitment efficiency. The automation in screening and patient identification by using alerts, a notification system, to notify research staff of a potential participant, was observed to contribute to higher recruitment yield and reduced workload due to its specificity on participant screening. The use of electronic medical record alerts was found to be associated with better recruitment outcomes when they were sent to dedicated research staff rather than physicians. Using electronic medical records for recruitment was found to be effective due to its capability for patient identification outside working hours and fast processing time, which was particularly useful for clinical trials in acute conditions. Several challenges may hinder the impact of the electronic medical record recruitment method, including the lack of conformity of clinical trial eligibility criteria and electronic medical record data structure and missing data. 'Alert fatigue' could also impact on the effectiveness of this method in the long term. The results from this review supports electronic medical record being an effective and efficient method for clinical trial recruitment. Recommendations were made in order to maximise the potential of the electronic medical record recruitment method and also for future research in order to improve the quality of evidence to support this strategy for recruitment."

        "abstract": "For primary prevention, it is important for public health and clinical medicine to identify and characterize modifiable risk factors of stroke. In existing literature, the impact of occupational variables on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke has been extensively studied. This review summarizes the available data on the significance of occupational variables in stroke. The results of this review suggest that there is sufficient evidence for the relationship between increased risk of stroke and job stress, working in extreme temperatures, long working hours, and/or shift work. The association between long working hours and occupational exposure to noise and chemicals remains inconclusive although several studies have reported this finding. This review will act as a step toward future research and provide information that may serve as a baseline for developing targeted interventions to prevent stroke in the working population."

This study aimed to quantify and value productivity losses and informal care receipt in a sample of LC patients in the UK. The target population comprised LC patients referred to LC specialist clinics. The questionnaires included a health economics questionnaire (HEQ) measuring productivity impacts, informal care receipt and service utilisation, EQ-5D-5L, C19-YRS LC condition-specific measure, and sociodemographic and COVID-19 history variables. Outcomes were changes from the incident infection resulting in LC to the month preceding the survey in paid work status/h, work income, work performance and informal care receipt. The human capital approach valued productivity losses; the proxy goods method valued caregiving hours. The values were extrapolated nationally using published prevalence data. Multilevel regressions, nested by region, estimated associations between the outcomes and patient characteristics. 366 patients responded to HEQ (mean LC duration 449.9 days). 51.7% reduced paid work hours relative to the pre-infection period. Mean monthly work income declined by 24.5%. The average aggregate value of productivity loss since incident infection was £10,929 (95% bootstrap confidence interval £8,844-£13,014) and £5.7 billion (£3.8-£7.6 billion) extrapolated nationally. The corresponding values for informal caregiving were £8,726 (£6,247-£11,204) and £4.8 billion (£2.6-£7.0 billion). Multivariate analyses found significant associations between each outcome and health utility and C19-YRS subscale scores. LC significantly impacts productivity losses and provision of informal care, exacerbated by high national prevalence of LC."

Supporting evidence is weak because most studies examining this employ cross-sectional designs. Systematic searches of twelve bibliographic databases sought experimental and longitudinal studies, published up to May 2021, focusing on LTRCF nursing staff's working conditions and the QoC they provided to older adults. Of the 3577 articles identified, 159 were read entirely, and 11 were retained for inclusion. Higher nursing staff hours worked per resident per day (HPRD) were associated with significant reductions in pressure sores and urinary tract infections. Overall staff qualification levels and numbers of RNs had significant positive influences on QoC. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to combine cohort studies with a quasi-experimental study to explore associations between LTRCF nursing staff's working conditions and older adult residents' QoC. Human factors (including HPRD, staff turnover, skill mix, staff ratios) and the specific working contribution of RNs had overwhelmingly significant influences on QoC. It seems essential that LTRCF supervisory and decision-making bodies should promote optimal working conditions for nursing staff because these have such a direct impact on residents' QoC."

Institutional ethical clearance for the same was taken. Collected data were entered in MS Excel database and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Fisher's One hundred and nine HCWs participated in this, out of which 93 (85.3%) were females and 16 (14.7%) were males. Eighty-four (77.1%) participants were below 40 years. Twenty-three participants (21.1%) were overweight and 37 (33.9%) were obese. There was no significant drop in saturation and rise in heart rate during these hours. On comparing subjective sensations of HCWs, our study found that feeling of uneasiness was found more in less than 40 years age group as compared to more than 40 years. N95 masks were found to have no impact on cardiovascular system and do not lead to hypoxia while working routinely even for prolonged hours."

        "abstract": "The various non-standard schedules required of shift workers force abrupt changes in the timing of sleep and light-dark exposure. These changes result in disturbances of the endogenous circadian system and its misalignment with the environment. Simulated night-shift experiments and field-based studies with shift workers both indicate that the circadian system is resistant to adaptation from a day- to a night-oriented schedule, as determined by a lack of substantial phase shifts over multiple days in centrally controlled rhythms, such as those of melatonin and cortisol. There is evidence that disruption of the circadian system caused by night-shift work results not only in a misalignment between the circadian system and the external light-dark cycle, but also in a state of internal desynchronization between various levels of the circadian system. This is the case between rhythms controlled by the central circadian pacemaker and clock genes expression in tissues such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, hair follicle cells, and oral mucosa cells. The disruptive effects of atypical work schedules extend beyond the expression profile of canonical circadian clock genes and affects other transcripts of the human genome. In general, after several days of living at night, most rhythmic transcripts in the human genome remain adjusted to a day-oriented schedule, with dampened group amplitudes. In contrast to circadian clock genes and rhythmic transcripts, metabolomics studies revealed that most metabolites shift by several hours when working nights, thus leading to their misalignment with the circadian system. Altogether, these circadian and sleep-wake disturbances emphasize the all-encompassing impact of night-shift work, and can contribute to the increased risk of various medical conditions. Here, we review the latest scientific evidence regarding the effects of atypical work schedules on the circadian system, sleep and alertness of shift-working populations, and discuss their potential clinical impacts."

This paper adheres to the relevant EQUATOR guidelines. A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and pertinent articles were selected based on inclusion criteria and quality assessment factors. Two reviewers searched the bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL to collect all the available articles in English and Italian issued between 1992 and August 2017. The reviewers analyzed 19 of the 723 initially extracted references, as they focused on the impact of workload, shifts and sleep deprivation on the probability of making medication errors. The main reasons behind medication errors are stress, fatigue, increased workload, night shifts, nurse staffing ratio and workflow interruptions. These factors can have a significant negative impact on the health and the performance of the employees. It is desirable to extend and deepen the research to identify appropriate measures to minimize medication errors."

External factors, such as shift work, lead to a disruption of these rhythms, often called circadian misalignment. Circadian misalignment has an impact on some physiological markers. However, these proxy measurements do not immediately translate into major clinical health outcomes, as shown by later detrimental health effects of shift work and cardio-metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the effects of shift work on circadian rhythms and its implications in cardio-metabolic disorders and eating patterns. Shift work appears to be a risk factor of overweight, obesity, type 2 diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and the metabolic syndrome. However, past studies showed discordant findings regarding the changes of lipid profile and eating patterns. Most studies were either small and short lab studies, or bigger and longer cohort studies, which could not measure health outcomes in a detailed manner. These two designs explain the heterogeneity of shift schedules, occupations, sample size, and methods across studies. Given the burden of non-communicable diseases and the growing concerns about shift workers' health, novel approaches to study shift work in real contexts are needed and would allow a better understanding of the interlocked risk factors and potential mechanisms involved in the onset of metabolic disorders."

Being tired on the job can lead to safety risks in professions such as healthcare, first responders, manufacturing, and numerous others. In addition to the physical stress and health consequences of shift work, recent evidence links shift work to poor mental health outcomes. The current review examines the literature from 2016 onward, emphasizing the impact of shift work on mental health. Shift work is associated with considerable impacts on sleep, depressed mood and anxiety, substance use, impairments in cognition, lower quality of life, and even suicidal ideation. Pronounced sleep disturbances frequently underlie the mental health consequences of shift work. Shift work can have physical, mental health, and safety consequences. Future research should aim to better understand the interplay of shift work, sleep, and mental health and seek to mitigate the adverse consequences of shift work."

        "abstract": "Nurses comprise the largest component of the health workforce worldwide and numerous models of workforce allocation and profile have been implemented. These include changes in skill mix, grade mix or qualification mix, staff-allocation models, staffing levels, nursing shifts, or nurses' work patterns. This is the first update of our review published in 2011. The purpose of this review was to explore the effect of hospital nurse-staffing models on patient and staff-related outcomes in the hospital setting, specifically to identify which staffing model(s) are associated with: 1) better outcomes for patients, 2) better staff-related outcomes, and, 3) the impact of staffing model(s) on cost outcomes. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers were searched on 22 March 2018 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted-time-series or repeated-measures studies of interventions relating to hospital nurse-staffing models. Participants were patients and nursing staff working in hospital settings. We included any objective reported measure of patient-, staff-related, or economic outcome. The most important outcomes included in this review were: nursing-staff turnover, patient mortality, patient readmissions, patient attendances at the emergency department (ED), length of stay, patients with pressure ulcers, and costs. We worked independently in pairs to extract data from each potentially relevant study and to assess risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. We included 19 studies, 17 of which were included in the analysis and eight of which we identified for this update. We identified four types of interventions relating to hospital nurse-staffing models:- introduction of advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce;- introduction of nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce;- primary nursing; and- staffing models.The studies were conducted in the USA, the Netherlands, UK, Australia, and Canada and included patients with cancer, asthma, diabetes and chronic illness, on medical, acute care, intensive care and long-stay psychiatric units. The risk of bias across studies was high, with limitations mainly related to blinding of patients and personnel, allocation concealment, sequence generation, and blinding of outcome assessment.The addition of advanced or specialist nurses to hospital nurse staffing may lead to little or no difference in patient mortality (3 studies, 1358 participants). It is uncertain whether this intervention reduces patient readmissions (7 studies, 2995 participants), patient attendances at the ED (6 studies, 2274 participants), length of stay (3 studies, 907 participants), number of patients with pressure ulcers (1 study, 753 participants), or costs (3 studies, 617 participants), as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes as being of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether adding nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce reduces costs (1 study, 6769 participants), as we assessed the evidence for this outcome to be of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether primary nursing (3 studies, > 464 participants) or staffing models (1 study, 647 participants) reduces nursing-staff turnover, or if primary nursing (2 studies, > 138 participants) reduces costs, as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes to be of very low certainty. The findings of this review should be treated with caution due to the limited amount and quality of the published research that was included. We have most confidence in our finding that the introduction of advanced or specialist nurses may lead to little or no difference in one patient outcome (i.e. mortality) with greater uncertainty about other patient outcomes (i.e. readmissions, ED attendance, length of stay and pressure ulcer rates). The evidence is of insufficient certainty to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of other types of interventions, including new nurse-staffing models and introduction of nursing assistive personnel, on patient, staff and cost outcomes. Although it has been seven years since the original review was published, the certainty of the evidence about hospital nurse staffing still remains very low."

Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. To assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and eight other databases on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022, applying no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, including controlled before-after (CBA) trials, interrupted time series, and cross-over trials. Eligible trials evaluated any of the following shift schedule components. • Permanency of shifts • Regularity of shift changes • Direction of shift rotation • Speed of rotation • Shift duration • Timing of start of shifts • Distribution of shift schedule • Time off between shifts • Split shifts • Protected sleep • Worker participation We included studies that assessed sleep quality off-shift, sleep duration off-shift, or sleepiness during shifts. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the records recovered by the search, read through the full-text articles of potentially eligible studies, and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, with specific additional domains for non-randomised and cluster-randomised studies. For all stages, we resolved any disagreements by consulting a third review author. We presented the results by study design and combined clinically homogeneous studies in meta-analyses using random-effects models. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with GRADE. We included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory setting and was not considered for drawing conclusions on intervention effects. The included studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. Forward versus backward rotation Three CBA trials (561 participants) investigated the effects of forward rotation versus backward rotation. Only one CBA trial provided sufficient data for the quantitative analysis; it provided very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation compared with backward rotation did not affect sleep quality measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ; mean difference (MD) -0.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.28 to 1.89; 62 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (MD -0.21 hours, 95% CI -3.29 to 2.88; 62 participants). However, there was also very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation reduced sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Faster versus slower rotation Two CBA trials and one non-randomised cross-over trial (341 participants) evaluated faster versus slower shift rotation. We were able to meta-analyse data from two studies. There was low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality off-shift (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.23) and very low-certainty evidence that faster shift rotation reduced sleep duration off-shift (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.01; 2 studies, 282 participants). The SMD for sleep duration translated to an MD of 0.38 hours' less sleep per day (95% CI -0.74 to -0.01). One study provided very low-certainty evidence that faster rotations decreased sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Limited shift duration (16 hours) versus unlimited shift duration Two RCTs (760 participants) evaluated 80-hour workweeks with maximum daily shift duration of 16 hours versus workweeks without any daily shift duration limits. There was low-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit increased sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78; which translated to an MD of 0.73 hours' more sleep per day, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 760 participants) and moderate-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit reduced sleepiness during shifts, measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14; which translated to an MD of 0.37 fewer points, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.17; 2 RCTs, 716 participants). Shorter versus longer shifts One RCT, one CBA trial, and one non-randomised cross-over trial (692 participants) evaluated shorter shift duration (eight to 10 hours) versus longer shift duration (two to three hours longer). There was very low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.15; which translated to an MD of 0.13 points lower on a scale of 1 to 5; 2 studies, 111 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.54; which translated to an MD of 0.26 hours' less sleep per day; 2 studies, 121 participants). The RCT and the non-randomised cross-over study found that shorter shifts reduced sleepiness during shifts, while the CBA study found no effect on sleepiness. More compressed versus more spread out shift schedules One RCT and one CBA trial (346 participants) evaluated more compressed versus more spread out shift schedules. The CBA trial provided very low-certainty evidence of no difference between the groups in sleep quality off-shift (MD 0.31 points, 95% CI -0.53 to 1.15) and sleep duration off-shift (MD 0.52 hours, 95% CI -0.52 to 1.56). Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes. There is a need for more high-quality studies (preferably RCTs) for all shift schedule interventions to draw conclusions on the effects of shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers."

        "abstract": "To explore the evidence on nurses' experiences and preferences around shift patterns in the international literature. Electronic databases (CINHAL, MEDLINE and Scopus) were searched to identify primary studies up to April 2021. Papers reporting qualitative or quantitative studies exploring the subjective experience and/or preferences of nurses around shift patterns were considered, with no restrictions on methods, date or setting. Key study features were extracted including setting, design and results. Findings were organised thematically by key features of shift work. 30 relevant papers were published between 1993 and 2021. They contained mostly qualitative studies where nurses reflected on their experience and preferences around shift patterns. The studies reported on three major aspects of shift work: shift work per se (i.e. the mere fact of working shift), shift length, and time of shift. Across all three aspects of shift work, nurses strive to deliver high quality of care despite facing intense working conditions, experiencing physical and mental fatigue or exhaustion. Preference for or adaptation to a specific shift pattern is facilitated when nurses are consulted before its implementation or have a certain autonomy to self-roster. Days off work tend to mitigate the adverse effects of working (short, long, early or night) shifts. How shift work and patterns impact on experiences and preferences seems to also vary according to nurses' personal characteristics and circumstances (e.g. age, caring responsibilities, years of experience). Shift patterns are often organised in ways that are detrimental to nurses' health and wellbeing, their job performance, and the patient care they provide. Further research should explore the extent to which nurses' preferences are considered when choosing or being imposed shift work patterns. Research should also strive to better describe and address the constraints nurses face when it comes to choice around shift patterns."

One hundred and thirty active nurses (84 rotating-shift and 46 day-shift workers) in the Nurses' Health Study II wore a head-mounted light meter and collected spontaneous urine voids over 3 days. 6-Sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), the major urinary metabolite of melatonin, was assessed. Rotating-shift workers on night shifts had more light exposure and lower urinary melatonin levels during the night, and urinary melatonin rhythms with smaller peaks [11.81 ng/mg-creatinine/h, 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.49-14.71 vs. 14.83 ng/mg-creatinine/h, 95% CI, 11.72-18.75] and later peak onset (5.71 hours, 95% CI, 4.76-6.85 vs. 4.10 hours, 95% CI, 3.37-4.99), compared with day-shift workers. Furthermore, evening chronotypes' melatonin rhythms had later peak onset compared with morning types (4.90 hours, 95% CI, 3.94-6.09 vs. 3.64 hours, 95% CI, 2.99-4.43). However, among day-shift workers, morning chronotypes had melatonin rhythms with greater mean levels, larger peaks, and earlier peak onset compared with evening chronotypes; patterns were similar comparing evening versus morning chronotypes among rotating-shift workers on night shifts. The interaction of rotating-shift work and chronotype was significant across all parameters ( As expected, rotating-shift workers on night shifts had greater light exposure and lower urinary melatonin levels during the night compared with day-shift workers. Intriguingly, melatonin rhythms were dependent on both chronotype and rotating-shift work type, and better alignment of rotating-shift work and chronotype appeared to produce less disrupted melatonin rhythms. The joint effects of shift-work type and chronotype require attention in future studies."

We investigated the effect of scheduling practices, physical and psychological characteristics related to shift work, and personal habits during shift work on depression and anxiety among nurses.

Medical professionals and specifically resident physicians, who are involved in long-term nightshift schedules during their post-graduate training, are prone to acute and chronic sleep deprivation and disruption, putting them at risk for making medical errors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of chronic and acute-on-chronic sleep deprivation and disruption among residents on selected physiological and cognitive measures. Thirty-three medical and surgical residents were evaluated twice - at baseline and after a 26-hour shift. Eighteen young attending physicians who did not engage in nightshift schedules served as controls and were evaluated once. Measures included morning cortisol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), computerised tests of attention and behaviour, the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, a risk-taking questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Residents, but not attendings, reported chronic sleep disruption and deprivation. Residents at baseline exhibited reduced morning cortisol levels and elevated hs-CRP levels, compared to attendings. Residents at baseline had impaired global executive function compared to attendings. A nightshift with acute sleep deprivation further reduced residents' executive function. Residents at baseline and after a nightshift demonstrated increased impulsivity and slower processing time than attendings. Residents and attendings did not differ in risk-taking tendencies which were assessed in a separate cohort. In a real-life setting, resident physicians exhibit increased low-grade systemic inflammation (hs-CRP) and impaired HPA-axis function. Their chronic sleep curtailment is associated with greater impulsivity, slower cognitive processing, and impaired executive function. Future research is warranted to understand how improving working schedule by increasing sleep duration may minimise the short-term and potential long-term risks to physicians in training."

These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within the context of the events of the day, but they also reveal prevailing societal attitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing school curricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today's topics and times. This month's article is by public health expert Dorothy Deming, whose many roles over her long career included director of the Visiting Nurse Association in Holyoke, Massachusetts; editor of Public Health Nursing; and author of the Penny Marsh: Public Health Nurse series for young adult readers. In her October 1957 AJN article, Deming recalls her experiences as a nursing student in New York City during the 1918 influenza pandemic. She and a classmate managed a 32-bed women's influenza unit through 12-hour night shifts, a \"baptism of fire for a young nurse,\" she writes. Deming describes shifts that sound eerily familiar given today's COVID-19 pandemic: overcrowded units, staff shortages, patients whose condition could change \"in split seconds,\" and the emotional impact of working under these conditions.

Indeed, it is conceivable that shift- and night shift-work, affecting sleep-wake rhythms, may impact thyroid functionality. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to provide an overview on the association between shift- and night shift-work and thyroid hormonal changes and disease development. A systematic review of studies available in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases was performed. A positive association between night shift-work and increased TSH concentrations was reported by most of the reviewed investigations. Inconclusive evidence was available on thyroid diseases. However, the limited number of studies, the noticeable heterogeneity in the shift-work scheduling, in terms of amount, duration, type of shift- or night shift-work, prevents easily integrating findings and extrapolating definite conclusions. Further investigation seems necessary to better define the relationship between shift schedules and different thyroid outcomes, and possible long-term implications of early functional changes. Overall, this may support the adoption of advanced risk assessment and management strategies aimed to achieve a safer workplace organization and a timely, responsible realization of all the benefits of a 24-h economy."

Shifts of 12 h or longer have become increasingly common for nurses in hospitals in some European countries. Longer shifts offer a potential to benefit from a compressed working week, with fewer work days and more days off-work, lower commuting costs, and increased flexibility. Most people find shift work less desirable compared to standard working hours. A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted at the Mostar University Hospital in 2019. A total of 157 subjects participated in the study, 22 (14%) of which were male (medical technicians) and 135 (86%) female (nurses). The mean age of study subjects was 33.3 years (min=20, max=54, SD=8.033). Results of this study suggested that nurses working irregular rotating shifts, with more family members to look after and more than 18 years of professional experience were affected by sleep disturbances between shifts. The study showed that shift work nurses had significantly higher levels of cortisol and prolactin compared with first-shift nurses/medical technicians. The results of this study are expected to stimulate further studies of sleep disturbances among shift nurses."

Forty-five studies investigated longitudinal changes in sleep, mental health, or physical health outcomes and 29 studies investigated predictors of SWT (i.e., better sleep, mental and physical health). Sleep and mental health outcomes worsened following the onset of shift work, while physical health did not significantly change. Pre-shift work mental health, sleep, and work characteristics predicted SWT later in workers' careers. Shift work adversely impacts new workers' sleep and mental health early in their career, and interventions before beginning shift work are needed to promote better SWT."

        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers quickly shifted to remote teaching with many teachers experiencing increased work demands with limited resources, affecting both mental health and work. Within a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the relationship between one type of work demand, non-standard work schedule characteristics, and depressive and burnout symptoms in kindergarten through 8th grade U.S. teachers working remotely in May 2020. We further assessed the impact of COVID-19 and work resources. Work schedule characteristics were self-assessed across six domains on a 5-point frequency scale from always (1) to never (5). We used multilevel Poisson models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In fully adjusted models, frequently working unexpectedly was associated with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (PR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07-1.31, p < 0.01), high emotional exhaustion (PR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.30, p < 0.01), and high depersonalization (PR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.02-1.92, p = 0.03). Remote work resources were significantly associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (PR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98, p = 0.02). There was a linear association between low coworker support and a low sense of personal accomplishment (PR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.53-0.87, p < 0.01). Frequently having to work unexpectedly while remote teaching was associated with symptoms of depression and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workplaces should support predictable working times to lessen the disruption caused by unexpected work to promote worker well-being."

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is an important public health problem worldwide. Among the countries with a very high population risk of fractures, there are those with the highest level of economic development. Osteoporotic fractures are the main cause of disability among elderly people, and the resultant disabilities require particularly large financial support associated not only with the direct treatment of the fracture but also with the necessity for long-term rehabilitation and care for the disabled person. Many well-established factors can have impact on bone mass and fracture risk. Recently, it has been hypothesized that working during nighttime which leads to endocrine disorders may have an indirect impact on bone physiology among night shift workers. Therefore, it can be presumed that the night shift work may contribute to the etiology of osteoporosis. The aim of our work was to make a review of the epidemiological evidence on the association between night shift work and bone mineral density or fracture risk as well as to discuss the potential biological mechanisms linking the work under this system with the development of osteoporosis. We have identified only four studies investigating the association between system of work and bone mineral density or fracture risk among workers. The findings of three out of four studies support the hypothesis. None of the studies has investigated a potential relationship between night shift work and bone turnover markers. Given that there have been no epidemiological studies in European countries that would concern working populations and the noticeable difference in the risk of osteoporosis between communities, further studies are warranted to elucidate the problem. It is presumed that further in-depth studies will not only identify the underlying factors of the disease but also contribute to developing guidelines for policy makers and employers for primary prevention of osteoporosis in workplace."

        "abstract": "Particular working conditions and/or organization of working time may cause important sleep disturbances that have been proposed to be predictive of cognitive decline. In this regard, circadian rhythm misalignment induced by exposure to night work or long working hours would be responsible for cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, evidence supporting this correlation is limited and several issues still need to be elucidated. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between shift/night work and cognitive impairment and address its main determinants. Information provided by the reviewed studies suggested that night work might have serious immediate negative effects especially on cognitive domains related to attention, memory and response inhibition. Furthermore, cognitive performance would progressively worsen over consecutive night shifts or following exposure to very long work shifts. Otherwise, conflicting results emerged regarding the possible etiological role that night work chronic exposure would have on cognitive impairment. Therefore, circadian rhythm desynchronization, lack of sleep and fatigue resulting from night work may negatively impact worker's cognitive efficiency. However, in light of the considerable methodological variability of the reviewed studies, we proposed to develop a standardized research and evaluation strategy in order to obtain a better and comprehensive understanding of this topic."

Forty maritime pilots were recruited from Australian ports. Sleep wake-behaviour (timing and length), and self-reported sleep quality and fatigue, were assessed to determine any impact of roster status and 'on-call' status. On-roster pilots experienced reduced night time sleep duration compared to those off-roster (57 ± 8.8 min), while working on-call also diminished night time sleep duration (126 ± 11.3 min) and quality, compared to workers not on-call. Fatigue scores indicated that participants were not fully recovered prior to commencing rostered night shift, while sleep quality was significantly worse following sleep that occurred after a night shift, compared to after a day shift. These findings potentially support workplace negotiations to change future shift cycles, and to adopt monitoring systems that may mitigate the risk of fatigue-related accidents and chronic health outcomes."

This review summarizes current evidence on the relation between shift work and risk of obesity, with a particular emphasis on potential sex differences. Observational data strongly point towards an association between shift work and heightened risk of prevalent and incident obesity, and particularly abdominal obesity. Circadian misalignment and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are the primary culprits mediating such association. As it pertains to sex differences in the impact of shift work on obesity, few studies have examined this aspect, and findings are conflicting. Shift work is an important risk factor for obesity, with likely multiple biological and behavioral mediators. However, whether there is a sex-dependent vulnerability to the obesogenic effects of shift work is unclear. This area presents opportunities for future research."

        "abstract": "Shift work is associated with susceptibility to several neuropsychiatric disorders. This study aims to investigate the effect of shift work on the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, and highlighting how individual variability may influence the association. UK Biobank participants with employment information were included. Cox survival was conducted in main and subgroup analyses. Correlation analyses explored the impact of shift work on brain structures, and mediation analyses were performed to elucidate the shared underlying mechanisms. Shift work tolerance was evaluated through survival analyses contrasting the risks associated with five neuropsychiatric disorders in shift versus non-shift workers across different demographic or occupational strata. The analysis encompassed 254,646 participants. Shift work was associated with higher risk of dementia (HR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.10-1.52), anxiety (1.08, 1.01-1.15), depression (1.29, 1.22-1.36), and sleep disorders (1.18, 1.09-1.28), but not stroke (p = 0.20). Shift work was correlated with decreasing volume of various brain regions, particularly in thalamus, lateral orbitofrontal, and middle temporal. Mediation analysis revealed that increased immune response and glucose levels are common pathways linking shift work to these disorders. We observed diversity in shift work tolerance across different individual characteristics, among which socioeconomic status and length of working hours were the most essential. Self-reported employment information may cause misclassification and recall bias. And since we focused on the middle-aged population, the conclusions may not be representative of younger or older populations. Our findings indicated the need to monitor shift worker health and provide personalized management to help adapt to shift work."

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)-Scale (≥17 points defined as high symptoms) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) with a cutoff ≥9, or prescription of an anti-depressant. The definition of shift work included work hours outside 7:00 to 18:00, whereas night work was defined as a shift including work between 0:00 and 5:00. Poisson regression with robust error variances was calculated to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age at follow-up, diurnal preference, monthly household income and education. Analyses were stratified by sex. We performed various sensitivity and stratified analyses to test the robustness of our results. At baseline, 1,500 gainfully employed subjects, 45-73 years of age and without a history of depression, were included. Until the 5-year follow-up, 896 participants were observed, and 486 participants survived through the 10-year follow-up. Although most analyses did not reach the level of formal statistical significance, women working night shifts tended to show increased relative risks for depressive symptoms according to the PHQ (RR = 1.78; 95% CI 0.71-4.45), in particular when working night shifts for ≥20 years (RR = 2.70; 95% CI 0.48-15.4). Stratification by age group revealed no increased risks among women above 60 years of age. Stratified analyses indicated that over-commitment was associated with higher risks for depressive symptoms among women (RR = 4.59; 95% CI 0.95-22.2 in the CES-D and RR = 12.7; 95% CI 2.89-56.1 in the PHQ). Exclusion of subgroups for the purpose of sensitivity analyses generally strengthened associations in women, whereas little evidence for an increased risk of depression remained among male shift workers. In summary, negative effects on depression were suggested among female shift workers, although results were based on small numbers. Among men, we did not identify consistently increased risks for depressive symptoms in relation to shift work."

The etiology of migraine is still uncertain, and various individual and/or environmental risk factors have been suggested as triggers of the attacks, including irregularities in the sleep-wake rhythm. In this perspective, it is possible that shift and night work, affecting circadian rhythms, may play a key function in the disease pathogenesis. Therefore, aim of this review was to provide an overview on the possible association between shift works and migraine development or clinical outcomes. A systematic review of literature studies available in Pubmed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases, addressing the possible shift work-migraine relationship was performed. Conflicting data emerged from the revised studies. Some results supported a positive association between migraine prevalence and shift works, according to peculiar job tasks, seniority in shift works, specific work schedules, and number of night shifts performed in a month. However, other investigations failed to confirm such findings. The limited number of available studies, their cross-sectional nature, the different criteria employed for migraine diagnosis, and the various shift work schedules analyzed, together with exposure to other confounding factors on workplace do not allow to extrapolate definite conclusions on shift work-migraine relationship. From an occupational health perspective, further studies appear necessary to better understand such exposure-disease association and possibly define risk assessment and management strategies to protect the health of susceptible and/or migraine affected workers."

This systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive summary of existing research examining the association between different types of shift work and mental health. The review included large-scale, non-occupation-specific research. Four electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and SCOPUS were searched to identify studies that reported on the statistical association between shift work and mental health and that used population-based samples. Two reviewers extracted information about study characteristics and data on the association between shift work and mental health. A meta-analysis was performed for longitudinal studies adopting a 'broad binary' measure of shift work. Thirty-three studies were included in the final review-10 cross-sectional studies, 22 longitudinal studies, and 1 study that included both. Findings were grouped based on whether the measure of shift work focussed on: (1) night/evening work, (2) weekend work, (3) irregular/unpredictable work schedule, or (4) a broad binary measure. There was a reasonable level of evidence that overall, when a broad binary measure was adopted, shift work was associated with poorer mental health-this finding was supported by the meta-analysis results. There was also some evidence that irregular/unpredictable work was associated with poorer mental health. There was less evidence for night/evening and minimal evidence for weekend work. Inconsistencies in study methodology, limited contrasting and combining the results. The association between shift work and mental health is different across types of shift work. The evidence is strongest for a broad binary, general measure of shift work and for irregular or unpredictable shift work. There is a need for continued research that adopts consistent and clear measures of shift work."

To synthesize and discuss findings in the selected research articles. To investigate the impact of the results in relation to medical imaging and safety. A systematic review of the literature was planned and executed to meet the above objectives. Narrative synthesis was used to describe the heterogeneous findings of the studies appraised. Four of the five studies selected after critical appraisal suggested a positive correlation of error with increased mental and physical fatigue as a result of shift work or rapid shift rotation. No studies directly investigated medical imaging professionals. Considerations need to be made when optimising shift work for healthcare professionals so as to avoid Shift Work Disorder and consequential error; particularly in the context of ionising radiation. Research into environmental and lifestyle support should be pursued to study its effect as prevention or management. Further direct study with radiographers is recommended."

By use of a conceptual framework for work as a social determinant of health, we identified six emerging challenges: (1) the influence of technology on the nature of work in high-income countries, culminating in the sudden shift to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the intersectionality of work with gender, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, migrant status, and socioeconomic status as codeterminants of health disparities; (3) the arrival in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries of large migrant labour workforces, who are often subject to adverse working conditions and social exclusion; (4) the development of precarious employment as a feature of many national labour markets; (5) the phenomenon of working long and irregular hours with potential health consequences; and (6) the looming threat of climate change's effects on work. We conclude that profound changes in the nature and availability of work over the past few decades have led to widespread new psychosocial and physical exposures that are associated with adverse health outcomes and contribute to increasing disparities in health. These new exposures at work will require novel and creative methods of data collection for monitoring of their potential health impacts to protect the workforce, and for new research into better means of occupational health promotion and protection. There is also an urgent need for a better integration of occupational health within public health, medicine, the life sciences, and the social sciences, with the work environment explicitly conceptualised as a major social determinant of health."

This calls for new research to investigate how the working environment and characteristics impact the occupational health of workers at gas stations. However, minimal research has been conducted in this field, especially those involving psychological and behavioural factors, occupational stress, and so forth. This review was performed to investigate the present condition of the occupational risk of gas station workers in this safety-critical position. Five databases (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO) were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies. Results were selected according to these criteria: studies on fatigue, shift work, sleep, and physical and mental health of gas station employees; published on or before November 11, 2021; papers in English. Twenty studies were considered for the final analysis. The results showed that shift work at gas stations leads to psychological and physiological problems. The psychological consequences included anxiety, stress, and depression, while the physiological consequences included biochemical changes and lifestyle consequences. Shift work and the specific working environment of gas station employees adversely affect their sleep, stress levels, physical and mental health, and turnover intention. This systematic review allowed us to consider the occupational risk factors that can lead to sickness or accidents and contribute to reducing these risk factors. Realistic countermeasures ought to be established and interventions must be explored to mitigate risks to life, property, and the environment in operating gas stations."

This review aimed to synthesize the magnitude of the potential impact of SW on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and hypertension (HTN). MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for epidemiological studies evaluating BP and/or HTN diagnosis among shift workers, compared with day workers. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed and the results were expressed as pooled mean differences or odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Forty-five studies were included, involving 117,252 workers. We found a significant increase in both SBD and DBP among permanent night workers (2.52 mmHg, 95% CI 0.75-4.29 and 1.76 mmHg, 95% CI 0.41-3.12, respectively). For rotational shift workers, both with and without night work, we found a significant increase but only for SBP (0.65 mmHg, 95% CI 0.07-1.22 and 1.28 mmHg, 95% CI 0.18-2.39, respectively). No differences were found for HTN. Our findings suggest that SW is associated with an increase of BP, mainly for permanent night workers and for SBP. This is of special interest given the large number of susceptible workers exposed over time."

Understanding the mechanisms by which OSA potentiates cardiometabolic risk of patients remains a current challenge. Sleep disruption is highly prevalent among shift workers and shift work (SW) is an important modulator of circadian rhythms, with health consequences intimately related to cardiometabolic health. Since the circadian timing system (CTS) interacts with the normal functioning of the ANS, CTS impact on OSA patients should be closely assessed. This review raises the question of whether SW-induced circadian misalignment potentiates the cardiometabolic risk of OSA patients, providing a novel perspective on the role of autonomic modulation as a key downstream mechanism linking cardiometabolic risk with both OSA and CTS misalignment."

It can contribute to the increased risk of various medical conditions, including reproductive and sexual health issues. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of shift work with night shifts on midwives' reproductive and sexual health. This cross-sectional, exploratory study included 520 midwives. A descriptive questionnaire was distributed in person (414) and online (106) from July 2019 to May 2020. We used the Female Sexual Function Index (PL-FSFI) standardized questionnaire and proprietary research tools (applicable to demographic and social data and reproductive health). All statistical calculations were performed with the IBM SPSS 23 statistical package. Shift work affects midwives' reproductive and sexual health. Midwives working night shifts are more likely to experience reproductive problems and sexual dysfunctions. The most pronounced differences are observed in the experience of infertility and the number of miscarriages. PL-FSFI results clearly showed the adverse impact of working shifts including night shifts on functioning in various dimensions of sexual health. Shift work negatively affects reproductive and sexual health and causes work-life conflict experience. It is necessary to develop procedures that minimize shift rotation and implement work schedules that allow for recuperation or rest and ensure proper family and social life."

Impaired concentration and cognition negatively affect employee safety. To examine the evidence of the impact of shift work organization, specifically work hours and scheduling, on nurse injuries including needlestick and sharps injuries, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes, and work-related accidents causing a near miss or actual injury to the nurse. A scoping review was conducted using search results from five bibliographic databases. Through database searching, 7788 articles were identified. During the title and abstract screening, 5475 articles were excluded. Full text screening eliminated 1971 articles. During the data extraction phase, 206 articles were excluded leaving 34 articles from 14 countries in the scoping review. The results of the review suggest a strong association in nurses between long work hours and overtime and an increased risk for needlestick and sharps injuries, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes, and other work-related accidents. Rotating shifts increase the risk for needlestick and sharps injuries and other work-related accidents while night and rotating shifts increase the risk for drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes. Proper management of work hours and scheduling is essential to maximize recovery time and reduce or prevent nurse injuries. Nurse leaders, administrators, and managers, have a responsibility to create a culture of safety. This begins with safe scheduling practices, closely monitoring for near miss and actual nurse injuries, and implementing evidence-based practice strategies to reduce these occurrences."

Narrative review. Several literature searches using broad terms such as \"sleep deprivation,\" \"veterinary,\" \"physician,\" and \"surgeon\" were performed using PubMed and Google scholar. Sleep deprivation and insufficient rest have clear and deleterious effects on job performance, which in healthcare occupations impacts patient safety and practice function. The unique requirements of a career in veterinary surgery, which may include on-call shifts and overnight work, can lead to distinct sleep challenges and chronic insufficient rest with resultant serious but often poorly recognized impacts. These effects negatively impact practices, teams, surgeons, and patients. The self-assessment of fatigue and performance effect is demonstrably untrustworthy, reinforcing the need for institution-level protections. While the issues are complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach, duty hour or workload restrictions may be an important first step in addressing these issues within veterinary surgery, as it has been in human medicine. Systematic re-examination of cultural expectations and practice logistics are needed if improvement in working hours, clinician well-being, productivity, and patient safety are to occur. A more comprehensive understanding of the magnitude and consequence of sleep-related impairment better enables surgeons and hospital management to address systemic challenges in veterinary practice and training programs."

The PVT has been widely used as a measure to assess vigilant attention among shift workers, but information evaluating the application and performance of this test in different naturalistic shift work settings is limited. The purpose of this review is to synthesise and evaluate existing literature which has used the PVT to assess and monitor psychomotor performance in response to shift work schedules and rosters performed in real-world settings. A systematic search of studies examining PVT performance in response to 24/7 shift work schedules (e.g., day, afternoon, evening and night shifts) performed under naturalistic conditions was conducted. Articles were identified by searching Medline, Embase, CINHAL and PsycINFO databases in April 2020. The search yielded 135 results, of which 16 publications were suitable to be included in this review. Articles were grouped according to when the PVT was applied to a research cohort, which included (a) multiple instances per shift, (b) commencement and cessation of shift and (c) other varying times. This review suggests PVT performance is typically congruent across studies when the test is applied at generally consistent time intervals. The lack of research concerning the use of the PVT during extended duty shifts (e.g., shifts and on call work > 30 h) is an area for future research."

Those with an evening preference may be better suited to shift work, but also carry higher risk of adverse health. Shift work leads to misalignment of circadian rhythms and is associated with increased risk of inflammatory disease such as asthma and cancer. Here, we investigate the association between chronotype, shift work, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The associations between exposures of shift work and chronotype on risk of RA were studied in up to 444,210 U.K. Biobank participants. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for covariates: age, sex, ethnicity, alcohol intake, smoking history, Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI), sleep duration, length of working week, and body mass index (BMI). After adjusting for covariates, individuals with a morning chronotype had lower odds of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA; odds ratio [OR]: 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.99) when compared to intermediate chronotypes. The association between morning chronotype and RA persisted with a more stringent RA case definition (covariate-adjusted OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.97). When adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and TDI, shift workers had higher odds of RA (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.1-1.36) compared to day workers that attenuated to the null after further covariate adjustment (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.98-1.22). Morning chronotypes working permanent night shifts had significantly higher odds of RA compared to day workers (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.19-2.99). These data point to a role for circadian rhythms in RA pathogenesis. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms underlying this association and understand the potential impact of shift work on chronic inflammatory disease and its mediating factors."

While for some sectors, such as emergency services, around-the-clock work is a necessary and critical societal obligation, work outside of traditional daytime schedules has been associated with many occupational safety and health hazards and their associated costs. Thus, organizational- and policy-level decisions on nonstandard work hours can be difficult and are based on several factors including economic evaluation. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge of economic benefits and costs associated with these schedules. We conducted a scoping review of the methodology and data used to examine the economic benefits and costs of nonstandard work hours and related interventions to mitigate risks. Ten studies met all our inclusion criteria. Most studies used aggregation and analysis of national and other large datasets. Costs estimated include health-related expenses, productivity losses, and projections of future loss of earnings. Cost analyses of interventions were provided for an obstructive sleep apnea screening program, implementation of an employer-based educational program, and increased staffing to cover overtime hours. A paucity of studies assess nonstandard work hours using economic terms. Future studies are needed to expand economic evaluations beyond the employer level to include those at the societal level because impacts of nonstandard work go beyond the workplace and are important for policy analysis and formulation. We pose the opportunity for researchers and employers to share data and resources in the development of more analyses that fill these research gaps."

        "abstract": "The objective of this review was to examine the available evidence on the experiences and perceptions of nurses working the night shift within any specialty in the acute care, subacute, or long-term care setting. Nurses are required for around-the-clock patient care. Night shift nurses can experience detrimental effects because of their work hours, which disrupt their normal circadian rhythm. Understanding nurses' experiences and perceptions when working night shift will facilitate the development of strategies to minimize the potential negative effects of working at night. In examining nurses' experiences and perceptions of working night shift, there is scope to explore how to improve night shift nurses' practice environment and job satisfaction, which will then translate to improved nurse and patient outcomes. This review included qualitative studies focused on the experiences and perceptions of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who work the night shift or rotate between day and night shift. This review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. The methodology used was consistent with the a priori protocol. Studies included in this review were those published in full text, English, and between 1983 (when the seminal work on hospitals that attract and retain nurses was published) and February 2021, when the search was completed. The main databases searched for published and unpublished studies included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.From the search, two reviewers independently screened the studies against the inclusion criteria, and then papers selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative data were extracted from the included papers independently by the four reviewers. Results from each reviewer were discussed and clarified to reach agreement. The extracted findings were pooled and examined for shared meaning, coded, and grouped into categories. Common categories were grouped into meta-synthesis to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings were graded using the ConQual approach to determine the level of confidence (trust) users may have in the value of the synthesized findings. Thirty-four papers, representing 33 studies, met the criteria for inclusion. The studies were conducted in 11 countries across six continents, with a total of 601 participants. From these, a total of 220 findings were extracted and combined to form 11 categories based on similarity in meaning, and three syntheses were derived: i) The \"Other\" Shift: the distinctiveness of night nursing; ii) Juggling sleep and all aspects of life when working nights; and iii) Existing in the Twilight Zone: battling the negative impact of sleep deprivation consumes nurses who strive to keep patients, self, and others safe. The major conclusions from this review are the uniqueness of working the night shift and the sleep deprivation of night nurses. Organizational strategies and support are needed for those working this shift, which will enhance nurse and patient safety. PROSPERO CRD42019135294."

        "abstract": "Particular working conditions and/or organization of working time may cause important sleep disturbances that have been proposed to be predictive of cognitive decline. In this regard, circadian rhythm misalignment induced by exposure to night work or long working hours would be responsible for cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, evidence supporting this correlation is limited and several issues still need to be elucidated. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between shift/night work and cognitive impairment and address its main determinants. Information provided by the reviewed studies suggested that night work might have serious immediate negative effects especially on cognitive domains related to attention, memory and response inhibition. Furthermore, cognitive performance would progressively worsen over consecutive night shifts or following exposure to very long work shifts. Otherwise, conflicting results emerged regarding the possible etiological role that night work chronic exposure would have on cognitive impairment. Therefore, circadian rhythm desynchronization, lack of sleep and fatigue resulting from night work may negatively impact worker's cognitive efficiency. However, in light of the considerable methodological variability of the reviewed studies, we proposed to develop a standardized research and evaluation strategy in order to obtain a better and comprehensive understanding of this topic."

Impaired concentration and cognition negatively affect employee safety. To examine the evidence of the impact of shift work organization, specifically work hours and scheduling, on nurse injuries including needlestick and sharps injuries, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes, and work-related accidents causing a near miss or actual injury to the nurse. A scoping review was conducted using search results from five bibliographic databases. Through database searching, 7788 articles were identified. During the title and abstract screening, 5475 articles were excluded. Full text screening eliminated 1971 articles. During the data extraction phase, 206 articles were excluded leaving 34 articles from 14 countries in the scoping review. The results of the review suggest a strong association in nurses between long work hours and overtime and an increased risk for needlestick and sharps injuries, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes, and other work-related accidents. Rotating shifts increase the risk for needlestick and sharps injuries and other work-related accidents while night and rotating shifts increase the risk for drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes. Proper management of work hours and scheduling is essential to maximize recovery time and reduce or prevent nurse injuries. Nurse leaders, administrators, and managers, have a responsibility to create a culture of safety. This begins with safe scheduling practices, closely monitoring for near miss and actual nurse injuries, and implementing evidence-based practice strategies to reduce these occurrences."

Numerous trials have come to conflicting conclusions about the impact on patient safety of eliminating extended duration work shifts. We conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the impact of work hour policies and work schedules on patient safety. After identifying 8,362 potentially relevant studies and reviewing 688 full-text articles, 132 studies were retained and graded on quality of evidence. Of these, 68 studies provided enough information for consideration in meta-analyses. We found that patient safety improved following implementation of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's 2003 and 2011 resident physicians work hour guidelines. Limiting all resident physicians to 80-hour work weeks and 28-hour shifts in 2003 was associated with an 11% reduction in mortality (p < 0.001). Limited shift durations and shorter work weeks were also associated with improved patient safety in clinical trials and observational studies not specifically tied to policy changes. Given the preponderance of evidence showing that patient and physician safety is negatively affected by long work hours, efforts to improve physician schedules should be prioritized. Policies that enable extended-duration shifts and long work weeks should be reexamined. Further research should expand beyond resident physicians to additional study populations, including attending physicians and other health care workers."

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transition to remote work, leading to increased attention on presenteeism and absenteeism among remote workers. Understanding the implications of these phenomena on worker health and productivity is crucial for optimizing remote work arrangements and developing policies to improve employee well-being. This scoping review aims to examine the occurrence of presenteeism and absenteeism among remote workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the interrelated physical and mental health issues during these periods. PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Eric, Business Source Premier, SCOPUS, and sociological abstracts were searched resulting in 1792 articles. Articles were included if the population of interest was 18+ (i.e., working age), engaged in full or part-time work, and the employees shifted from in-person to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All study designs, geographical areas, and papers written post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were included; however, systematic reviews were excluded. Data was charted into Microsoft Excel by 2 independent reviewers. The literature search identified 10 studies (i.e., seven cross-sectional studies, two qualitative studies, and one observational study). Five major overarching themes were identified specifically (1) telework and mental health (2) telework and physical health (3) worker benefits (4) gender dynamics and (5) difficulty navigating the teleworking environment. While remote work offers flexibility in terms of saved commute time and flexible work schedules, it also exacerbates challenges related to presenteeism, absenteeism, and work-life balance. These challenges include experiencing psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, musculoskeletal pain, difficulties concentrating at work for both women and working parents, struggles disconnecting after hours, and the inability to delineate between the work and home environment. The findings suggest that remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic has both positive and negative implications for worker well-being and productivity. However, future research needs to incorporate the potential effects of telework frequency (full time vs. part time) on employee productivity and its role on presenteeism and absenteeism, to gain a more comprehensive understanding on remote work difficulties. Addressing these challenges requires proactive interventions and support mechanisms to promote worker health and productivity in remote settings."

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers, who protect and improve the health of individuals, are critical to the success of health systems and achieving national and global health goals. To respond effectively to the healthcare needs of populations, healthcare workers themselves must be in a good state of health. However, healthcare workers face various psychosocial pressures, including having to work night shifts, long working hours, demands of patient care, medical disputes, workplace violence, and emotional distress due to poor interactions with patients and colleagues, and poor promotion prospects. Constant exposure to these psychosocial hazards adversely impacts healthcare workers' health. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the influence of effort-reward imbalance, job satisfaction, and work engagement on self-rated health of healthcare workers. The results would be conducive to providing policy guidance to improve the health of healthcare workers. We analysed the data of 1327 participants from The Chinese Sixth National Health and Services Survey in Sichuan Province that was conducted from August 2018 to October 2018. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. Only 40.1% of healthcare workers rated their health as 'relatively good' or 'good'. Effort-reward imbalance had a significant negative correlation with self-rated health (β = - 0.053, 95% CI [- 0.163, - 0.001]). The associations of effort-reward imbalance and work engagement with self-rated health were both mediated by job satisfaction (95% CI [- 0.150, - 0.050] and [0.011, 0.022]), and work engagement mediated the relationship between effort-reward imbalance and self-rated health (95% CI [- 0.064, - 0.008]). In order to improve the health of healthcare workers, administrators should balance effort and reward and provide opportunities for career development and training. In addition, health managers should help healthcare workers realize the significance and value of their work and keep them actively devoted to their work through incentive mechanisms."

Distributions of working hour characteristics were examined by schedules (e.g., permanent day, day/night) and demographics, and were cross-classified in a matrix to examine co-occurrence. Approximately 55% of shifts may cause circadian rhythm disruption as they were non-day shifts or day shifts with a quick return or rotation, or were 13 h or longer. Older workers, female workers, and White workers worked permanent day shifts most often, while workers of color worked more day/night schedules. Night and evening shifts had more frequent shift rotations, quick returns, and longer hours than day shifts. Yet, day shifts, which are presumed to have little negative circadian impact, may cause circadian rhythm disruption as long hours, quick returns and rotations also occurred within day shifts."

The use of 12-hour shifts has been considered beneficial in reducing staffing costs, attracting more nurses, improving work-life balance, and organizing care more efficiently. The aim of this review is to critically examine the available evidence on the impact of 12-hour shifts on nurse, patient, and organizational outcomes. A critical review of the literature was undertaken. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies analyzing the effect of long shifts (>12 working hours) were included. The search was performed on MEDLINE through PubMed and Cinhal. Fifty-four articles were included, covering publications from 1976 to 2024. Evidence suggests that nursing care and patient safety may deteriorate with 12-hour shifts, with mixed findings on continuity of care. 12-hour shifts can lead to increased nurses' fatigue, without a decrease in job performance, and can have negative impacts on physical health, continuing education, burnout, and job satisfaction. While qualitative studies indicate improved work-life balance, this is not supported by empirical evidence. One study suggests a decrease in costs, but the effects on sick leave are inconclusive. Additionally, intention-to-leave among nurses appears to increase. The evidence generally does not support the use of 12-hour shifts. However, due to methodological limitations in the included studies, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Organizations and nurses should carefully consider the introduction of 12-hour shifts, evaluating nurses' needs and implementing patient-centered care models that support nursing professionalism, along with a continuous monitoring of patient, nurse, and organizational outcomes."

Adopting a systems approach, this study investigated the relationship between multiple interrelated factors (train drivers' schedule, sleep, wellbeing, and fatigue) and the perceived influence of these factors on train driving performance and safety using an online survey distributed in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to demographics and work schedule, passenger and freight train drivers (n = 751) answered questions about: (1) Sleep duration; (2) wellbeing, including physical and mental health, the extent to which shiftwork causes sleep, social, domestic, and work problems, and (3) the extent to which ten fatigue, health and wellbeing factors in the work and home environment negatively impact their driving performance. The key factor that emerged from analyses, with the largest and most consistent negative effects (and controlling for other factors) was schedule irregularity. Approved rosters were ranked as having the most important impact on day-to-day driving performance, followed by physical and mental health, and outside work factors. Results also suggested that schedule irregularity may amplify the negative impacts of the roster, impaired physical and mental health, and outside work factors on driving performance. As shift variability and schedule irregularity are often poorly represented in existing industry guidance, these results provide evidence for increased reflection on current fatigue management guidelines for train drivers and suggest a need for greater focus on schedule irregularity through the lens of a systems approach."

Hospitals are at the forefront of COVID-19 prevention and control, and nurses are the main force on the frontline of the epidemic. Nursing shift is one of the most relevant and pressing issues for frontline nurses. However, there is a lack of national, large-sample surveys on scheduling and adverse nursing outcomes in COVID-19-designated hospitals. Using a cross-sectional online survey, we used nurse-reported data to measure the characteristics of the work setting, samples and work schedule. A descriptive analysis was performed to assess the shift status and adverse outcomes of designated hospitals and frontline nurses. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between them. Basic data were collected from 217 departments of 69 COVID-19-designated hospitals in 31 provinces in China. Nurses in the severe isolation ward worked mainly for 4 h per shift, whereas those in the fever clinic and observation ward worked mainly for 6-8 h. Half of the nurses had only 1 day of rest per week. Long working hours, lack of adequate rest time and overtime can seriously affect the quality and safety of nurses' work, resulting in adverse outcomes. Frontline nurses hope that scheduling guarantees the time to rest while ensuring fairness. The current evidence showed that frontline nurses were faced with long working hours, insufficient rest and overtime, which has a negative impact on nurse satisfaction, physical and mental health and quality of care. The government, hospitals and administrators still face many problems to overcome in their nursing schedules. Governments and hospitals should take these factors, such as the work setting characteristics and demographic features of the frontline nurses, into account when selecting nurses to fight COVID-19. Nurses have different working hours in different types of coronavirus unit; therefore, nursing managers should consider the working environment and nursing schedule needs, and in the future, we should pay attention to the fairness of nurses while ensuring their rest."

These are also likely to affect some allied healthcare professionals such as interventional radiologists. Problems from WMSDs include pain, diminished technical and cognitive performance, and work absence. These could contribute to burnout, to which surgeons are already vulnerable owing to other working practices such as shift patterns and long hours. WMSDs could negatively affect working performance, and lead to poorer surgical outcomes and patient care. Surgeons are at risk of WMSDs of the neck and back that result from fixed and damaging postures while operating. Some have reduced their operation numbers and working days as result of WMSDs. Theatre ergonomics (e.g. table positioning, operating stools and monitors), intraoperative breaks and stretching may improve WMSDs for some. Strength/resistance training (RT) may be used to prevent or mitigate WMSDs. RT can also enhance general health and concentration, and combat intraoperative fatigue. Low engagement times of moderate-intensity RT of 20 minutes, twice a week, improve neck and back pain from WMSDs. Moreover, RT has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by up to 15%, increase bone density, improve proprioception and reduce the fear of movement due to pain. Alongside ergonomic improvement and stretching, we recommend RT as an activity to improve general health and WMSDs."

Our findings indicated that there was a high risk to the mental health and well-being of families of healthcare workers both before and during the pandemic. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, some experiences and mental health issues of families were worsened. There was also a negative association between working long hours/shift work and family relationships/communication, family social life, and joint activities, and family members taking on more domestic responsibilities. Families tended to use both positive and negative coping strategies to deal with their loved one's job stress. Organisations and support services working with people in health care work should consider widening support to families where possible. With this understanding, HCWs and their families could be supported more effectively in clinical and organisational settings.

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers who are on the front line of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are also undergoing shift schedules face long work hours with few pauses, experience desynchronization of their circadian rhythm, and an imbalance between work hours effort and reward in saving lives, resulting in an impact on work capacity, aggravated by the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), few resources and precarious infrastructure, and fear of contracting the virus and contaminating family members. Some consequences are sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, stress-related sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These sleep alterations critically affect mental health, precipitating or perpetuating anxiety, stress, and depression, resulting in the inability to regulate positive and negative emotions. Pre-existing sleep disorders are an important risk factor for the development and maintenance of PSTD when individuals are exposed to an important stressor such as a COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, how an individual regulates the emotion associated with worries during daytime functioning impacts nighttime sleep, precipitating and perpetuating difficulties in sleeping. All of these changes in sleep and emotional regulation also alter the immune system. Sleep deprivation is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, due to the desynchronizations in circadian rhythms, causing possible psychophysiological disorders and impaired neuroimmune-endocrine homeostasis. From this perspective, we clarify in this article how sleep disorders affect the immune system and emotional regulation, explaining their phenomenological and neurobiological mechanisms, and discussing elements of cognitive and behavioral coping for health professionals to adopt and manage a healthier sleep pattern in the COVID-19 outbreak."

This indicated that fatigue was widespread, with significant impact on trainees' health and well-being. Consultants deliver an increasing proportion of patient care resulting in long periods of continuous daytime duty and overnight on-call work, so we wished to investigate their experience of out-of-hours working and the causes and impact of work-related fatigue. We conducted a national survey of consultant anaesthetists and paediatric intensivists in the UK and Ireland between 25 June and 6 August 2018. The response rate was 46% (94% of hospitals were represented): 84% of respondents (95%CI 83.1-84.9%) contribute to a night on-call rota with 32% (30.9-33.1%) working 1:8 or more frequently. Sleep disturbance on-call is common: 47% (45.6-48.4%) typically receive two to three phone calls overnight, and 48% (46.6-49.4%) take 30 min or more to fall back to sleep. Only 15% (14.0-16.0%) reported always achieving 11 h of rest between their on-call and their next clinical duty, as stipulated by the European Working Time Directive. Moreover, 24% (22.8-25.2%) stated that there is no departmental arrangement for covering scheduled clinical duties following a night on-call if they have been in the hospital overnight. Overall, 91% (90.3-91.7%) reported work-related fatigue with over half reporting a moderate or significantly negative impact on health, well-being and home life. We discuss potential explanations for these results and ways to mitigate the effects of fatigue among consultants."

        "abstract": "Flexible working time arrangements (FWTA) have increased over the last decades, favored by labor market deregulation, the decentralization of collective bargaining and the development of new technologies. The negative impact of some non-standard working hours on health (like night work, shift work) is quite well-known but other forms of FWTA have been studied less so far. This article aims to investigate the relationship between FWTA and workers' health. It focuses on employer-oriented FWTA and uses a job demands-control framework to identify different types of working time demands and control. The study uses individual data from the French working conditions survey, including panel data from 2013 to 2019 (64,981 observations) and cross-sectional employer-employee linked data from 2019 (5687 employees from 4672 workplaces). We identify empirically two main dimensions of employer-oriented FWTA, based on 14 working time variables. The first type involves \"atypical working hours\", such as working weekends, nights, early mornings, evenings, or doing shift work. The second type - \"work overflow\" - is characterized by long working hours, overtime, taking work home, and having variable working hours. Using a fixed-effects model based on panel data, we show that both types of FWTA have a negative impact on workers' self-rated general health and mental health, as measured by the WHO-5 index. The study also finds that workers who have more control - both individual and collective - to face these demands demonstrate better health. Workers with control over their working hours report better health and are less negatively affected by FWTA. Moreover, workplace-level practices have ambiguous relationships with workers' health. However, those involving social dialogue and workers' participation have more favorable effects: the positive effect of health and safety committees is especially clear. To improve workers' health in the context of increased flexible working time arrangements, public policies should promote the development of control over working time and participation of workers to social dialogue on working time related issues."

This qualitative study sought to understand worker perspectives on the health and well-being impacts of NSWSs among full-time, transportation maintainers, correctional, and manufacturing workers. Forty-nine workers participated in 8 focus groups. Data were transcribed and analyzed with ATLAS.ti, using the constant comparative method to identify themes and sub-themes. Workers reported that long work hours and irregular and unpredictable schedules posed the biggest obstacles to their well-being. Workers reported that NSWSs were associated with behavior impacts (poor family and social connections, poor eating, poor sleep, lack of exercise recovery), physical health impacts (exhaustion, weight gain) and extended work exposures (increased stress, increased accidents). This highlights the importance of developing and implementing effective workplace interventions to address these barriers to health and health behaviors."

        "abstract": "Physician burnout is a serious and growing threat to the medical profession and may undermine efforts to maintain a sufficient physician workforce to care for the growing and aging patient population in the United States. Burnout involves a host of complex underlying associations and potential for risk. While prevalence is unknown, recent estimates of physician burnout are quite high, approaching 50% or more, with midcareer physicians at highest risk. Sleep deprivation due to shift-work schedules, high workload, long hours, sleep interruptions, and insufficient recovery sleep have been implicated in the genesis and perpetuation of burnout. Maladaptive attitudes regarding sleep and endurance also may increase the risk for sleep deprivation among attending physicians. While duty-hour restrictions have been instituted to protect sleep opportunity among trainees, virtually no such effort has been made for attending physicians who have completed their training or practicing physicians in nonacademic settings. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that a critical need exists to evaluate the roles of sleep disruption, sleep deprivation, and circadian misalignment in physician well-being and burnout. Such evaluation may pave the way for the development of effective countermeasures that promote healthy sleep, with the goal of reducing burnout and its negative impacts such as a shrinking physician workforce, poor physician health and functional outcomes, lower quality of care, and compromised patient safety."

Female doctors (vs. males) were less likely to be a thoracic surgeon (13.8% vs. 34.5%, In conclusion, our findings revealed that exposure to gender discrimination in work life was more commonly expressed by female members of TTS, particularly in terms of burden of social roles, career advancement options and leadership positions, along with significant role of discriminatory, negative and dissuasive attitudes of male physicians in their career choice.

The present study aimed to identify the contextual factors associated with self-reported burnout rates among French psychiatrists. A total of 860 French or French-speaking psychiatrists completed an online questionnaire when they registered for a major psychiatric conference. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, a validated scale that independently appraises personal, work- and patient-related dimensions, was used to assess the degree of perceived burnout. Respondents were divided into lower risk and higher risk groups. The latter contained the 25% of individuals who scored the highest on each of the three dimensions of the CBI scale. Univariate analysis showed that private practice was associated with lower levels of risk on the personal and work-related dimensions. Working for the public sector and long hours were both associated with a higher score on the work-related dimension. Interestingly, none of the variables we investigated, except from poor atmosphere at work, correlated with the patient-related dimension. Among public-sector psychiatrists, female gender, longer hours, and more consultations per week were associated with a higher score on the work-related dimension. Working four or more night shifts per month was significantly associated with a higher score of burnout risk on all three dimensions. Private- and public-sector practitioners who mainly treated patients with schizophrenia had a higher score of burnout risk. Multivariate analysis showed that a poor atmosphere at work, longer hours, and working four or more night shifts were significantly associated with higher score of burnout risk. A nonreassuring working environment and more stressors while treating patients each had a possibly negative impact.

This study aims to examine the relationship between commuting time and musculoskeletal pain (back, upper extremity, and lower extremity pain), in the context of working time. This cross-sectional study used data from the Sixth Korean Working Conditions Survey conducted in Korea between October 2020 and April 2021. Variables such as commuting time, weekly working hours, and shift work were assessed using the survey questions. Musculoskeletal pain was determined based on self-reported pains in the previous year. The covariates included demographics, employment status, ergonomic risks, and job stress. The association between commuting time and musculoskeletal pain stratified by weekly working hours or shift work was analyzed by survey-weighted logistic regression analysis. This study found a significant association between longer commuting times and increased prevalence of musculoskeletal pain, particularly back, upper extremity, and lower extremity pain. When commuting time was ≤60, 61-120, >120 minutes, the odds ratio was 1.00, 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.52), and 2.41 (95% CI: 1.77-3.29) for back pain; 1.00, 1.29 (95% CI: 1.13-1.46), and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.71-3.00) for upper extremity pain; and 1.00, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.05-1.45), and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.13-2.08) for lower extremity pain, respectively. Furthermore, except for upper extremity pain, this trend was amplified when participants were concurrently exposed to long working hours, and for lower extremity pain, this trend was aggravated among shift workers. Long commuting time may be a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain, and its' effects could be aggravated when combined with long working hours or shift work. This study observed the detrimental impact of prolonged commuting on musculoskeletal health, particularly among employees with extended working hours or shift work."

        "abstract": "Shift work can be demanding owing to disturbances in the biological and social rhythms. This can cause short-term negative effects in employees, such as increased fatigue and reduced alertness. A potential way to counteract these negative effects is to enhance employees' recovery from work during working hours. The aim of this study is to develop and implement an intervention that focuses on promoting \"on-job\" recovery of shift workers. This study is performed in 2 department units with shift workers at a multinational company in the steel industry. For each department, an intervention will be developed and implemented through an iterative process of user-centered design and evaluation. This approach consists of various sessions in which employees and a project group (ie, researchers, line managers, human resource managers, and occupational health experts) provide input on the intervention content and implementation. Intervention effects will be evaluated using pretest and posttest web-based surveys. Digital ecological momentary assessment will be performed to gain insight into the link between the intervention and daily within-person processes. The intervention process and participants' perception of the interventions will be assessed through a process evaluation. Intervention results will be analyzed by performing mixed model repeated measures analyses and multilevel analyses. This study is supported by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research Work and Health Research Program, which is funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and supported by the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, program number 19.204.1-3. This study was approved by the institutional review board on February 7, 2019. From June to August 2019, baseline data were collected, and from November to December 2019, the first follow-up data were collected. The second follow-up data collection and data analysis are planned for the first two quarters of 2020. Dissemination of the results is planned for the last two quarters of 2020. A strength of this study design is the participatory action approach to enhance the stakeholder commitments, intervention adherence, and compliance. Moreover, since the target group will be participating in the development and implementation of the intervention, the proposed impact will be high. In addition, the short-term as well as the long-term effects will be evaluated. Finally, this study uses a unique combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. A limitation of this study is that it is impossible to randomly assign participants to an intervention or control group. Furthermore, the follow-up period (6 months) might be too short to establish health-related effects. Lastly, the results of this study might be specific to the department, organization, or sector, which limits the generalizability of the findings. However, as workplace intervention research for shift workers is scarce, this study might serve as a starting point for future research on shift work interventions."

        "abstract": "Critical care nurses are vulnerable to depression, which not only lead to poor well-being and increased turnover intention, but also affect their working performances and organizational productivity as well. Work related factors are important drivers of depressive symptoms. However, the non-liner and multi-directional relationships between job demands-resources and depressive symptoms in critical care nurses has not been adequately analyzed. Understanding these relationships would be helpful for reducing depression, increasing nurses' well-being and retain healthcare forces. This was a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the Nurses' mental health study (NMHS), a prospective cohort study on nurses from 67 tertiary hospitals in 31 province-level administrative regions in China. Only clinical nurses working in the ICU were included (n = 13,745). Data were collected using online questionnaires, and analyzed using network analysis and structural equation model. Job demands (average working hours per week, average number of night shifts per month, paperwork burden and work-life balance), job resources (supervisor support, co-worker support, leader justice, organizational climate satisfaction, work meaning, and career prospect), personal resource (resilience) and depressive symptoms were main variables in the networks, while demographic data and social health (social-emotional support and loneliness) were covariates. The prevalence of severe, moderately severe, moderate, mild, and none or minimum depressive symptoms in critical care nurses of this study were 1.21, 3.42, 9.76, 42.88, and 42.07% respectively. In the final network, 132 of 210 possible edges (62.8%) were not zero. \"Fatigue\" had the highest expected influence, followed by \"Motor\", and \"Appetite\". Meanwhile, in terms of job demands-resources and personal resources, the node with the highest expected influence was \"Supervisor support\", followed by \"Work meaning\" and \"Co-worker support\". Three bridge variables were identified: \"Resilience-adaptation\", \"Average working hours per week\", and \"Co-worker support\". The final structural equation model basically supported the results of network analysis with an acceptable model-fit (GFI = 0.918, AGFI = 0.896, PCFI = 0.789, PNFI = 0.788, NFI = 0.909, IFI = 0.911, CFI = 0.911, SRMR = 0.040, and RMSEA = 0.064). There was a rather strong interconnectedness between depressive symptoms and job demands-resources. Fatigue, motor, and appetite were core depressive symptoms of critical care nurses. Close attention to those symptoms could help recognize depression in critical care nurses. Supervisor support, work meaning, and co-worker support played vital roles as job resources in reducing depression, while negative impact of long average working hours per week were more contagious. Resilience, as personal resources, could help mediate the associations between job demands-resources and depression. In clinical practice, it's recommended for nursing managers to (1) encourage critical care nurses to find their \"meaning in work\", (2) implement resilience enhancing programs for nurse, (3) build and maintain meaningful relationships with nurses and support them in daily work, and (4) create a harmonious and dedicated working environment where co-workers are willing to help and support each other. Improvements in those modifiable aspects could help reduce risk and prevent exacerbations of depressive symptoms in critical care nurses."

Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress. More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health. The government shall develop and implement national programs for occupational health and safety, prevent violence in the workplace, improve psychological well-being, and protect from physical and biological hazards to take care of the mental health of healthcare professionals during this pandemic."

        "abstract": "The working environment of truck drivers promotes unhealthy lifestyle behaviours including physical inactivity and poor dietary choices. This leads to high levels of chronic diseases and a reduced life expectancy compared to other occupational groups. However, little is known about how drivers in the UK perceive their working environment and how this affects their food choices. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of long-haul (8-10-hour shifts) truck drivers' needs regarding healthy food choices whilst on the road to better inform future health promotion programmes and policy needs. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, allowing an in-depth exploration of truck drivers' experiences. The interview guide was grounded within the COM-B model and theoretical domains framework. Audio recordings were anonymised and transcribed verbatim and data analysed using thematic analysis. Ten drivers (8 male) were interviewed with a mean age of 49 years (SD 9.7). Frequently mentioned barriers to healthy eating were limited availability of affordable healthy food options at truck stops, food storage limitations, and limited time for food preparation. Commonly reported facilitators to improve drivers' diet were flexible break times, shorter shifts, secure parking places and/or better-equipped vehicles. Limited availability of healthy food options, high costs, poor facilities within rest areas, long working hours/shifts, and lack of food storage and preparation time, negatively impacts UK truck drivers' eating behaviours. This study highlights that multi-component interventions targeting the individual, environment and policy, are ultimately needed to improve truck drivers' working conditions and health."

Methods A prospective one-year cluster randomized trial was conducted. Participants received an individualized workstation ergonomics intervention, combined with 12 weeks of either workplace neck-specific exercises or health promotion information. Health-related productivity at baseline, post-intervention and 12-months was measured with the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using multilevel mixed models. Results We recruited 763 office workers from 14 organizations and allocated them to 100 clusters. For the general population of office workers, monetized productivity loss at 12 months [AU$1464 (standard deviation [SD] 1318) versus AU$1563 (SD=1039); P=0.023]; and presenteeism at 12 months [2.0 (SD 1.2) versus 2.4 (SD 1.4); P=0.007] was lower in the exercise group compared to those in the health promotion information group. For office workers with neck pain, exercise participants had lower sickness absenteeism at 12 months compared to health promotion information participants [0.7 days (SD 1.0) versus 1.4 days (SD 3.1); P-=0.012], despite a short-term increase in sickness absenteeism post-intervention compared to baseline for the exercise group [1.2 days (SD 2.2) versus 0.6 days (SD 0.9); P<0.001]. Conclusion A workplace intervention combining ergonomics and neck-specific exercise offers possible benefits for sickness presenteeism and health-related productivity loss among a general population of office workers and sickness absenteeism for office workers with neck pain in the longer-term."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers is high. Interventions that promote occupational standing or walking have been found to reduce occupational sedentary time, but it is unclear whether these interventions ameliorate musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers. To investigate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, OSH UPDATE, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to January 2019. We also screened reference lists of primary studies and contacted experts to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), quasi RCTs, and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies of interventions to reduce or break up workplace sitting by encouraging standing or walking in the workplace among workers with musculoskeletal symptoms. The primary outcome was self-reported intensity or presence of musculoskeletal symptoms by body region and the impact of musculoskeletal symptoms such as pain-related disability. We considered work performance and productivity, sickness absenteeism, and adverse events such as venous disorders or perinatal complications as secondary outcomes. Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for study eligibility. These review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to request additional data when required. We used GRADE considerations to assess the quality of evidence provided by studies that contributed to the meta-analyses. We found ten studies including three RCTs, five cluster RCTs, and two CBA studies with a total of 955 participants, all from high-income countries. Interventions targeted changes to the physical work environment such as provision of sit-stand or treadmill workstations (four studies), an activity tracker (two studies) for use in individual approaches, and multi-component interventions (five studies). We did not find any studies that specifically targeted only the organisational level components. Two studies assessed pain-related disability. Physical work environment There was no significant difference in the intensity of low back symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.80 to 0.10; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) nor in the intensity of upper back symptoms (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -.096 to 0.00; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) in the short term (less than six months) for interventions using sit-stand workstations compared to no intervention. No studies examined discomfort outcomes at medium (six to less than 12 months) or long term (12 months and more). No significant reduction in pain-related disability was noted when a sit-stand workstation was used compared to when no intervention was provided in the medium term (mean difference (MD) -0.4, 95% CI -2.70 to 1.90; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). Individual approach There was no significant difference in the intensity or presence of low back symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.77; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.78; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), or elbow/wrist and hand symptoms (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions involving an activity tracker compared to an alternative intervention or no intervention in the short term. No studies provided outcomes at medium term, and only one study examined outcomes at long term. Organisational level No studies evaluated the effects of interventions solely targeted at the organisational level. Multi-component approach There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.27; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.80; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the short term. Only one RCT examined outcomes at medium term and found no significant difference in low back symptoms (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.95 to 1.15; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (MD -0.70, 95% CI -2.12 to 0.72; low-quality evidence), and leg symptoms (MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.49 to 0.89; low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.40; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; two RCTs; low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the long term. There was a statistically significant reduction in pain-related disability following a multi-component intervention compared to no intervention in the medium term (MD -8.80, 95% CI -17.46 to -0.14; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). Currently available limited evidence does not show that interventions to increase standing or walking in the workplace reduced musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers at short-, medium-, or long-term follow up. The quality of evidence is low or very low, largely due to study design and small sample sizes. Although the results of this review are not statistically significant, some interventions targeting the physical work environment are suggestive of an intervention effect. Therefore, in the future, larger cluster-RCTs recruiting participants with baseline musculoskeletal symptoms and long-term outcomes are needed to determine whether interventions to increase standing or walking can reduce musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers and can be sustained over time."

Online occupational safety and health training is one of the most effective preventive interventions. This study aims to present current knowledge on e-training interventions, make recommendations on the flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of online training, and identify research gaps and obstacles. All studies that addressed occupational safety and health e-training interventions designed to address worker injuries, accidents, and diseases were chosen from PubMed and Scopus until 2021. Two independent reviewers conducted the screening process for titles, abstracts, and full texts, and disagreements on the inclusion or exclusion of an article were resolved by consensus and, if necessary, by a third reviewer. The included articles were analyzed and synthesized using the constant comparative analysis method. The search identified 7,497 articles and 7,325 unique records. Following the title, abstract, and full-text screening, 25 studies met the review criteria. Of the 25 studies, 23 were conducted in developed and two in developing countries. The interventions were carried out on either the mobile platform, the website platform, or both. The study designs and the number of outcomes of the interventions varied significantly (multi-outcomes vs. single-outcome). Obesity, hypertension, neck/shoulder pain, office ergonomics issues, sedentary behaviors, heart disease, physical inactivity, dairy farm injuries, nutrition, respiratory problems, and diabetes were all addressed in the articles. According to the findings of this literature study, e-trainings can significantly improve occupational safety and health. E-training is adaptable, affordable, and can increase workers' knowledge and abilities, resulting in fewer workplace injuries and accidents. Furthermore, e-training platforms can assist businesses in tracking employee development and ensuring that training needs are completed. Overall, this analysis reveals that e-training has enormous promise in the field of occupational safety and health for both businesses and employees."

Little is known about the working conditions at home and its impact on the employee's occupational health. This systematic review examines the working conditions at employees' homes, the work-related disorders associated with working from home, organizations' perceptions of ergonomics at home and how they support their teleworkers. A search of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Open Grey, Pedro, PsychInfo, PubPsych, Scopus and Web of Science) was performed. Twelve studies were included in this review. The findings highlight the lack of ergonomic working conditions for home-based teleworkers. Furthermore, the results underline organizations' lack of awareness regarding home-based policies, ergonomics programs and the health-related consequences associated with the absence of ergonomic support. These findings suggest that home-based teleworkers have increased health risks. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that most of the included studies reported teleworkers who have experienced musculoskeletal issues. These results underline the necessity for implementing ergonomic design recommendations, especially for working at home. Further research is needed to understand the impact of ergonomics programs and workplace design for working at home."

        "abstract": "As the commercial cannabis industry grows, there is an increased need to characterize potentially hazardous workplace exposures and provide training to workers to mitigate these exposures with the goal of reducing accidents and injuries from cannabis cultivation, processing, and manufacturing. Public health and safety stakeholders in Colorado developed a worker-focused training designed to improve hazard awareness, recognition, and controls related to commercial cannabis cultivation. This paper describes the evaluation of this training. The training was a full day, in-person educational experience directed to workers in the cannabis cultivation industry. Training topics included an overview of occupational safety and health hazards, chemical exposures, slip, trips, and falls, repetitive motion, the application of the hierarchy of control including lockout/tagout, machine guarding, personal protective equipment, among others. Evaluation surveys assessed attendee demographics, perceived job hazards, confidence to change workplace practices, knowledge, training relevancy and quality, intent to change behavior, as well as barriers and resources. A total of 208 people attended the safety trainings. One hundred and thirty-four participants (64%) completed the pre-training survey and 107 (51%) completed the post-training survey. Respondents provided high ratings for the quality and relevance of the training, with 91.3% of respondents rating the training very good or excellent. Before the training, the attendees listed their most concerning safety and health issues as exposure to pesticides and other chemicals (65.7%), absorbing chemicals through the skin (56.7%), slips, trips, and falls (52.2%), and respiratory hazards (50.7%). After the training, they reported the most concerning hazards to be slips, trips, and fall hazards (65.4%), ergonomic problems (64.5%), and respiratory issues (61.7%). There was a statistically non-significant increase in knowledge scores from 67.1% correct to 76.0% correct. Finally, 88.5% of respondents felt extremely or very confident that they could change their own health and safety practices at work. The training successfully reached cannabis employees in cultivation, compliance, and management. Survey respondents felt that the training was of high quality and addressed gaps in their knowledge related to safety and health hazards in the cannabis industry. The workplace safety and health concerns shifted from pre- to post-training. There was a statistically non-significant increase in knowledge. Additional follow-up of training attendees would be beneficial to measure sustained impact of training."

This new context has an impact on the work environment and workers. Nevertheless, these impacts are still inconclusive and controversial, requiring new investigative perspectives. This study aimed to investigate the requirements sought, the risk factors identified, and the adverse effects on workers caused by the characteristics of I4.0. The methodology was based on a systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA protocol, and 30 articles were found eligible. A descriptive and bibliometric analysis of these studies was performed. The results identified the main topics that emerged and have implications for workers' Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and divided them into categories. The requirements are related mainly to cognitive, organizational, and technological demands. The most significant risk factors generated were associated with the psychosocial ones, but organizational, technological, and occupational factors were also identified. The adverse effects cited were categorized as psychic, cognitive, physical, and organizational; stress was the most cited effect. An explanatory theoretical model of interaction was proposed to represent the pathway of causal relations between the requirements and risk factors for the effects caused by I4.0. This review has found just how complex the relationships between the principles of Industry 4.0 are (e.g., requirements, risk factors, and effects) and the human factors. It also suggests a pathway for how these relationships occur, bridging the gap left by the limited studies focused on connecting these topics. These results can help organizational managers understand the impacts of I4.0 on workers' safety and health."

The study included 20 nursing workers of both genders with an average of 17.33±12.58 years of work experience. The most reported problematic factors were: lack of material, staff pressure, patient transporting, employment legal status with the institution, and lack of communication among the practitioners. There was a physical effort during the activity and a high prevalence of workers with pain complaints, which justifies the investigation."

This systematic review of studies explores the causes and consequences of interruptions in the ED. Of 2836 abstract/titles screened, 137 full-text articles were reviewed, and 44 articles met inclusion criteria of measuring ED interruptions. All articles reported primary data collection, and most were cohort studies (n = 30, 68%). Conceptual or operational definitions of interruptions were included in 27 articles. Direct observation was the most common approach. In half of the studies, quantitative measures of interruptions in the ED were descriptive only, without measurements of interruptions' consequences. Twenty-two studies evaluated consequences, including workload, delays, satisfaction, and errors. Overall, relationships between ED interruptions and their causes and consequences are primarily derived from direct observation within large academic hospitals using heterogeneous definitions. Collective strengths of interruptions research in the ED include structured methods of naturalistic observation and definitions of interruptions derived from concept analysis. Limitations are conflicting and complex evaluations of consequences attributed to interruptions, including the predominance of descriptive reports characterizing interruptions without direct measurements of consequences. The use of standardized definitions and measurements in interruptions research could contribute to measuring the impact and influence of interruptions on clinicians' productivity and efficiency as well as patients' outcomes, and thus provide a basis for intervention research."

        "abstract": "Employees of shopping malls face various physiological and psychological health problems due to their specific working conditions. The purpose of this descriptive study was to evaluate the ergonomic risk factors for employees (N=222) from three shopping centres in the city of Erzurum, Turkey. We wanted to learn more about the attitudes of the shopping mall employees regarding their current working conditions, which we hoped would help us propose measures for the elimination or reduction of the most prominent ergonomic risk factors. Data were collected between May 1 and July 1, 2022 using our own questionnaire, which consisted of questions regarding personal characteristics (gender, age, education level, marital status, working year, unit, working position, nature of the job, presence of chronic disease, etc.) and the Workplace Ergonomics Scale, which consists of 32 items divided into 6 sub-dimensions (Occupational Health and Safety, Environmental Conditions, Psychological Elements, Employee Safety, Workplace Social Environment, and Working Environment). The obtained results indicated that the majority of employees were young, healthy, high school graduates mainly working as sales consultants. Their average income was low, their working hours were long, and they found their rest periods shorter than needed. The study found that, although shopping centre employees rated their work environment as low risk in terms of ergonomics, their scores on the workplace ergonomics scale were above average. The results of this study could contribute to a better understanding and identification of ergonomic risks in the trade sector and serve for planning future prevention strategies. Zaposlenici trgovačkih centara suočeni su s raznim fiziološkim i psihološkim poteškoćama zbog specifičnih uvjeta njihova posla. Svrha ovoga istraživanja bila je procijeniti ergonomske faktore rizika za zaposlenike (N=222) triju trgovačkih centara u gradu Erzurum, Turska. Namjera nam je bila prikupiti podatke o stavovima zaposlenika spram njihovih trenutačnih uvjeta na radu, koji bi mogli poslužiti za osmišljavanje mjera otklanjanja ili umanjenja najistaknutijih ergonomskih faktora rizika. Podaci su prikupljani u razdoblju od 1. svibnja do 1. srpnja 2022. koristeći samostalno kreirani upitnik, koji je sadržavao pitanja vezana uz osobne značajke (spol, dob, razina obrazovanja, bračni status, godina zaposlenja, jedinica, radno mjesto, priroda posla, kronične bolesti, itd.) i ljestvicu ergonomije na radnom mjestu, koja se sastoji od 32 stavke podijeljene u šest poddimenzija (zdravlje i sigurnost na radu, okolišni uvjeti, psihološki čimbenici, sigurnost zaposlenika, društveno okruženje na radnom mjestu i radno okruženje). Rezultati pokazuju da je većina zaposlenika bila mlađe dobi, odličnog zdravstvenog stanja, imala srednjoškolsku razinu obrazovanja i radila kao prodavači. Njihov je prosječni prihod bio nizak, radno vrijeme dugo, a vrijeme dozvoljeno za odmor smatrali su prekratkim. Naše istraživanje je pokazalo da, iako su ispitanici ocijenili svoje radno okruženje niskorizičnim u smislu ergonomije, njihovi rezultati na ljestvici bili su natprosječno visoki. Rezultati ovoga istraživanja mogli bi pridonijeti boljem razumijevanja i definiranju ergonomskih rizika u sektoru trgovine i poslužiti za planiranje boljih strategija za njihovu prevenciju."

The transition to new work arrangements which involve a hybrid, work and home model, is likely to involve the use of alternative workspaces. Understanding the impacts of CWS on employees is timely to examine the benefits of utilisation and how these might be incorporated into new ways of working. This scoping review aims to explore the relationship between CWS, mental and physical health, and workers' performance, and provide insights into future considerations for design. The main objective was to map the current literature on CWS, focusing on identification of relevant modifiable factors to improve worker's mental and physical health, and performance. Three databases, Embase, PsycInfo, and Proquest, were systematically reviewed, to identify studies from 2005 onwards. Data was extracted and analysed using diagrammatic mapping. Only studies published in English were included. Eleven relevant papers were included which covered the three outcomes of interest: worker's performance (5), mental health (4) and physical health (2). Environmental factors influencing the three outcomes were categorised into physical environment (12 factors) and the psychosocial environment (6 factors). Overall, CWS environmental factors had a positive influence on workers (23 positive relationships and 11 negative relationships). Coworking spaces offer potential benefits for tele-workers, including opportunities for collaboration/networking and productivity gains. However, attention to the CWS physical design is important to optimise the experience for workers and mitigate risk of adverse mental and physical health effects."

This systematic review explored the effectiveness of workplace-based interventions on knee pain among workers. A PICO-guided systematic search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for articles published from 2003 until January 2023. Eligible articles included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of workplace-based interventions on knee pain among currently employed adult workers. The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the systematic review approach, which the Institute for Work & Health developed, and was focused on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Of the 13 identified studies, 11 medium- and high-quality studies were entered into the evidence synthesis. Importantly, none of the included studies specifically aimed at reducing of knee pain. Still, among the included studies, a strong level of evidence suggested no benefit of workplace-based physical exercise/activity intervention on knee pain. The level of evidence was deemed too uncertain to guide current policy/practices for ergonomic and multifaceted interventions. No intervention types were associated with negative effects on knee pain. The current evidence-base pertaining to workplace-based prevention and management of knee pain is insufficient to guide effective preventive workplace practice or policy development. Considering the global prevalence and health impact of knee pain, development and implementation of effective workplace interventions aimed at prevention and management of knee pain is needed."

As the global community seeks to contend with even hotter weather in the future as a consequence of global climate change, there is a pressing need to better understand the most effective prevention and response measures that can be implemented, particularly in low-resource settings. In this Series paper, we describe how a future reliance on air conditioning is unsustainable and further marginalises the communities most vulnerable to the heat. We then show that a more holistic understanding of the thermal environment at the landscape and urban, building, and individual scales supports the identification of numerous sustainable opportunities to keep people cooler. We summarise the benefits (eg, effectiveness) and limitations of each identified cooling strategy, and recommend optimal interventions for settings such as aged care homes, slums, workplaces, mass gatherings, refugee camps, and playing sport. The integration of this information into well communicated heat action plans with robust surveillance and monitoring is essential for reducing the adverse health consequences of current and future extreme heat."

        "abstract": "Millions of workers globally experience work-related injuries, leading to fatalities, injuries, job loss, and wider societal implications. This study utilizes both the U.S. database and the General Social Survey (GSS) to delve into the factors linked to occupational injuries. In this study, 30 questions from the GSS between 2002 and 2014 were used. The sample included 5,914 workers from various sectors, distributed between both female and male, and were of 18 years and above. The analysis encompasses several dimensions: demographics, job-related characteristics, administrative factors, and health and safety measures. The study particularly focuses on assessing the prevalence of three common work-related injuries: nonfatal injuries, back pain and arm pain. Logistic regression models were constructed to gauge the effects of identified factors. Significant insights emerge from the analysis. Factors such as age, gender, race, working hours, overtime work, trust in management, coworker support, and workflow smoothness were identified as having notable impacts on work-related injuries. For each model, the study quantifies these impacts through odds ratio and relative effects. For example, in the nonfatal injuries model, the relative effects of age showed that workers aged 65 years or older experience a 2.56% decrease in the frequency of nonfatal injuries compared to younger workers. Furthermore, in the back pain model, the estimated odds of having back pain in males are 0.90 lower than that in females. Moreover, in the arm pain model, workers who have sufficient time to complete their tasks have estimated odds of experiencing arm pain that are 0.85 lower than those who don't have adequate time, etc. Conclusions: Understanding the intricate interplay of various factors influencing workers' safety and health is vital for addressing occupational injuries. By addressing these factors, there's potential for reducing work-related injuries, enhancing work environment, and minimizing costs. Organizations can use the study's findings for reducing work related injuries. Flexible work arrangements, tailored training programs, and ergonomic improvements might highlight factors such as age, gender, and working hours. Enhancing communication, fostering a positive work culture, and prioritizing safety and health measures could reduce risks associated with trusting management and coworker support. Cost-benefit analysis and continuous monitoring ensure these interventions' effectiveness, reduce back and hand pain incidents, minimize cost, and create safer workplaces, thereby boosting the overall well-being of workers and organizational success."

Using a 35-min online survey, we sought to understand how technology daily usage patterns, device types, and postures affect pain and discomfort to understand how knowledge of that pain might help students avoid it. Data were analyzed from 515 students (69.5% male) who completed an internet-delivered survey (81.3% response rate). Participants ranked smartphones as their most frequently used technology (64.0%), followed by laptops and tablets (both 53.2%), and desktop computers (46.4%). Time spent using smartphones averaged over 4.4 h per day. When using their devices, students were more likely to adopt non-traditional workplace postures as they used these devices primarily on the couch or at a chair with no desk. Recent trends in wireless academic access points along with the portability of small handheld devices, have made smartphones the most common link to educational materials despite having the least favorable control and display scenario from an ergonomic perspective. Further, the potential impact of transitions in work environments due to COVID-19 may further exacerbate ergonomic issues among millions highlighting the need for such work to be carried out."

Many factors contribute to the degree of exposure experienced in this setting. The study objective was to characterize the impact of workplace conditions, anthropometric variability, and task orientation on exposure for a simulated routine operations task. A chemical exposure laboratory simulation study was designed to evaluate the dependent variable of chemical exposure level in the breathing zone for methane and sulfur hexafluoride. The independent variables were (i) posture of the worker, (ii) worker anthropometry, (iii) process configuration, and (iv) gas density. Pipe height was a significant predictor of gas concentration measured in the breathing zone when located in a position that encouraged the gas to enter the breathing zone of the worker. Worker anthropometry had a major impact; tall worker's (male) chemical concentrations exceeded those of the short worker (female) for methane simulations but the opposite resulted for sulfur hexafluoride. Also, worker posture had a significant impact on gas exposure where nonneutral postures were found to have higher levels of chemical concentration. The study findings indicate that the breathing zone location is altered by posture and worker height, which changes the exposures relative to the emission source depending on the gas density of the chemicals that are present. As a result, qualitative risk assessment cannot be performed accurately without accounting for these factors. Practically, controls may need to account for worker size differences and posture adaptations."

Workstation design has been reported to affect the physical and mental health of employees. However, while the functional effects of ergonomic workstations have been documented, there is little research on the influence of workstation design on the executive function of the brain. In this study, 23 healthy volunteers in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations completed the Montreal imaging stress task, while their brain activity was recorded using the synchronized measurement of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed desynchronization in alpha rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as decreased functional connectivity in the PFC networks at the non-ergonomic workstations. Additionally, a significant increase in salivary alpha-amylase activity was observed in all participants at the non-ergonomic workstations, confirming the presence of induced stress. These findings suggest that workstation design can significantly impact cognitive functioning and human capabilities at work. Therefore, the use of functional neuroimaging in workplace design can provide critical information on the causes of workplace-related stress."

It causes an unsafe and unpleasant working environment that directly impacts the quality of the product, workers' productivity, and effectiveness. This study aimed to give a specialized solution for tests and explore possible solutions to the given problem in neuroergonomics and human-robot interaction. The designed modular and adaptive laboratory model of the industrial assembly workstation represents the laboratory infrastructure for conducting advanced research in the field of ergonomics, neuroergonomics, and human-robot interaction. It meets the operator's anatomical, anthropometric, physiological, and biomechanical characteristics. Comparing standard, ergonomic, guided, and collaborative work will be possible based on workstation construction and integrated elements. These possibilities allow the industry to try, analyze, and get answers for an identified problem, the condition, habits, and behavior of operators in the workplace. The set-up includes a workstation with an industry work chair, a Poka-Yoke system, adequate lighting, an audio 5.0 system, containers with parts and tools, EEG devices (a cap and smartfones), an EMG device, touchscreen PC screen, and collaborative robot. The first phase of the neuroergonomic study was performed according to the most common industry tasks defined as manual, monotonous, and repetitive activities. Participants have a task to assemble the developed prototype model of an industrial product using prepared parts and elements, and instructed by the installed touchscreen PC. In the beginning, the participant gets all the necessary information about the experiment and gets 15 min of practice. After the introductory part, the EEG device is mounted and prepared for recording. The experiment starts with relaxing music for 5 min. The whole experiment lasts two sessions per 60 min each, with a 15 min break between the sessions. Based on the first experiments, it is possible to develop, construct, and conduct complex experiments for industrial purposes to improve the physical, cognitive, and organizational aspects and increase workers' productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It has highlighted the possibility of applying modular and adaptive ergonomic research laboratory experimental set-up to transform standard workplaces into the workplaces of the future."

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of two types of occupational footwear [steel-toed (SB) and tactical (TB) work boots] on human balance, when exposed to physical workload. Postural stability was evaluated in eighteen male participants in the following conditions: eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), eyes open unstable surface (EOU) and eyes closed unstable surface (ECU). Postural sway parameters were analyzed using a 2×3 repeated measures analysis of variance design [prior to (PRE) and twice post-workload (POST1 & POST2) separated by 10 minutes of rest]. Findings revealed that the use of SB resulted in greater postural stability, which could be attributed to the design characteristics of these footwear and that postural stability was negatively impacted immediately after the workload which could be attributed to the physical exertions during the workload. However, significant differences were limited to ECU with no visual and altered somatosensory feedback. Design features on occupational footwear can aid postural stability while physical exertional tasks can be detrimental. Findings can offer design and work-rest scheduling suggestions to improve work safety."

Given the lack of evidence of the background music influence on the cognitive factors in the work place in previous studies and the lack of study on the effect of background music on skill performance when gender and personality type is considered, research in this area seems necessary. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the influence of background music on cognitive and skill performance in the work place with regard to gender and personality type. This study was conducted with the participation of 52 students (26 males and 26 females) aged between 18-30 years old. Sustained attention, working memory, fine finger and gross manual dexterity skills and personality type were assessed. Participants were randomly tested once when being exposed to classical instrumental music and once again when faced with complete silenceRESULTS:Playing background music improved students working memory but had no significant effect on sustained attention. Music also improved skill performance.Overall, memory performance and fine finger dexterity were found significantly better in extroverts when compared to introverts during playing background music. Background music improves working memory and speeds up performance in skill tasks, however the role of personality type in influencing background music on cognitive and skill performance needs further investigation."

The purpose of this work was to examine the relationships between stress, coping, and psychological resilience and their effects on performance and learning in surgical training. A narrative review was carried out of the existing literature on stress, coping, and resilience in surgeons and surgical trainees. Multiple fields of study were examined including medical education, surgery, surgical safety, anesthesia, workplace ergonomics, and psychology. Sources of intraoperative stress include fatigue, disruptions, interpersonal conflicts, time pressure, a complex case or high risk patient, surgical errors, and surgeon temperament. These stressors can negatively impact the performance of surgeons and trainees and may inhibit learning. How a learner responds to stress in the operating room is highly variable and influenced by the context of the stress, the coping mechanisms available, and individual psychological resilience. Stress management techniques, such as mental rehearsal, are beneficial for reducing stress. Resilience is protective against stress and burnout, and resilience training is useful for reducing stress and improving mental health in physicians and medical students. Surgical trainees experience significant stress in the operating room and their experience of stress is modulated by cognitive and behavioral factors. Further research is required on the development of effective interventions to help trainees manage intraoperative stress, with the potential to improve surgical performance, learning, and patient safety."

Forty maritime pilots were recruited from Australian ports. Sleep wake-behaviour (timing and length), and self-reported sleep quality and fatigue, were assessed to determine any impact of roster status and 'on-call' status. On-roster pilots experienced reduced night time sleep duration compared to those off-roster (57 ± 8.8 min), while working on-call also diminished night time sleep duration (126 ± 11.3 min) and quality, compared to workers not on-call. Fatigue scores indicated that participants were not fully recovered prior to commencing rostered night shift, while sleep quality was significantly worse following sleep that occurred after a night shift, compared to after a day shift. These findings potentially support workplace negotiations to change future shift cycles, and to adopt monitoring systems that may mitigate the risk of fatigue-related accidents and chronic health outcomes."

However, there are limited studies in the literature examining the musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine musculoskeletal problems and psychological disorders in healthcare personnel working at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine and Research Hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and to come up with solutions for rehabilitation. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire (CMDQ) was used to assess musculoskeletal problems in the past week. Additionally, Beck depression inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate the psychological state of the participants. Questions on demographic characteristics, habits, the presence and localisation of musculoskeletal system (MSS) diseases, severity and duration of pain, chronic diseases, trauma history and working conditions were included in the questionnaire prepared by the researchers. The study included 74 nurses, 42 residents, 26 specialists, 24 technicians, 16 dentists, 12 physiotherapists, and 26 other allied health personnel. Dentists had the highest total CMDQ score (160.73) whereas resident doctors had the lowest total CMDQ score (98.33). Low back, neck and back pain were the most common MSS problems. BDI was highest in nurses and 70.27% of the nurses were women. The total workplace ergonomics score was found to be 25.91%, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) was highest in nurses (6.72). While MSS pain is concentrated on the waist, neck and back regions in all healthcare workers. We concluded that the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, delay in preventive measures such as vaccination and medication, rapid and strong transmission of the disease and increasing number of deaths have led to an increase in stress, depression and burnout among healthcare workers."

Gathering workers' experiences using lists, focus groups, or participatory ergonomics groups is necessary to identify the phenomenon. For risk assessment, spontaneous reporting of events is often insufficient. It may be complemented with two methods: systematic recording of violent events that occurred in the past year during periodic medical examinations of workers and targeted surveys. The epidemiological analysis of data from individual interviews and surveys provides the phenomenon's prevalence, incidence, and evolution. Moreover, reporting the harm suffered by victims of violence allows constructing impact matrices to allocate resources where they are most needed."

This study sought to characterize and quantify the impact COVID-19 related shutdowns had on perceptions of health and wellbeing, musculoskeletal discomfort, and physical characteristics of workstation set-up in full time workers who transitioned to working from home. 297 participants from 8 countries completed a retrospective pre/post survey design that assessed outcomes prior to COVID-19 shutdowns and when each participant was experiencing peak pandemic-related restrictions. There were 3 categories including, health and wellbeing, musculoskeletal discomfort, and workplace ergonomics. General discomfort on a scale from 1 to 100 increased from 31.4 pre to 39.9 during COVID-19. Notable areas increasing in severity of discomfort from pre to during included the neck (41.8 to 47.7), upper back (36.3 to 41.3) and right wrist (38.7 to 43.5). The percentage of the population experiencing discomfort increased from pre to during in the low back (41.5% to 55.2%), upper back (28.7% to 40.9%), neck (45.5% to 60.9%) and right wrist (16.1% to 23.7%). There were three distinct groups for physical activity one group including, one maintaining and one that decreased, which did not have an impact on perceived general discomfort. There was a significant decrease in usage of a desk and adjustable chair and an increase in laptop use. Working from home in some capacity will likely be a more common occurrence which will require further ergonomic assessments and considerations to keep a healthy workforce."

These well-documented occupational hazards have long been linked to heart disease. Exposures arising from these hazards present significant concerns for worker health and safety. Moreover, heat stress is an emerging and increasingly pervasive threat, exacerbated by climate change, particularly in outdoor, high-exposure industries like agriculture and construction. While the epidemiological links between heat and CVD are well established, there is a critical gap in research on the physiological impacts of heat on workers' cardiovascular health. In particular, migrant workers are especially vulnerable to these occupational hazards, particularly in the absence of targeted, equitable interventions. As global temperatures rise, addressing these occupational exposures is important for protecting the cardiovascular health of the workforce and the expanding field of occupational cardiology."

Musculoskeletal disorders, including trapezius myalgia, may be associated with repeated exposure to prolonged low-level activity, even during light upper-extremity tasks including computer work. Thirty healthy adults participated in a study that simulated two 6-hour workdays of computer work. One workday involved imposed periodic passive and active interventions aimed at disrupting trapezius contraction monotony (Intervention day), whereas the other workday did not (Control day). Trapezius muscle activity was quantified by the 3-dimensional acceleration of the jolt movement of the acromion produced by electrically induced muscle twitches. The spatio-temporal distribution of trapezius activity was measured through high-density surface electromyography (HD-EMG). The twitch acceleration magnitude in one direction was significantly different across measurement periods ( Disruption of trapezius monotonous activity via brief voluntary contractions effectively modified the ensuing contraction pattern (twitch acceleration along one axis, active epochs reduction, and larger spatial distribution). The observed changes support an associated reduction of muscle fatigue. This study suggests that disruptive intervention activity is efficient in reducing the impact of trapezius muscle fatigue."

Given the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such arrangements have risen substantially in a short timeframe. Work-from-home has been associated with several physical and mental health outcomes. This relationship has been supported by previous research; however, these health and safety issues often receive little resources and attention from business perspectives compared to organizational and worker performance and productivity. Therefore, aligning work-from-home practices with business goals may help catalyze awareness from decision makers and serve to effectively implement work-from-home policies. We conducted a review to synthesize current knowledge on the impact of work-from-home arrangements on personal and organizational performance and productivity. Four large databases including Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, and Business Source Complete were systematically searched. Through a two-step screening process, we selected and extracted data from 37 relevant articles. Key search terms surrounded two core concepts: work-from-home and productivity/performance. Of the articles published prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 79% (n = 19) demonstrated that work-from-home increased productivity and performance whereas 21% (n = 5) showed mixed or no effects. Of the articles published during the pandemic, 23% (n = 3) showed positive effects, 38% (n = 5) revealed mixed results, and 38% (n = 5) showed negative effects. Findings suggest that non-mandatory work-from-home arrangements can have positive impacts on productivity and performance. When work-from-home becomes mandatory and full-time, or external factors (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) are at play, the overall impacts are less positive and can be detrimental to productivity and performance. Results will help foster an understanding of the impact of work-from-home on productivity and performance and inform the development of organizational strategies to create an effective, resilient, and inclusive work-from-home workplace by helping to effectively implement work-from-home policies that are aligned with business goals."

Throughout Europe, work-related musculoskeletal disorders affect millions of workers, especially in the logistics sector, and cost employers billions of euros. This paper studies how order pickers relate the use of technology as well as their relationship with the logistics company to their well-being, health and productivity. To obtain data, a survey consisting of questions regarding work characteristics, health problems and the logistics company's relationship with employees was conducted in Poland, Slovenia and Croatia. Workers who carry most items manually experience more health problems than cart and forklift users. The most common complaint is lower back pain - only 6% of order pickers (n = 221) never experienced it. The use of barcode or RFID scanner/terminal/smart phone correlates with more health problems than the use of other technologies. Participation in the selection of transport means or in training on health preservation can reduce the perceived health problems. Workers' perception of the impact of the applied technology on health and productivity can differ from the impact that is calculated or measured. Through their relationship with employees, logistics companies can influence employees' perception of their health problems."

Data was collected via a questionnaire administered prior to the start of and during the study. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. All dentists self-reported to be in good to excellent health and only 50% sought medical treatment for work-related discomfort and pain. Thirteen of 14 reported being at least occasionally mentally and physically exhausted after work. A musculoskeletal disorder-work hour relationship model was created. Feedback given was linked to four psychosocial factors -job demand, job control, social interactions, and job future and career issues. The dental profession is considered a highly cognitive profession where much attention has been placed on the physical demands due to awkward postures. While physical demands are validated, additional research will further validate the link between psychosocial and mental and physical demands."

It is caused by screen-related, environmental, ergonomic, and physiological factors, affecting diverse demographics. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly amplified CVS due to increased screen time for remote work, online learning, and social media use, with studies reporting symptoms in up to 74% of individuals. Unique visual challenges from digital screens, including reduced clarity and glare, exacerbate symptoms like dry eyes and discomfort, especially in those with uncorrected vision. Understanding CVS is crucial for mitigating its impact through effective prevention and management strategies. This study explores the causes, diagnosis, management, and prevention strategies of CVS by synthesizing recent findings from optometry, occupational health, digital health, and ergonomics. It also highlights emerging trends such as AI, wearables, and augmented reality while providing practical management strategies. A narrative review of literature from 2014 to 2024 was conducted, focusing on PubMed-indexed, peer-reviewed articles, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews, with priority given to recent, highly cited studies."

We show how literature has been addressing different aspects of work (e.g., workers' health, working conditions, procedures, protection equipment, remote working, etc.) in the various economic sectors. We discuss the results in light of ergonomics and psychodynamics of work, two disciplines that conceive work and organization as intimately connected, and that can assist managers in meeting the difficulties brought by the pandemic. We highlight that considering the construction of health, interindividual variability, subjective relation to work, supportive workplace environment, and organizational and individual capabilities can play a key role in successfully adapting and transforming organizations in the current scenario."

We distributed an electronic survey via personal contacts to attending and trainee surgeons across six academic institutions to assess the impact of procedural activities and surgical ergonomics (SE) on WRMD symptoms during pregnancy. Fifty-three respondents were currently or had been pregnant while clinically active, representing 93 total pregnancies. 94.7% reported that symptoms were exacerbated by workplace activities during pregnancy and 13.2% took unplanned time off work as a result. Beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy, 89.2% of respondents continued to operate/perform procedures, 81.7% worked >24-h shifts and 69.9% performed repetitive lifting >50 pounds. No respondents were aware of any institutional pregnancy-specific SE policies. Procedural activities can exacerbate pain symptoms for the pregnant surgeon. SE best practices during pregnancy warrant further attention."

Despite a dramatic increase in remote office work, few studies have examined its long-term effects on work environments and worker well-being. A prospective field intervention study was undertaken to examine the effects of a Virtual Office program on office workers' psychosocial perceptions, mental and physical well-being, workplace satisfaction, and performance. A large public service organization undertook a 12-month Virtual Office (VO) pilot program using a systems approach. The study included 137 VO employees (intervention condition), and 85 Conventional Office (CO) employees (control condition). The VO intervention used a work system approach consisting of establishing a steering committee, training programs, and VO resource website. Employee survey measures and follow-up focus group observations were used to examine the impact of the VO intervention. Virtual office participants reported higher job control, group interactions and cohesiveness, and quality of supervision than the CO participants. VO participants reported lower upper body musculoskeletal symptoms and physical/mental stress than CO participants. VO participants reported higher performance (customer satisfaction) than the CO participants. The study findings were sufficiently positive to provide a basis for work organizations to undertake similar pilot programs. Consideration of work system factors when designing an effective VO program can benefit employee's well-being and performance. The rationale for implementing VO programs is underscored by the current COVID-19 pandemic. VO work will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate truck drivers' rest locations and their association with sleep quality utilizing an ergonomic approach. The sleep quality of 81 truck drivers was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). An adapted version of the ergonomics workplace analysis (EWA) instrument was used to evaluate 44 rest locations. Half of the workers preferred sleeper berths (51.2%) as a rest place. Sleep was classified as poor by 71.6% of the drivers. Dorms were rated more positively (p<0.001) by truck drivers (2.0±1.1) than by the analyst (2.6±0.6). Sleeper berths and dorms were rated statistically different by truck drivers (p=0.002), as well as by the analyst (p=0.003). No correlation was found between EWA evaluations and total score for sleep quality. Separate analyses of dorms and truck berths showed very few correlations. The higher the noise of roommates in dorms, the worse the sleep quality. Conversely, noise in corridors or outside the room positively impacted sleep quality. Noise in the rest place may affect sleep in both directions, negatively or positively. Sleep was classified as poor regardless of resting place. The quality of resting places seemed to have little effect on sleep quality of truck drivers. Factors other than rest place, such as work scheduling, are probably more important for promoting good sleep quality."

Poor WSC can adversely impact workers' health and high remedial costs for employers. To improve WSC, workers need to improve related knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards WSC through effective health interventional programs at the workplace. The main objective of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the Work Safety Culture Health Education Module (WSCHEM). The specific goals are to improve KAP related to office ergonomics towards WSC among public sector administrative workers in Abeokuta, Nigeria MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a two-armed, singleblinded cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) involving 247 public sector administrative workers from clusters of 20 ministries in Abeokuta, Southwestern Nigeria. The intervention group was given WSCHEM, whereas the waitlist group received a seminar on team building and leadership skills and received the WSCHEM after the intervention program ended. The evaluation was done three times using the first formal validated, self-administered Work Safety Culture Questionnaire (WSCQ) among the administrative workers: first at baseline, second at 1 month, and third at 3 months post-intervention. The results showed no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the respondents' characteristics (socio-demographic and occupational/officerelated ergonomic factors) and the outcome variables KAP towards WSC at baseline. For practices towards WSC, both intervention (β 6.8, 95%CI 4.85, 8.72) and time (β 6.2, 95%CI 4.49, 7.94) significantly improved the respondents' practices towards WSC in the per-protocol analysis. In the secondary outcomes, both knowledge of WSC, intervention (β 3.5, 95%CI 2.8, 4.2) and time (β 3.4, 95%CI 2.7, 5.9); and attitudes towards WSC, intervention (β1.7, 95%CI 1.25, 2.23) and time (β 2.3, 95%CI 1.92, 2.76) significantly improved the respondents' level of knowledge and attitudes respectively towards WSC. The intervention, WSCHEM, was effective in improving the administrative workers' KAP towards WSC, as demonstrated by the significance between and within-group differences."

So, this study aimed at identifying the nature of hazards prevailing in dental hospitals and their role in increasing job-related stress. The study also assumes that awareness of the existence of health hazards and their possible risk will originate the stress. To conduct the study, close-ended questionnaires were administered to 300 workers having more than 1 year of experience in Oral and Dental Health Services provided by the Kingdom of Bahrain. In total, 222 responses with an acceptable level of accuracy were included for statistical treatment. Results confirmed the prevalence of ergonomic, biological, physical, and, to some extent, chemical hazards in the workplace. Results revealed that stress befalls the employees as they know their exposure to these hazards. Ergonomic hazards have the highest prevalence, chemical hazards are the least prevalent, while biological and physical hazards fall in between. This study enriches the related bank of literature by tapping the hazards specifically in the dental hospitals' environment with the degree of intensity of their prevalence within the context at hand. The study of the impact of these workplace health hazards on occupational stress with mediating effect of awareness is also an addition to the existing literature. The findings may help hospital administrators to take correct measures to manage job-related stress that is counterproductive and take remedial steps to mitigate these hazards."

        "abstract": "Extreme heat events are increasing in frequency, severity, and duration. It is well known that heat stress can have a negative impact on occupational health and productivity, particularly during physical work. However, there are no up-to-date reviews on how vulnerability to heat changes as a function of individual characteristics in relation to the risk of hyperthermia and work capacity loss. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the role of individual characteristics on the human heat stress response, specifically in relation to hyperthermia risk and productivity loss in hot workplaces. Finally, we aim to generate practical guidance for industrial hygienists considering our findings. Factors included in the analysis were body mass, body surface area to mass ratio, body fat, aerobic fitness and training, heat adaptation, aging, sex, and chronic health conditions. We found the relevance of any factor to be dynamic, based on the work-type (fixed pace or relative to fitness level), work intensity (low, moderate, or heavy work), climate type (humidity, clothing vapor resistance), and variable of interest (risk of hyperthermia or likelihood of productivity loss). Heat adaptation, high aerobic fitness, and having a large body mass are the most protective factors during heat exposure. Primary detrimental factors include low fitness, low body mass, and lack of heat adaptation. Aging beyond 50 years, being female, and diabetes are less impactful negative factors, since their independent effect is quite small in well matched participants. Skin surface area to mass ratio, body composition, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are not strong independent predictors of the heat stress response. Understanding how individual factors impact responses to heat stress is necessary for the prediction of heat wave impacts on occupational health and work capacity. The recommendations provided in this report could be utilized to help curtail hyperthermia risk and productivity losses induced by heat."

The findings offer an overview of various categories of impacts, such as changes in partners' views, in workplace settings and conditions, in practices and policies, and in economic outcomes. In these types of IR, health effects measurement is not the main objective, and direct health outcomes are difficult to assess. Explicitly talking about sex/gender led more often to system-level changes but less often to workplace-level changes, compared to interventions where sex/gender was not identified as a specific object of the intervention."

This study aims to explore how the COVID-19 lockdown has affected pain in the lower-back of adult computer professionals. Individuals aged 20-55, both male and female, meeting inclusion criteria (computer/laptop WFH, worked more than an hour on a computer/laptop) were invited to participate voluntarily after providing informed consent. A Google Forms survey was distributed, including self-reported demographic questions, work hours on a computer/laptop during-lockdown, and Oswestry-Low-Back-Disability-Questionnaire (OLBDQ) to assess low-back-pain (LBP) pre- and during-lockdown. The mean OLBDQ score, pre-lockdown 3.681 with 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.621, 4.741] and during-lockdown 4.893 with 95% CI [3.317, 6.470]. A relevant difference was identified among the working hours' scores from the pre-lockdown and during-lockdown of the OLBDQ for low back pain. The obtained Working from home has been associated with increased low back pain in both male and female employees during the COVID-19 lockdown, with poor ergonomics at home being a potential contributing factor. This highlights the importance of raising awareness among working individuals about adopting proper ergonomic practices while using computers, both at home and work, to prevent musculoskeletal issues and promote spinal health. Promoting ergonomics can mitigate musculoskeletal issues, reducing absenteeism and enhancing productivity and efficiency amid prolonged remote work. Future studies should delve deeper into the ergonomic set-up of home workstations of employees working from home to assess their specific impact on musculoskeletal health."

Nail technicians have many exposures at work including chemical, biological, physical, and ergonomic hazards but few data exist on their symptoms or occupational health and safety practices, particularly in the Canadian context. The aim of this study was to learn about nail technicians, their work, and their health and safety practices. Nail technicians were recruited from nail salons in Toronto, Ontario. Participants completed an anonymous survey with questions about demographics, work tasks, workplace health and safety practices, and symptoms (skin, respiratory, and musculoskeletal). A total of 155 nail technicians (95% female) participated in the survey. The majority of nail technicians performed manicures (99%) and pedicures (96%) and applied shellac polishes (86%). Only a third (34%) applied acrylic artificial nails. The reported use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was very high; 88% reported using a mask at work and 96% reporting using gloves. The most common symptoms reported by technicians were neck (44%) and back pain (38%). Skin and respiratory symptoms were less common with 6% of technicians reporting cough, 8% wheeze, and 5% a current rash. Technicians working over 30 h per week reported more neck pain (52 vs. 32%, P = 0.02). Technicians who reported using shellac polishes were more likely to report a runny nose (25 vs. 0%, P = 0.01). Nail technicians in Toronto, Canada are experiencing work-related symptoms. Musculoskeletal symptoms were the most common symptoms reported. Much of the focus on nail salons and health has been on chemical exposures, but ergonomic hazards should not be overlooked. Efforts to increase knowledge and improve occupational health in nail salons should include information on multiple possible workplace hazards and how to reduce impacts of exposure."

A questionnaire survey was conducted among Finnish food industry employees between 2003 and 2009 and the intervention \"senior program\" was provided between 2004 and 2009. The type of pension for the respondents who had retired by 2019 was obtained and dichotomized as statutory vs. early labor market exit. Disability pension was investigated as a separate outcome. Information on work-related factors was obtained from the survey. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with their 95% confidence intervals. Fifty-one employees had early labor market exit. Of them, 70% (n = 36) were control participants. Employees in the senior program worked for longer years (mean years 7.4, 95% CI 6.4-8.1) compared to the control (6.6, 95% CI 6.3-7.5). Sixty percent lower risk of early labor market exit (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.84) and disability pension was found among employees in the senior program compared to the control group. Good work ability had a 94% lower risk (0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.29) of early labor market exit and 85% lower risk (0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.73) of disability pension compared to poor work ability. Employees with musculoskeletal pain had 4 times higher risk of disability pension compared to those without musculoskeletal pain. A workplace senior program intervention prolonged work life and had positive effect on reducing disability pension among older industrial workers."

Methods A prospective one-year cluster randomized trial was conducted. Participants received an individualized workstation ergonomics intervention, combined with 12 weeks of either workplace neck-specific exercises or health promotion information. Health-related productivity at baseline, post-intervention and 12-months was measured with the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using multilevel mixed models. Results We recruited 763 office workers from 14 organizations and allocated them to 100 clusters. For the general population of office workers, monetized productivity loss at 12 months [AU$1464 (standard deviation [SD] 1318) versus AU$1563 (SD=1039); P=0.023]; and presenteeism at 12 months [2.0 (SD 1.2) versus 2.4 (SD 1.4); P=0.007] was lower in the exercise group compared to those in the health promotion information group. For office workers with neck pain, exercise participants had lower sickness absenteeism at 12 months compared to health promotion information participants [0.7 days (SD 1.0) versus 1.4 days (SD 3.1); P-=0.012], despite a short-term increase in sickness absenteeism post-intervention compared to baseline for the exercise group [1.2 days (SD 2.2) versus 0.6 days (SD 0.9); P<0.001]. Conclusion A workplace intervention combining ergonomics and neck-specific exercise offers possible benefits for sickness presenteeism and health-related productivity loss among a general population of office workers and sickness absenteeism for office workers with neck pain in the longer-term."

All studies that addressed occupational safety and health e-training interventions designed to address worker injuries, accidents, and diseases were chosen from PubMed and Scopus until 2021. Two independent reviewers conducted the screening process for titles, abstracts, and full texts, and disagreements on the inclusion or exclusion of an article were resolved by consensus and, if necessary, by a third reviewer. The included articles were analyzed and synthesized using the constant comparative analysis method. The search identified 7,497 articles and 7,325 unique records. Following the title, abstract, and full-text screening, 25 studies met the review criteria. Of the 25 studies, 23 were conducted in developed and two in developing countries. The interventions were carried out on either the mobile platform, the website platform, or both. The study designs and the number of outcomes of the interventions varied significantly (multi-outcomes vs. single-outcome). Obesity, hypertension, neck/shoulder pain, office ergonomics issues, sedentary behaviors, heart disease, physical inactivity, dairy farm injuries, nutrition, respiratory problems, and diabetes were all addressed in the articles. According to the findings of this literature study, e-trainings can significantly improve occupational safety and health. E-training is adaptable, affordable, and can increase workers' knowledge and abilities, resulting in fewer workplace injuries and accidents. Furthermore, e-training platforms can assist businesses in tracking employee development and ensuring that training needs are completed. Overall, this analysis reveals that e-training has enormous promise in the field of occupational safety and health for both businesses and employees."

Little is known about the working conditions at home and its impact on the employee's occupational health. This systematic review examines the working conditions at employees' homes, the work-related disorders associated with working from home, organizations' perceptions of ergonomics at home and how they support their teleworkers. A search of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Open Grey, Pedro, PsychInfo, PubPsych, Scopus and Web of Science) was performed. Twelve studies were included in this review. The findings highlight the lack of ergonomic working conditions for home-based teleworkers. Furthermore, the results underline organizations' lack of awareness regarding home-based policies, ergonomics programs and the health-related consequences associated with the absence of ergonomic support. These findings suggest that home-based teleworkers have increased health risks. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that most of the included studies reported teleworkers who have experienced musculoskeletal issues. These results underline the necessity for implementing ergonomic design recommendations, especially for working at home. Further research is needed to understand the impact of ergonomics programs and workplace design for working at home."

The main differences between the two periods were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon test in terms of physical activity, computer use time, and severity of headaches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in MSD (68.2% vs. 74.6%) and their intensity (2.83 ± 2.36 vs. 3.50 ± 2.79 points) among the student population ("

This study serves to assess the causes, costs, and disability of common work-related musculoskeletal injuries within the police, emergency medical service (EMS) workers, and firefighters of Ohio based on data from the OBWC (Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation). Our dataset included all OBWC injury claims involving a shoulder, low back, or knee from 2010 through 2014. Police and Firefighter leaders were analyzed separately from those not in a leadership role, and workers with combined Firefighter/EMS roles were analyzed separately from \"pure\" Firefighters and EMS personnel. Data were organized through univariate analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey tests and analyzed based on the job of the individual and whether the individual was in a leadership role. Police Officers had the highest number of total injuries in the dataset, followed by Firefighters and Firefighters/EMS workers. Police Officers and Firefighters injured their back and knees more often than their shoulders, while EMS workers injured their backs and shoulders more often than their knees. The mechanisms through which injuries occur are also dependent on the job. Police officers experienced a higher percentage of motor vehicle related back problems, while firefighters had a higher percentage of injuries from overexertion. Musculoskeletal injury claims in these emergency personnel resulted in opioid prescriptions approximately 10%of the time."

There were 3 categories including, health and wellbeing, musculoskeletal discomfort, and workplace ergonomics. General discomfort on a scale from 1 to 100 increased from 31.4 pre to 39.9 during COVID-19. Notable areas increasing in severity of discomfort from pre to during included the neck (41.8 to 47.7), upper back (36.3 to 41.3) and right wrist (38.7 to 43.5). The percentage of the population experiencing discomfort increased from pre to during in the low back (41.5% to 55.2%), upper back (28.7% to 40.9%), neck (45.5% to 60.9%) and right wrist (16.1% to 23.7%). There were three distinct groups for physical activity one group including, one maintaining and one that decreased, which did not have an impact on perceived general discomfort. There was a significant decrease in usage of a desk and adjustable chair and an increase in laptop use. Working from home in some capacity will likely be a more common occurrence which will require further ergonomic assessments and considerations to keep a healthy workforce."

Although LBP prevalence and risk factors have been studied in various professional categories in Saudi Arabia, there is no data on the prevalence of LBP among office workers and related risk factors. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of LBP among office workers in Saudi Arabia and identify major risk factors. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted among office workers in Saudi Arabia of both genders aged over 18 years living in five geographical regions: Central, Western, Southern, Eastern, or Northern. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among office workers using an online survey. The questionnaire comprised sociodemographic characteristics, the prevalence of work-related LBP, and work-related characteristics. Results Among 604 office workers, 51.7% were males and 43.5% were aged between 18 and 30 years old. The prevalence of work-related LBP in this study was 59.9%. Independent risk factors for LBP include being overweight or obese, sleep disturbance, previous history of back trauma, increasing years of working in the office, changes made to workstation/work habits to reduce the risk of LBP, and frequent work stress. Protective risk factors for LBP include regular physical exercise and satisfaction with the current job. Conclusions LBP was widely prevalent among office workers in Saudi Arabia. Office workers with elevated body mass index (BMI) who had a previous history of back trauma and had sleep disturbance or work stress in the past month were at significant risk for LBP. Occupational health and safety programs are vital for building ergonomically safe working conditions, and regular physical exercise promotion could alleviate the risk of LBP at work."

However, perceptions that provision of healthcare by teachers may be detrimental to teaching activities can undermine efforts to scale up school-based malaria control. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of school-based malaria diagnosis and treatment using the Learner Treatment Kit (LTK) on teachers' time. A time and motion study was conducted in 10 primary schools in rural Malawi. Teachers who had been trained to diagnose and treat uncomplicated malaria were continuously observed in real time during school sessions and the time they spent on all activities were recorded by independent observers before and after LTK implementation. A structured form, programmed digitally, was used for data collection. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess pre-post differences in average hours teachers spent on the following key activities: direct teaching; indirect teaching; administration; LTK and non-teaching tasks. Multivariable repeated measures mixed regression models were used to ascertain impact of LTK on average durations teachers spent on the key activities. Seventy-four teachers, trained to use LTK, were observed. Their mean age and years of teaching experience were 34.7 and 8.7, respectively. Overall, 739.8 h of teacher observations took place. The average time teachers spent in school before relative to after LTK was 5.8 vs. 4.8 h, p = 0.01. The cumulative percentage of time teachers spent on core teaching activities (teaching and administration) was approximately 76% and did not change substantially before and after LTK. Some 24.3% of teachers' time is spent on non-teaching activities. On average, teachers spent 2.9% of their time providing LTK services daily. Per day, each teacher spent less time on administrative (0.74 vs. 1.07 h, p = 0.02) and non-teaching activities (0.96 vs. 1.41 h, p = 0.01) during LTK compared with the period before LTK. School-based health (SBH) programmes are not detrimental to teaching activities. Teachers manage their time to ensure additional time required for SBH services is not at the expense of teaching duties. Programming and policy implications of tasking teachers with SBH does not have substantial opportunity costs. Teachers should continue delivering SBH programmes to promote learners' health."

A prospective field intervention study was undertaken to examine the effects of a Virtual Office program on office workers' psychosocial perceptions, mental and physical well-being, workplace satisfaction, and performance. A large public service organization undertook a 12-month Virtual Office (VO) pilot program using a systems approach. The study included 137 VO employees (intervention condition), and 85 Conventional Office (CO) employees (control condition). The VO intervention used a work system approach consisting of establishing a steering committee, training programs, and VO resource website. Employee survey measures and follow-up focus group observations were used to examine the impact of the VO intervention. Virtual office participants reported higher job control, group interactions and cohesiveness, and quality of supervision than the CO participants. VO participants reported lower upper body musculoskeletal symptoms and physical/mental stress than CO participants. VO participants reported higher performance (customer satisfaction) than the CO participants. The study findings were sufficiently positive to provide a basis for work organizations to undertake similar pilot programs. Consideration of work system factors when designing an effective VO program can benefit employee's well-being and performance. The rationale for implementing VO programs is underscored by the current COVID-19 pandemic. VO work will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future."

Poor WSC can adversely impact workers' health and high remedial costs for employers. To improve WSC, workers need to improve related knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards WSC through effective health interventional programs at the workplace. The main objective of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the Work Safety Culture Health Education Module (WSCHEM). The specific goals are to improve KAP related to office ergonomics towards WSC among public sector administrative workers in Abeokuta, Nigeria MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a two-armed, singleblinded cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) involving 247 public sector administrative workers from clusters of 20 ministries in Abeokuta, Southwestern Nigeria. The intervention group was given WSCHEM, whereas the waitlist group received a seminar on team building and leadership skills and received the WSCHEM after the intervention program ended. The evaluation was done three times using the first formal validated, self-administered Work Safety Culture Questionnaire (WSCQ) among the administrative workers: first at baseline, second at 1 month, and third at 3 months post-intervention. The results showed no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the respondents' characteristics (socio-demographic and occupational/officerelated ergonomic factors) and the outcome variables KAP towards WSC at baseline. For practices towards WSC, both intervention (β 6.8, 95%CI 4.85, 8.72) and time (β 6.2, 95%CI 4.49, 7.94) significantly improved the respondents' practices towards WSC in the per-protocol analysis. In the secondary outcomes, both knowledge of WSC, intervention (β 3.5, 95%CI 2.8, 4.2) and time (β 3.4, 95%CI 2.7, 5.9); and attitudes towards WSC, intervention (β1.7, 95%CI 1.25, 2.23) and time (β 2.3, 95%CI 1.92, 2.76) significantly improved the respondents' level of knowledge and attitudes respectively towards WSC. The intervention, WSCHEM, was effective in improving the administrative workers' KAP towards WSC, as demonstrated by the significance between and within-group differences."

Otherwise, there is a risk these technologies will not fit their intended use and setting, cannot be made to work and scale up, and are not used by, or not accessible to, those in need. To synthesize end-user and professional user perspectives and experiences with low-complexity nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance; and to identify implications for effective implementation and health equity. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Science Citation Index Expanded databases for eligible studies from 1 January 2007 up to 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular test in this review, was completed in 2009. We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, and were focused on perspectives and experiences of users and potential users of low-complexity NAATs to diagnose tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis. NAATs included Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Xpert MTB/XDR, and the Truenat assays. Users were people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB)) and their caregivers, healthcare providers, laboratory technicians and managers, and programme officers and staff; and were from any type of health facility and setting globally. MDR-TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first-line drugs used to treat tuberculosis. We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed confidence in the findings using GRADE CERQual approach. We developed a conceptual framework to illustrate how the findings relate. We found 32 studies. All studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Twenty-seven studies were conducted in high-tuberculosis burden countries and 21 studies in high-MDR-TB burden countries. Only one study was from an Eastern European country. While the studies covered a diverse use of low-complexity NAATs, in only a minority of studies was it used as the initial diagnostic test for all people with presumptive tuberculosis. We identified 18 review findings and grouped them into three overarching categories. Critical aspects users value People with tuberculosis valued reaching diagnostic closure with an accurate diagnosis, avoiding diagnostic delays, and keeping diagnostic-associated cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers valued aspects of accuracy and the resulting confidence in low-complexity NAAT results, rapid turnaround times, and keeping cost to people seeking a diagnosis low. In addition, providers valued diversity of sample types (for example, gastric aspirate specimens and stool in children) and drug resistance information. Laboratory professionals appreciated the improved ease of use, ergonomics, and biosafety of low-complexity NAATs compared to sputum microscopy, and increased staff satisfaction. Challenges reported to realizing those values People with tuberculosis and healthcare workers were reluctant to test for tuberculosis (including MDR-TB) due to fears, stigma, or cost concerns. Thus, low-complexity NAAT testing is not implemented with sufficient support or discretion to overcome barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Delays were reported at many steps of the diagnostic pathway owing to poor sample quality; difficulties with transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources; maintenance of low-complexity NAATs; increased workload; inefficient work and patient flows; over-reliance on low-complexity NAAT results in lieu of clinical judgement; and lack of data-driven and inclusive implementation processes. These challenges were reported to lead to underutilization.  Concerns for access and equity The reported concerns included sustainable funding and maintenance and equitable use of resources to access low-complexity NAATs, as well as conflicts of interest between donors and people implementing the tests. Also, lengthy diagnostic delays, underutilization of low-complexity NAATs, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in the community, and too many eligibility restrictions hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable groups, such as children, people with MDR-TB, or people with limited ability to pay. We had high confidence in most of our findings. Low-complexity diagnostics have been presented as a solution to overcome deficiencies in laboratory infrastructure and lack of skilled professionals. This review indicates this is misleading. The lack of infrastructure and human resources undermine the added value new diagnostics of low complexity have for recipients and providers. We had high confidence in the evidence contributing to these review findings. Implementation of new diagnostic technologies, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, and insufficient data on ground level realities prior and during implementation, as well as problems of conflicts of interest in order to ensure equitable use of resources."

Multiple monitor configurations are used in office settings to promote increased productivity by providing more screen space; however, it is unknown if there are health-related trade-offs to increased productivity. A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement guidelines and adapted the best evidence synthesis. Eighteen studies were included in our review. There was strong evidence that implementing dual monitors is in line with users' preference. There was also moderate evidence for controlled laboratory studies demonstrating that multiple monitors may increase task efficiency with decreased desktop interaction; however, implementing multiple monitors may also result in nonneutral neck postures for users. More research needs to be conducted on biomechanical exposures when using larger displays. Longitudinal field studies should be conducted to determine the influence of monitor interventions on health, productivity, and well-being. All studies must consider task complexity and user positioning and should measure health and productivity outcomes together. Researchers must also consider up-to-date purchasing trends when choosing the monitor configurations and sizes for their studies. Regulatory bodies and practitioners can use the results to develop evidence-based monitor guidelines and inform decision-making in practice, respectively. Researchers can use this information to design future studies on monitor configurations that incorporate current purchasing trends."

Therefore, identifying effective, affordable, feasible and sustainable solutions to mitigate the negative effects on worker health and productivity, is an increasingly urgent need. To systematically identify and evaluate methods that mitigate occupational heat strain in order to provide scientific-based guidance for practitioners. An umbrella review was conducted in biomedical databases employing the following eligibility criteria: 1) ambient temperatures > 28 °C or hypohydrated participants, 2) healthy adults, 3) reported psychophysiological (thermal comfort, heart rate or core temperature) and/or performance (physical or cognitive) outcomes, 4) written in English, and 5) published before November 6, 2019. A second search for original research articles was performed to identify interventions of relevance but lacking systematic reviews. All identified interventions were independently evaluated by all co-authors on four point scales for effectiveness, cost, feasibility and environmental impact. Following screening, 36 systematic reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The most effective solutions at mitigating occupational heat strain were wearing specialized cooling garments, (physiological) heat acclimation, improving aerobic fitness, cold water immersion, and applying ventilation. Although air-conditioning and cooling garments in ideal settings provide best scores for effectiveness, the limited applicability in certain industrial settings, high economic cost and high environmental impact are drawbacks for these solutions. However, (physiological) acclimatization, planned breaks, shading and optimized clothing properties are attractive alternative solutions when economic and ecological sustainability aspects are included in the overall evaluation. Choosing the most effective solution or combinations of methods to mitigate occupational heat strain will be scenario-specific. However, this paper provides a framework for integrating effectiveness, cost, feasibility (indoors and outdoor) and ecologic sustainability to provide occupational health and safety professionals with evidence-based guidelines."

The length of time that cognitive performance benefits are sustained following bouts of breaking up sitting (e.g., using sit-stand desks or walking) is not known. A narrative review of the literature was conducted using a systematic search strategy, with keywords related to breaking up sitting interventions in office-based environments and cognitive performance outcomes in the period immediately post the cessation of the breaking up sitting intervention. Three types of office-based breaking up sitting interventions were identified; 1) sit-stand desks, 2) walking desks and 3) cycling desks. From the eight studies which met the criteria, the impacts of these interventions on cognitive performance outcomes were mixed, with significant benefits in some studies and others reporting no benefit. Of the cognitive domains assessed, working memory, attention, and psychomotor function showed significant sustained improvement for up to 30 minutes post intervention. While there are benefits to a key set of cognitive performance domains following breaking up sitting interventions in office-based settings, no studies have evaluated whether benefits to cognitive performance persist for longer than 30 minutes after the breaking up sitting intervention. Furthermore, specific applications of these cognitive benefits to tasks outside of work (e.g., driving home from work) are unknown."

There is a role for ergonomic office and school design to positively impact worker and student productivity, and one design attribute drawing attention is the indoor lit environment. In this review, we expand upon the role that light plays in education, as it has enabled millions of pupils to read at late hours, which were previously too dark. However, still unappreciated is the biological effects of artificial light on circadian rhythm and its subsequent impacts on health and learning outcomes. This review describes the current state of light in the educational environment, its impact, and the effect of certain inexpensive and easy-to-implement adaptations to better support student growth, learning and development. We find that the current lighting environment for pupils is sub-optima based on biological mechanism and may be improved through cost effective interventions. These interventions can achieve greater biological harmonization and improve learner outcomes. The impact of the lighting environment in educational institutions on pupil biology has received minimal attention thus far. The current lighting environment in schools is not conducive to student health and educational performance. Cost-effective approaches can have an outsized impact on student health and educational attainment. We strongly recommend educational institutions take the lit environment into account when designing educational programs."

The technology provides digital image capture, telemedicine capabilities, improved ergonomics, and the ability to biopsy under pneumorectum while maintaining the low cost of conventional rigid sigmoidoscopy. The primary outcome was adverse events, and the secondary outcome was diagnostic view. Fifty patients underwent outpatient (n = 25) and surgical rectal assessment (n = 25), with a mean age of 60 years. This included 31 men and 19 women with 12 different clinical use indications. No adverse events were reported, and no defects were reported with the instrumentation. Satisfactory diagnoses were obtained in 48 (96%) of 50 uses, images were captured in 48 (96%) of 50 uses, and biopsies were successfully taken in 13 uses (26%). No adverse events were recorded. Independent reviewers of recorded videos agreed on the quality and diagnostic value of the images with a κ of 0.225 (95% CI, 0.144-0.305) when assessing whether the target pathology was adequately visualized. The improved views afforded by digital rectoscopy facilitated a satisfactory clinical diagnosis in 96% of uses. The device was successfully deployed in the operating room and outpatients irrespective of bowel preparation method, where it has the potential to replace flexible sigmoidoscopy for specific use cases. The technology provides a high-quality image and video that can be securely recorded for documentation and medicolegal purposes with agreement between blinded users despite a lack of standardized training and heterogenous pathology. We perceive significant impact of this technology for the assessment of colorectal anastomoses, the office management of colitis, \"watch and wait,\" and for diagnostic support in rectal cancer diagnosis. The technology has significant potential to facilitate proctoring and training, and it now requires prospective trials to validate its diagnostic accuracy against more costly flexible sigmoidoscopy systems."

This cross-sectional study included 1,749 workers from an insurance company.

Additionally, estimated maximal oxygen uptake as the CRF data was calculated using a validated equation: 59.96 - 0.23 × age + 7.39 × sex - 0.79 × body mass index + 0.33 × physical activity score. The company provided medical checkup results for CVD risk factors and healthcare costs. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for CVD risk. Significantly lower ORs for CVD risk were seen only with high CRF levels, and it was also associated with low annual healthcare costs. There were no associations between domain-specific STs and annual healthcare costs. Further explorations of domain-specific STs, physical activity, and health risks are warranted, and guidelines should focus on increasing CRF to prevent CVD risk among office workers."

The fall risk assessment tests for many lack a context that would bring them closer to everyday life. Thus, immersive virtual reality, which makes it possible to simulate everyday situations, could make it possible to strengthen the quality of the assessment of the risk of falls. However, it is necessary to understand how the use of a virtual reality device influences the motor control of elderly participants. If vestibular physiotherapists use VR to virtualize their tools, what impact would a visual simulation of movement have on motor control in a locomotor task, if this simulation were plausible? Sixty-two elders (70.8 ± 6.7 years old) completed a Timed Up and Go task under 3 conditions: real, virtual reality, and virtual reality with visual and sound movement information. The virtual reality task takes place in a train either stationary at a station or in uniform linear motion. The time and number of steps were recorded using video, and comparisons between conditions were made using Friedman's test. The results show a significant increase in the time and number of steps in \"virtual reality\" condition compared to the \"real\" condition. They do not show significant differences between the 2 virtual conditions. The use of a running virtual train to provide plausible movement is particularly distinguished from vestibular physiotherapy applications with first a fixed visual support partially obscuring the optical flow. This visual aid coupled with the attention dedicated to the task inhibits the effect of the moving environment on locomotion. However, the visual optical flow will potentially have an effect in people with fear of falling. Virtual reality shows great potential for the simulation of realistic environments for the assessment of the risk of falls and opens up avenues for the development of tests."

The aim of this study was to use ML methods to estimate the effect of individual factors, ergonomic interventions, quality of work life (QWL), and productivity on work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in the neck area of office workers. To measure the impact of interventions, modeling with the ML method was performed on the data of a quasi-randomized control trial. The data included the information of 311 office workers (aged 32.04±5.34). Method neighborhood component analysis (NCA) was used to measure the effect of factors affecting WMSDs, and then support vector machines (SVMs) and decision tree algorithms were utilized to classify the decrease or increase of disorders. Three classified models were designed according to the follow-up times of the field study, with accuracies of 86.5%, 80.3%, and 69%, respectively. These models could estimate most influencer factors with acceptable sensitivity. The main factors included age, body mass index, interventions, QWL, some subscales, and several psychological factors. Models predicted that relative absenteeism and presenteeism were not related to the outputs. In this study, the focus was on disorders in the neck, and the obtained models revealed that individual and management interventions can be the main factors in reducing WMSDs in the neck. Modeling with ML methods can create a new understanding of the relationships between variables affecting WMSDs."

However, there is limited locally relevant literature for guiding policy for the South African Police Service (SAPS). The purpose of this review was to describe the occupational hazards, injuries and diseases affecting police officers worldwide, in order to benchmark policy implications for the SAPS. We conducted a systematic review of studies using Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus. A total of 36 studies were included in this review. Six revealed that police officers' exposure to accident hazards may lead to acute or chronic injuries such as sprains, fractures or even fatalities. These hazards may occur during driving, patrol or riot control. There were two studies, which confirmed physical hazards such as noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), due to exposure to high levels of noise. Three studies on chemical hazards revealed that exposure to high concentrations of carbon dioxide and general air pollution was associated with cancer, while physical exposure to other chemical substances was linked to dermatitis. Four studies on biological hazards demonstrated potential exposure to blood borne diseases from needle stick injuries (NSIs) or cuts from contaminated objects. One study on ergonomic hazards showed that musculoskeletal disorders can result from driving long distances and lifting heavy objects. There were 15 studies that indicated psychological hazards such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as stress. Moreover, four studies were conducted on organizational hazards including burnout, negative workplace exposure and other factors. This review outlined the global impact of occupational hazards, injuries and diseases in the police force. It served as a benchmark for understanding the policy implications for South Africa, where there is paucity of studies on occupational health and safety."

This study investigated the impact of SM interruptions and task cognitive levels on mental workload (MWL) and physiological indexes. Each subject performed six simulated computer tasks differentiated by two factors: task cognitive level and performing condition. MWL was reflected through three categories of data: perceived mental workload, physiological indexes, and primary task performance. The results revealed significant effects of SM interruptions on heart rate, low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio, and skin conductance. ANOVA results showed there were main effects of task cognitive level on LF/HF and skin conductance. These effects during interrupted tasks were more profound. In addition, participants experienced higher MWL and recorded lower primary task performance in the knowledge-based task than the rule- and skill-based tasks. Our findings can guide managers and employees regarding appropriate use of SM in the workplace and better managing interruption and workload."

The purpose of this study investigates the impact of the screen height on the muscle activation of head flexion, neck and shoulder, and the cervical spine torque to provide the favorite screen height for laptop user. Twelve healthy young participants completed a 15-minute task of the reading at the four different screen heights. sEMG signals of the splenius capitis (SC) and upper trapezius (UT) were measured and calculated the root mean square (RMS) and mean power frequency (MPF) to determine muscle fatigue. The different height of laptop users was simulated and the forces on the spine of users at different screen heights were analyzed by Jack. Adjusting the height of the laptop screen can effectively reduce head flexion and muscle activity of SC and UT, and has a positive effect on reducing fatigue of SC, but has no significant effect on UT. Adjusting the height of the laptop screen can delay the occurrence of SC muscle fatigue to a certain extent. The joint analysis of sEMG spectrum and amplitude reports that the screen heights of D15 and D45 have the highest and the lowest frequency of fatigue, respectively. At the same time, the moment of spineT1/T2 and spineL4/L5 decrease with the increase of screen height."

Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18-65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI:  - 4.18 to  - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics.

However, there is a lack of a quantitative, real-time measure that reflects on whether office workers can immediately become more concentrated and work more efficiently when they switch to a standing posture. To tackle this problem, this study proposed that the number of effective computer interactions could be used as a real-time indicator to measure the productivity of office workers whose work is primarily computer-based. Using this metric, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate the correlation between posture and productivity changes at a 10-minute resolution for eight participants. The study found that when allowed to use sit-stand desks to adjust postures, participants chose to switch to standing posture for about 47 min on average once a day; standing work was most frequent between 2:30 - 4:00 pm, followed by 10:30 - 11:30 am, during which time the number of computer interactions also became higher, showing a significant positive correlation. In addition, participants were approximately 6.5% more productive than when they could only work in a sitting posture. This study revealed that posture changes could have an immediate improvement in productivity."

The data of 396 employees of both sexes were analyzed. The study used standardized psychological questionnaires to measure the level of perceived stress ( In the group of people whose workplace was moved to another building (in accordance with the concept), the relationship between the level of stress and selected variables: age, sense of generalized self-efficacy was checked. A significant negative correlation between the level of stress and age was confirmed (ρ = -0.16, p = 0.023), meaning a decrease in the level of stress with age. The level of stress correlated positively with the sense of efficacy (ρ = 0.21, p = 0.003), which means, the higher the sense of effectiveness, the higher the level of stress. In addition, it was confirmed that the level of stress in the group of people changing their location differed significantly from the general population. Work in the ABW concept can contribute to the improvement of interpersonal communication and facilitate the social integration of employees and better evaluation of work in this model. Work in concept has not been shown to be a protective factor against back pain in people with obesity. It was confirmed that in people relocated from traditional office to office in the concept, relocation was associated with stress, but also with a greater sense of self-efficacy.

Hence, thermal protection is essential for diver safety. Typically, protection is provided by wetsuits made of bubbled neoprene. However, neoprene shrinks with depth and loses thermal insulation capability, while thick neoprene suits make swimming exhausting. Herein, a proof-of-concept is presented for a solution to both problems: a 'K-suit' made of thermally-resistive composite segments attached to a thin neoprene suit. The segments are made of hollow glass microspheres embedded in carrier polymer thermally cured in 3D-printed molds based on 3D-scans of the diver's body. The K-suit was compared in field trials with a 7 mm commercial neoprene suit by diving in pairs, while automated dataloggers registered pressure and temperature inside and outside both suits. The K-suit demonstrated +4ºC higher temperature difference than the 7 mm neoprene. Also, divers reported that the K-suit had the ergonomics of a 3 mm neoprene suit. These preliminary results represent a proof-of-concept for the K-suit and promise further improvements with potential impact on diver safety."

The indices from electrodermal activity and respiration had a significant increment as task difficulty increased. There were no significant differences between the average heart rate and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio among tasks. The classification of mental workload using combined indices as inputs showed that classification models combining physiological signals and task performance can reach satisfying accuracy at 96.4% and an accuracy of 78.3% when only using physiological indices as inputs. The present study also showed that ECG and EDA signals have good discriminating power for mental workload detection."

Generalised estimating equations evaluated group differences in the point prevalence of neck pain cases (defined as those with a neck pain score of ≥3 on a 0 (no pain) to 9 (worst pain) scale) over time (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) with cumulative incidence of neck pain cases evaluated descriptively. While no significant group × time interaction was evident, the 12-month point prevalence of neck pain cases in the intervention group (10%) was half that of the active control group (20%) (adjusted OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01, p=0.05). Lower cumulative incidence of neck pain cases was observed in the intervention (17%) compared with active control group (30%) over the 12 months. A combined ergonomics and exercise intervention may have more benefits in preventing neck pain cases in office workers than an ergonomic and health education intervention. Group differences were modest and should be interpreted with caution when considering strategies for primary prevention of neck pain in the office worker population. ACTRN12612001154897."

Both a Vaccination Time-Motion Study and Vaccine Practice Management Survey were conducted (March - October 2017) in a convenience sample of 19 family medicine (FM), internal medicine (IM), and obstetrician-gynecology (OBGYN) practices, in nine states. Practices were directly observed during a one week period; estimates were collected of time spent on activities that could not be directly observed. Cost estimates were calculated by converting staff time for performed activities. In the time-motion study, FM and IM practices spent similar time conducting vaccination activities (median = 5 min per vaccination), while OBGYN practices spent more time (median = 29 min per vaccination). Combining results from the time-motion study and the practice management survey, the median costs of vaccination remained similar for FM practices and IM practices at $7 and $8 per vaccination, respectively, but was substantially higher for OBGYN practices at $43 per vaccination. Factors that contributed to higher costs among OBGYN practices were the increased time to counsel patients, administer vaccines, and to plan and manage vaccine supplies. In addition, 68% of OBGYN patients who were offered and counseled to receive vaccines declined to receive them. Counseling patients who ultimately do not go on to receive a vaccine may be an important cost factor. Lower costs of vaccination services may be achieved by increasing efficiencies in workflow or the volume of vaccinations."

This study evaluated the impact of an ergonomic and exercise training (EET) intervention and an ergonomic and health promotion (EHP) intervention on neck pain intensity among the All Workers and a subgroup of Neck Pain cases at baseline. A 12-month cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 14 public and private organisations. Office workers aged ≥18 years working ≥30 h per week (n = 740) received an individualised workstation ergonomic intervention, followed by 1:1 allocation to the EET group (neck-specific exercise training), or the EHP group (health promotion) for 12 weeks. Neck pain intensity (scale: 0-9) was recorded at baseline, 12 weeks, and 12 months. Participants with data at these three time points were included for analysis (n = 367). Intervention group differences were analysed using generalized estimating equation models on an intention-to-treat basis and adjusted for potential confounders. Subgroup analysis was performed on neck cases reporting pain ≥3 at baseline (n = 96). The EET group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in neck pain intensity at 12 weeks compared to the EHP group for All Workers (EET: β = - 0.53 points 95% CI: - 0.84- - 0.22 [36%] and EHP: β = - 0.17 points 95% CI: - 0.47-0.13 [10.5%], p-value = 0.02) and the Neck Cases (EET: β = - 2.32 points 95% CI: - 3.09- - 1.56 [53%] and EHP: β = - 1.75 points 95% CI: - 2.35- - 1.16 [36%], p = 0.04). Reductions in pain intensity were not maintained at 12 months with no between-group differences observed in All Workers (EET: β = - 0.18, 95% CI: - 0.53-0.16 and EHP: β = - 0.14 points 95% CI: - 0.49-0.21, p = 0.53) or Neck Cases, although in both groups an overall reduction was found (EET: β = - 1.61 points 95% CI: - 2.36- - 0.89 and EHP: β = - 1.9 points 95% CI: - 2.59- - 1.20, p = 0.26). EET was more effective than EHP in reducing neck pain intensity in All Workers and Neck Cases immediately following the intervention period (12 weeks) but not at 12 months, with changes at 12 weeks reaching clinically meaningful thresholds for the Neck Cases.

It is not known how task type, worker preference, and occupation impact utilization of the adjustable height feature. This survey-based study aimed to determine how task type, preference and occupation affect office workers' sitting and standing behaviors at work. Office workers (n = 123) from different occupations completed surveys about actual and preferred positions (sit, stand, either/both) during 39 common tasks from 4 different categories, as well as barriers to use. Each position was analyzed by task type, behavior, and occupation. There were differences between actual and preferred behavior for each position, with participants sitting more and standing less than preferred across all task categories. There were differences between task categories with participants sitting less for generative and routine, and standing more for communication tasks. The highest rates of either/both responses were for routine tasks. Engineers reported the lowest standing rates, and also indicated standing more than preferred. Information Tech and Engineering had the highest either/both responses. Finance reported the highest sitting rates. Personal, task-based and workplace limitations were cited as barriers to preferred use. Office workers would prefer to stand more at work. Occupation-specific needs and preferences, as well as types of tasks should be considered when providing workplace standing options."

However, few studies have assessed the association of work-related factors with the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in large population based study. After exclusion of military personnel, 16,099 wage workers (20 ≤ age ≤ 65 years) from the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-2011) were included in this study. Job status was defined as the place of employment of longest duration. To evaluate the working environment, we used a comprehensive work-stressor measure. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of occupation type on the prevalence of PUD. Among the subjects, 5540, 3398, and 7161 were white-, pink-, and blue-collar workers, respectively. The prevalence of PUD was highest among blue-collar workers (n = 336, 7.1%), followed by pink-collar (n = 116, 5.1%) and white-collar (n = 180, 4.9%) workers. In the multivariable analysis, work type and uncomfortable gestures were independently associated with the risk of PUD. Compared with office workers, operators in industrial plants and machine operators had a significantly higher prevalence of PUD (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.3) after adjusting for age, socioeconomic factors, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, daily exercise, sleep duration, and working conditions. In conclusion, work-related factors, particularly blue-collar work and uncomfortable job gestures, are independently associated with the risk of PUD. Therefore, it is important to monitor the development of PUD in workers exposed to these factors."

Kinematic and kinetic experimental studies have been able to identify indicators of WRMSD, but research addressing real-world workplace scenarios is lacking. Hence, the authors of this study aimed to assess the influence of physical strain on the Borg CR-10 body map, ergonomic risk scores, and foot pressure in a real-world setting. (2) Methods: Twenty-four participants (seventeen men and seven women) were included in this field study. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) (n = 24) and in-shoe plantar pressure measurements (n = 18) captured the workload of production and office workers at the beginning of their work shift and three hours later, working without any break. In addition to the two 12 min motion capture processes, a Borg CR-10 body map and fatigue visual analog scale (VAS) were applied twice. Kinematic and kinetic data were processed using MATLAB and SPSS software, resulting in scores representing the relative distribution of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Computer-Assisted Recording and Long-Term Analysis of Musculoskeletal Load (CUELA), and in-shoe plantar pressure. (3) Results: Significant differences were observed between the two measurement times of physical exertion and fatigue, but not for ergonomic risk scores. Contrary to the hypothesis of the authors, there were no significant differences between the in-shoe plantar pressures. Significant differences were observed between the dominant and non-dominant sides for all kinetic variables. (4) Conclusions: The posture scores of RULA and CUELA and in-shoe plantar pressure side differences were a valuable basis for adapting one-sided requirements in the work process of the workers. Traditional observational methods must be adapted more sensitively to detect kinematic deviations at work. The results of this field study enhance our knowledge about the use and benefits of sensors for ergonomic risk assessments and interventions."

Secondary analysis of data from 2 randomized controlled trials. Research laboratory. Individuals (N=40) with chronic stroke. Participants received one of the following interventions: forced exercise+RTP (FE+RTP, n=16), voluntary exercise+RTP (VE+RTP, n=16), or stroke education+RTP (EDU+RTP, n=8). All groups completed 24 sessions, each session lasting 90 minutes. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) were used to assess depressive symptomology and HRQOL. There were no significant group-by-time interactions for any of the SIS domains or composite scores. Examining the individual groups following the intervention, those in the FE+RTP and VE+RTP groups demonstrated significant improvements in the following SIS domains: strength, mobility, hand function, activities of daily living, and the physical composite. In addition, the FE+RTP group demonstrated significant improvements in memory, cognitive composite, and percent recovery from stroke. The HRQOL did not change in the EDU+RTP group. Although CES-D scores improved predominantly for those in the FE+RTP group, these improvements were not statistically significant. Overall, results were maintained at the 4-week follow-up. Aerobic exercise, regardless of mode, preceding motor task practice may improve HRQOL in patients with stroke. The potential of aerobic exercise to improve cardiorespiratory endurance, motor outcomes, and HRQOL poststroke justifies its use to augment traditional task practice."

Active workstations have gained popularity in the workplace, but there remain concerns about their impact on cognitive function. This study investigated the use of a novel under-desk leg swing device on cognitive ability in the workplace compared to sitting. Cognitive ability was measured using a pre-employment aptitude test (CCAT), and perceived outcomes were analyzed via self-report questionnaires. Using a randomized, repeated measures crossover design, 18 undergraduate students undertook the CCAT while using the under-desk leg swing device and while sitting only (Experiment 1). 9 students returned two to three weeks later to repeat testing (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, CCAT scores did not differ significantly between the under-desk leg swing device and sitting (mean difference (MD) = -1.056, standard error (SE) = 1.302,p = 0.429, d = -0.16). Effect sizes of 0.554 were observed for perceived alertness, 0.446 for attention, 0.446 for focus, and 0.564 for enjoyment, but there were no significant differences between the two conditions. CCAT scores were significantly higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 (MD = 8.444, SE = 2.410,p = 0.008, d = 1.64). Based on Experiment 1, the findings suggest that the use of the under-desk leg swing device promotes movement without detriment to neither workflow nor cognitive ability relevant to employee aptitude compared to sitting."

        "abstract": "Air pollution, a major environmental threat to human health, contributes to the premature deaths of millions of people worldwide. Cooking with solid fuels, such as charcoal and wood, in low- and middle-income countries generates very high emissions of particulate matter within and near the household as a result of their inefficient combustion. Women are especially exposed, as they often perform the cooking. The purpose of this study was to assess the burden of disease attributable to household air pollution exposure from cooking among women in Adama, Ethiopia. AirQ+ software (WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to assess the health impact of household air pollution by estimating the burden of disease (BoD) including Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (ALRI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), lung cancer, and stroke, among a cohort of women in Adama. Household air pollution exposure estimated by cooking fuel type was assessed through questionnaires. Three-quarters (75%) of Adama's population used solid fuel for cooking; with this, the household air pollution attributable mortality was estimated to be 50% (95% CI: 38-58%) due to ALRI, 50% (95% CI: 35-61%) due to COPD, 50% (95% CI: 27-58%) due to lung cancer, (95% CI: 23-48%) due to IHD, and (95% CI: 23-51%) due to stroke. The corresponding disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 women ranged between 6000 and 9000 per disease. This health impact assessment illustrates that household air pollution due to solid fuel use among women in Adama leads to premature death and a substantial quantity of DALYs. Therefore, decreasing or eliminating solid fuel use for cooking purposes could prevent deaths and improve quality of life."

This study examined the potential impact of falls on accelerating further deterioration over time in gait, balance, physical activity, depression, fear of falling, and motor capacity in older adults. 163 ambulatory older adults (age = 76.5 ± 7.7 years) participated and were followed for 6 months. They were classified into fallers or non-fallers based on a history of falling within the past year. At baseline and 6 months, all participants were objectively assessed for gait, balance, and physical activity using wearable sensors. Additional assessments included psychosocial concerns (depression and fear of falling) and motor capacity (Timed Up and Go test). The fallers showed lower gait performance, less physical activity, lower depression level, higher fear of falling, and less motor capacity than non-fallers at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results also revealed acceleration in physical activity and motor capacity decline compared to non-fallers at a 6-month follow-up. Our findings suggest that falls would accelerate deterioration in both physical activity and motor performance and highlight the need for effective therapy to reduce the consequences of falls in older adults."

J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 757-762, 2022-Specialist tactical police officers (STPOs) carry heavier on-body loads than generalist police officers. Improvements in strength may mitigate the impacts of these heavier loads. The aim of this investigation was to determine the correlations between absolute and relative strength measures and occupational task performance in STPOs. Retrospective data were provided for 47 male specialist police officers from an elite Australian police unit. Data included body mass (mean = 89.0 ± 8.58 kg), strength measures (1 repetition maximum measures for a bench press, squat, deadlift, and pull-up), and task performance measures (85-kg victim drag wearing 15 kg of operational load and 5-km pack march wearing 40 kg of operational load). Pearson's correlations were conducted to determine relationships between measures and were plotted on a linear regressions model. Significant, moderate to strong correlations were found between all strength measures and victim drag performance and significant negative moderate correlations between relative bench press, absolute and relative squat, and absolute and relative pull-up and pack march times. The absolute deadlift had the strongest correlation to the victim drag (r = 0.747, p < 0.01) while the relative pull-up showed the strongest correlation with pack march performance (r = -0.466, p < 0.01). The requirement to lift a portion of the dummy off the ground during the victim drag may explain the increased importance of absolute strength while the requirement to transport load affixed to the body may explain the importance of relative strength requirements. Improvements in absolute and relative upper- and lower-body strength may improve task performance in this population."

Literature suggests there are both challenges and benefits to remote working and that remote working can have detrimental effects on mental health. This study aimed to explore diplomatic personnel's perceptions and experiences of working from home during the pandemic. Twenty-five employees of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office took part in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out to extract recurring themes from the data. Seven main themes emerged from the data: impact of the pandemic on work; relationships with colleagues; benefits of working from home; challenges of working from home; family; moving posts during the pandemic; and perceptions and predictions of post-pandemic work. Participants provided mixed views on how remote working had affected productivity and relationships with colleagues. Benefits of working from home included greater freedom and flexibility; new opportunities; and inclusivity of remote meetings. Challenges included being in different time zones to the countries they were working for; unsuitable home ergonomics; technological issues; and difficulties finding appropriate work-life balance. Those with young children reported difficulties juggling work and childcare. Adjusting to new posts at a time when staff were working remotely appeared particularly challenging. However, most did not want or expect to return to entirely office-based work. They predicted a hybrid model of working in the future, involving both office work and remote work; they stressed the importance of flexibility and suggested there would not be a one-size-fits-all approach to returning to face-to-face work. Remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the ways in which employees work, showing them that they do not have to be in the office to successfully achieve their work goals and leaving many wanting flexibility to make their own decisions about working from home (or not). There are both benefits and challenges to remote working; managers can take steps to reduce some of the challenges by being available to support their employees, organising regular remote meetings and allowing employees autonomy in terms of when and where they work."

        "abstract": "In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees around the world may be practicing part-time telework at home. Little is known about the working conditions at home and its impact on the employee's occupational health. This systematic review examines the working conditions at employees' homes, the work-related disorders associated with working from home, organizations' perceptions of ergonomics at home and how they support their teleworkers. A search of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Open Grey, Pedro, PsychInfo, PubPsych, Scopus and Web of Science) was performed. Twelve studies were included in this review. The findings highlight the lack of ergonomic working conditions for home-based teleworkers. Furthermore, the results underline organizations' lack of awareness regarding home-based policies, ergonomics programs and the health-related consequences associated with the absence of ergonomic support. These findings suggest that home-based teleworkers have increased health risks. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that most of the included studies reported teleworkers who have experienced musculoskeletal issues. These results underline the necessity for implementing ergonomic design recommendations, especially for working at home. Further research is needed to understand the impact of ergonomics programs and workplace design for working at home."

Wells construction and maintenance involve unpredictabilities, requiring support teams to help the crew onboard the rig to adapt the operations to the reality of the well. Ergonomics and Human Factors (E/HF) literature presented the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remote work on knowledge workers' health and well-being. Still, it lacked studies on the impacts on work activities of the industrial sector.OBJECTIVESince safety knowledge is continuously and collectively developed in the experts' day-to-day work activities, the research objective is to identify the impacts and learnings of remote work on the support teams' safety knowledge management.METHODSThe Ergonomic Work Analysis (EWA) guided the problem understanding, activities observations, and data analysis. The Work System Model (WSM) was the framework for systematizing data from 117 interviews.RESULTSThe results indicate a significant reduction in interactions during the pandemic, making information and safety knowledge sharing more challenging and weakening team members' cooperation. However, no impact on performance was reported. Working from home reduced interruptions and increased focus, facilitating individual tasks.CONCLUSIONSThe research identifies collective and individual strategies developed by the team to cope with remote work. The findings confirm Management Literature findings on reducing interaction, hampering nonverbal communication, and increasing the amount of data. However, communication applications used during the pandemic have expanded rapidly, allowing faster access to team members, improving connectivity onshore/offshore, and making it a valuable legacy of the COVID-19 lockdown."

This study was aimed to synthesis literature that assessed the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions on MSK health. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the review: the condition being considered was MSK health, the intervention was COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions, cross sectional studies, cohort studies, case controlled, prospective studies and retrospective studies. Data were extracted by 2 independent researchers. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Evidence from included studies was summarised using narrative synthesis. Fourteen studies comprising 22,471 participants of the general population from Turkey (n = 5), Italy (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 2), Jordan (n = 1), Bangladesh (n = 1), Estonia (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1) and Saudi Arabia (n = 1) have met the inclusion criteria. The sample size of populations studied ranged from 91 to 1054. The included studies used questionnaire, visual analogic scale, or growth mixture modelling. Except for one study, all the included studies reported increased prevalence and incidence of MSK disorders due to COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions. The findings suggest that COVID-19 related lockdown restriction led to increased MSK disorders. Home-based strategies such as physical activity programmes and ergonomic workspace could potentially guide public health authorities to avoid MSK health problem."

        "abstract": "Telework has become considerably more common during the ongoing pandemic. Although working remotely may have numerous advantages, negative impacts on workers' health and safety should also be considered. Telework is a major contributor to the development or aggravation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders where unsuited workstation ergonomics, sedentary behavior, as well as psychosocial and organizational factors play a role. This paper aims to identify telework-related risks and their impact on musculoskeletal health as well as provide recommendations that may be useful in constructing future preventive measures. A comprehensive literature search regarding the topic has been performed. Teleworkers experience musculoskeletal pain and discomfort mostly in low back area, neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. Poor ergonomic solutions when it comes to workstation design resulting in prolonged sitting in non-neutral positions contribute to the development and aggravation of musculoskeletal disorders in teleworkers. Working with inadequately placed screens and laptops and sitting in maladjusted seats without usual functionalities and ergonomic support is associated with musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. Extended working hours with fewer rest periods to meet increased work demands, social isolation, and lack of support from work colleagues and superiors as well as blurred work-home boundaries and omnipresence of work are commonly stated psychosocial and organizational factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Environmental factors such as poor lighting and glare, inadequate room temperature, and ventilation or noise, are frequently overlooked remote workstation risk factors. For a certain part of workers, telework will remain a common way of work in the post-pandemic period. Therefore, it is essential to identify telework-related risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders and address them with timely preventive measures tailored to each remote workstation's risks and individual workers' needs."

We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the impact of health information technology on nurses' time. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched 6 large databases for relevant articles published between Jan 2004 and December 2019. Two authors reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full texts. We included articles that included a comparison group in the design, measured the time taken to carry out documentation or medication administration, documented the quantitative estimates of time differences between the 2, had nurses as subjects, and was conducted in either a care home, hospital, or community clinic. We identified a total of 1647 articles, of which 33 met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies reported the impact of 12 different health information technology (HIT) implementations on nurses' documentation time. Weighted averages were calculated for studies that implemented barcode medication administration (BCMA) and 2 weighted averages for those that implemented EHRs, as these studies used different sampling units; both showed an increase in the time spent in documentation (+22% and +46%). However, the time spent carrying out medication administration following BCMA implementation fell by 33% (P < .05). HIT also caused a redistribution of nurses' time which, in some cases, was spent in more \"value-adding\" activities, such as delivering direct patient care as well as inter-professional communication. Most of the HIT systems increased nursing documentation time, although time fell for medication administration following BCMA. Many HIT systems also resulted in nurses spending more time in direct care and \"value-adding\" activities."

Specifically addressing the impacts of electronic light from screens, daylight, and task lighting's impact on health and well-being in the frame of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 75 ergonomic and lighting literature publications covering various work environments were reviewed, with a focus on the health effects of screen light, daylight, and task light. Resulting from the literature review, design recommendations regarding the safety and health of home office lighting conditions are discussed. As COVID-19 continues to encourage remote working, individuals will be exposed to daylight and screen light in different ways compared to a traditional office environment. The impact of these different lighting conditions should be further studied to understand best design and well-being practices."

The transition to new work arrangements which involve a hybrid, work and home model, is likely to involve the use of alternative workspaces. Understanding the impacts of CWS on employees is timely to examine the benefits of utilisation and how these might be incorporated into new ways of working. This scoping review aims to explore the relationship between CWS, mental and physical health, and workers' performance, and provide insights into future considerations for design. The main objective was to map the current literature on CWS, focusing on identification of relevant modifiable factors to improve worker's mental and physical health, and performance. Three databases, Embase, PsycInfo, and Proquest, were systematically reviewed, to identify studies from 2005 onwards. Data was extracted and analysed using diagrammatic mapping. Only studies published in English were included. Eleven relevant papers were included which covered the three outcomes of interest: worker's performance (5), mental health (4) and physical health (2). Environmental factors influencing the three outcomes were categorised into physical environment (12 factors) and the psychosocial environment (6 factors). Overall, CWS environmental factors had a positive influence on workers (23 positive relationships and 11 negative relationships). Coworking spaces offer potential benefits for tele-workers, including opportunities for collaboration/networking and productivity gains. However, attention to the CWS physical design is important to optimise the experience for workers and mitigate risk of adverse mental and physical health effects."

Understanding the contributors to children's wellbeing during pandemic disease is the first critical step in contributing to children's health during epidemic diseases. This study employed 276 healthy children, aged 10-12 years, and their parents. Data were collected in October and November 2020, about 9 months after the local closing of schools due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Parents and children answered a separate set of questions. Besides the demographic information, the parents responded to questions on their stress level, perceived risk of COVID-19, and PA avoidance for children. Children responded to questions on their PA and wellbeing in the last week. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS 22. The result of the study supported the four directional research hypotheses of the sequential study model. As hypothesized, parents' stress and perceived risk levels of COVID-19 negatively affected children's PA. The PA level was shown to predict children's wellbeing and mental health. Housing type, parents' job security, number of siblings, number of members living together in-home, and history of death or hospitalization of relatives or family members due to COVID-19 were found to be associated with parents' stress and children's mental health. This study sheds light on parents' role in children's wellbeing and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents with higher stress and high restrictive behaviors might put their children at risk of mental disorders in the end."

Questions exist about how to effectively incorporate these readings into BP follow-up visits. We developed and implemented a tool that combines clinical and home BP readings into an electronic health record (EHR)-integrated visualization tool. We examined how this tool was used during primary care visits and its effect on physician-patient communication and decision making about hypertension management, comparing it with home BP readings on paper. We video recorded the hypertension follow-up visits of 73 patients with 15 primary care physicians between July 2018 and April 2019. During visits, physicians reviewed home BP readings with patients, either directly from paper or as entered into the EHR visualization tool. We used conversation analysis to analyze the recordings. Home BP readings were viewed on paper for 26 patients and in the visualization tool for 47 patients. Access to home BP readings during hypertension management visits, regardless of viewing mode, positioned the physician and patient to assess BP management and make decisions about treatment modification, if needed. Length of BP discussion with the visualization tool was similar to or shorter than that with paper. Advantages of the visualization tool included ease of use, and enhanced and faster sense making and decision making. Successful use of the tool required patients' ability to obtain their BP readings and enter them into the EHR via a portal, and an examination room configuration that allowed for screen sharing. Reviewing home BP readings using a visualization tool is feasible and enhances sense making and patient engagement in decision making. Practices and their patients need appropriate infrastructure to realize these benefits."

This study was conducted at a medical center using a cross-sectional research design. 35 persons with ID (Mage = 40.6 years; 25 women) and 54 normal sleepers (NS; Mage = 31.5 years; 38 women). Participants underwent two nights of home-based polysomnography (PSG) followed by daytime testing with a four-trial Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Before each MSLT nap, they completed a computer-administered battery of reaction time tasks. Measures of response latencies and response accuracy were tabulated and used as dependent measures. The ID and NS groups were each subdivided into \"alert\" (eg, MSLT mean latency > 8 min) and \"sleepy\" (eg, MSLT mean latency ≤ 8 min) subgroups to identify hyperaroused persons with ID and allow for their comparisons with the other participant subgroups. Multivariate analyses of variance showed a significant main effect for level of daytime sleepiness (F [1, 84] = 8.52, p = 0.0045) on simpler performance tasks and a significant main effect for presence vs. absence of ID (F [1,84] = 6.62, p = 0.012) on complex tasks. A lack of significant participant type x MSLT alertness level interactions in study analyses suggested those ID participants with presumed hyperaousal were not relatively more impaired than the other participant subgroups. Daytime performance deficits on simple tasks seem most dependent on individuals' levels of daytime sleepiness, whereas performance deficits on more complex tasks appears related to the presence of ID. Therefore, it seems best to use complex performance measures both to document cognitive deficits among those with ID and to determine if insomnia treatments reduce such impairments.

Given the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such arrangements have risen substantially in a short timeframe. Work-from-home has been associated with several physical and mental health outcomes. This relationship has been supported by previous research; however, these health and safety issues often receive little resources and attention from business perspectives compared to organizational and worker performance and productivity. Therefore, aligning work-from-home practices with business goals may help catalyze awareness from decision makers and serve to effectively implement work-from-home policies. We conducted a review to synthesize current knowledge on the impact of work-from-home arrangements on personal and organizational performance and productivity. Four large databases including Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, and Business Source Complete were systematically searched. Through a two-step screening process, we selected and extracted data from 37 relevant articles. Key search terms surrounded two core concepts: work-from-home and productivity/performance. Of the articles published prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 79% (n = 19) demonstrated that work-from-home increased productivity and performance whereas 21% (n = 5) showed mixed or no effects. Of the articles published during the pandemic, 23% (n = 3) showed positive effects, 38% (n = 5) revealed mixed results, and 38% (n = 5) showed negative effects. Findings suggest that non-mandatory work-from-home arrangements can have positive impacts on productivity and performance. When work-from-home becomes mandatory and full-time, or external factors (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) are at play, the overall impacts are less positive and can be detrimental to productivity and performance. Results will help foster an understanding of the impact of work-from-home on productivity and performance and inform the development of organizational strategies to create an effective, resilient, and inclusive work-from-home workplace by helping to effectively implement work-from-home policies that are aligned with business goals."

Decisions on how to promote employees' health whilst working at home (WAH) need to be based on the best available evidence to optimise worker outcomes. The aim of this rapid review was to review the impact of WAH on individual workers' mental and physical health, and determine any gender difference, to develop recommendations for employers and employees to optimise workers' health. A search was undertaken in three databases, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and Web of Science, from 2007 to May 2020. Selection criteria included studies which involved employees who regularly worked at home, and specifically reported on physical or mental health-related outcomes. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, one author extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments with review by a second author. Twenty-three papers meet the selection criteria for this review. Ten health outcomes were reported: pain, self-reported health, safety, well-being, stress, depression, fatigue, quality of life, strain and happiness. The impact on health outcomes was strongly influenced by the degree of organisational support available to employees, colleague support, social connectedness (outside of work), and levels of work to family conflict. Overall, women were less likely to experience improved health outcomes when WAH. This review identified several health outcomes affected by WAH. The health/work relationship is complex and requires consideration of broader system factors to optimise the effects of WAH on workers' health. It is likely mandated WAH will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future; organisations will need to implement formalised WAH policies that consider work-home boundary management support, role clarity, workload, performance indicators, technical support, facilitation of co-worker networking, and training for managers."

Notable areas increasing in severity of discomfort from pre to during included the neck (41.8 to 47.7), upper back (36.3 to 41.3) and right wrist (38.7 to 43.5). The percentage of the population experiencing discomfort increased from pre to during in the low back (41.5% to 55.2%), upper back (28.7% to 40.9%), neck (45.5% to 60.9%) and right wrist (16.1% to 23.7%). There were three distinct groups for physical activity one group including, one maintaining and one that decreased, which did not have an impact on perceived general discomfort. There was a significant decrease in usage of a desk and adjustable chair and an increase in laptop use. Working from home in some capacity will likely be a more common occurrence which will require further ergonomic assessments and considerations to keep a healthy workforce."

The region's proximity to a large tourist sector provides opportunities for weavers to work from home and sell their products as a primary or secondary income source. The adverse health effects related to craft production and home-based work are significant and not well described in the literature. Participatory ergonomics (PE), an approach that emphasizes the input and participation of individuals directly impacted by the work being studied, is a strong fit for this population. This article describes a PE project among 33 Mapuche weavers that characterizes the hazards, risks and perceived adverse health effects associated with home-based weaving and the identification, implementation and evaluation of three ergonomic interventions. This project can inform the development of sustainable ergonomics health programs for home-based artisans."

This review aims to highlight the differences in exposure to psychosocial risk factors for health between part-time and full-time teleworking from home. The protocol of the systematic review of the literature was registered on PROSPERO 2020 platform according to the PRISMA statement guidelines. The key words \"telework\" and \"frequency\" (\"part-time\" or \"full-time\"), together with their synonyms and variations, were searched. Independent researchers conducted the systematic search of 7 databases: Scopus, SciELO, PePSIC; PsycInfo, PubMed, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) and Web of Science. Of the 638 articles identified from 2010 to June 2021, 32 were selected for data extraction. The authors evaluated the risk of bias and quality of evidence of the studies included using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Main themes categorized include 7 dimensions of psychosocial risk factors: work intensity and working hours; emotional demands; autonomy; social relationships at work; conflict of values, work insecurity and home/work interface. The results revealed scant practice of full-time teleworking prior to the pandemic. Regarding the psychosocial risk factors found, differences were evident before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For part-time and full-time telework prior to the pandemic, the dimensions of intensification of work and working hours, social relationships at work, and the home-work interface were the most prominent factors. However, studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic where teleworking was mostly performed full-time, there was an increase in focus on emotional demands and the home-work interface, and a reduction in the other dimensions. Full-time telework brings important changes in working conditions and has the potential to affect living and health conditions of teleworkers. Part-time teleworking may have positive impact on psychosocial risk factors, favoring work-home balance, communication, and social relationships. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=191455, PROSPERO 2020 CRD4202019 1455."

        "abstract": "Home health care routing and scheduling is a complex problem that requires many aspects to be considered simultaneously. One of the important aspects is ergonomics. Home health care nurses are at higher risk of work-related health problems such as musculoskeletal disorders and burnout since they are frequently exposed to physical, mental, and environmental ergonomic risks in their jobs. Therefore, it is essential to integrate ergonomic considerations into the construction of daily schedules for home health care nurses to mitigate these health risks. The purpose of this study is to present a mathematical model that incorporate ergonomic risks. We introduce a set of constraints into our model to prevent nurses from encountering excessive workloads. To assess the workload, we propose a subjective assessment method and employ a fuzzy inference system to calculate nurses' perceived workload levels. We applied our model to a several numerical examples to investigate the impact of workload on the nurse daily schedules. We observed that, at a specified workload level, there may be alternative solutions where the number of patients visited is the same. Therefore, we defined an objective function to maximize patient visits while minimizing nurses' workload levels as much as possible. As a result, our model generates solutions that effectively reduce nurse workloads, leading to more balanced schedules. Thus, our study offers a comprehensive approach to home health care scheduling by incorporating ergonomic considerations, ultimately enhancing both patient care and nurse well-being."

To summarize the components and explore the effectiveness of home-based interventions for improving sarcopenia and other health-related outcomes among community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia. Systematic review and meta-analysis. The Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Medline (via PubMed), and PsycINFO were searched for relevant papers published from January 1, 2010 to March 29, 2022. Only papers written in English were included. The modified version of Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risks of bias in the included studies. The template for intervention description and replication checklist was used to summarize the intervention components. The mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) was used to determine the effect size of studies using the same or different measuring methods. Random-effects models were in meta-analyses to pool the effects of home-based interventions on the included outcomes. After detailed screening and exclusion, 11 randomized controlled trials including 1136 older people with sarcopenia were included in our analyses. Three categories of home-based interventions were identified: exercise interventions, nutritional interventions, and combined exercise and nutritional interventions. The overall analysis of the outcomes (e.g., appendicular skeletal muscle mass index, lean mass, body fat mass, handgrip strength, and gait speed), showed that the effects of home-based exercise interventions were inconclusive. Compared with passive controls, home-based exercise interventions significantly improved knee extension strength (MD = 0.56 kg, 95 % CI: 0.09, 1.03, p = 0.020) and reduced the time required to complete the Timed Up and Go Test (MD = -1.41 s, 95 % CI: -2.28, -0.54, p = 0.001). Home-based nutritional interventions were effective in improving appendicular skeletal muscle mass (MD = 0.25 kg, 95 % CI: 0.02, 0.49, p = 0.030), gait speed (MD = 0.06 m/s, 95 % CI: 0.03, 0.09, p = 0.0001), and quality of life in terms of both the physical component summary (MD = 13.54, 95 % CI: 0.73, 26.34, p = 0.040) and mental component summary scores (MD = 8.69, 95 % CI: 2.98, 14.41, p = 0.003). Home-based exercise interventions have the potential to improve muscle strength and physical function, while home-based nutritional interventions are effective in increasing muscle mass, physical function, and quality of life. Both of these can be applied at home during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to alleviate sarcopenia and improve health-related outcomes in community-dwelling older people."

The way in which people care for their health affects not only their health, but also their well-being, quality of life, and work ability. The lifestyle and health behavior have a significant impact on health, whereas a lack of pro-health behavior may cause the risk of many diseases and mortality, especially among men. The aim of the study was to define the determinants of positive health behaviors among men aged 20-65, active on the labor market. To check the attitudes of men toward health and health behavior, a questionnaire-based research has been carried out among 600 men active on the labor market. Several tools were used: Positive Health Behaviour Scale (Woynarowska-Sołdan & Węziak-Białowolska, 2012), Work Ability Index (Tuomi et al., 1998), work-life balance-with the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (subscale \"Work-home conflict\") (Kristensen & Borg, 2005), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (Wallston & Wallston, 1978, in polish adaptation Juczyński, 2001), Inventory for Psychological Sex Assessment (Kuczyńska, 2012) and Personal Values (Juczyński, 2001), and questionnaire \"Work conditions\" (developed in CIOPPIB). These studies have shown which factors determine their health behavior. The positive health behaviors of men were associated with good economic status, high self-assessment of care for health, positive opinions about life and work, and masculinity. They were also white-collar workers with good work ability."

Yet, there is little knowledge about the impact of the context of use on the usability outcome. It is specified in the usability standard (ISO 9241-11, 2018) of a device that it may be affected by its context of use and especially by the characteristics of its users. Among these, prior health knowledge (ie, knowledge about human body functioning) is crucial. However, no study has shown that prior health knowledge influences the usability of medical devices. Our study aimed to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between the usability of two home medical devices (soon to be used in the context of ambulatory surgery) and prior health knowledge through an experimental approach. For assessing the usability of two home medical devices (blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter), user tests were conducted among 149 students. A mixed-methods approach (subjective vs objective) using a variety of standard instruments was adopted (direct observation, video analysis, and questionnaires). Participants completed a questionnaire to show the extent of their previous health knowledge and then operated both devices randomly. Efficiency (ie, handling time) and effectiveness (ie, number of handling errors) measures were collected by video analysis. Satisfaction measures were collected by a questionnaire (system usability scale [SUS]). The qualitative observational data were coded using inductive analysis by two independent researchers specialized in cognitive psychology and cognitive ergonomics. Correlational analyses and clusters were performed to test how usability relates to sociodemographic characteristics and prior health knowledge. The results indicated a lack of usability for both devices. Regarding the blood pressure monitor (137 participants), users made approximately 0.77 errors (SD 1.49), and the mean SUS score was 72.4 (SD 21.07), which is considered \"satisfactory.\" The pulse oximeter (147 participants) appeared easier to use, but participants made more errors (mean 0.99, SD 0.92), and the mean SUS score was 71.52 (SD 17.29), which is considered \"satisfactory.\" The results showed a low negative and significant correlation only between the effectiveness of the two devices and previous knowledge (blood pressure monitor: r=-0.191, P=.03; pulse oximeter: r=-0.263, P=.001). More subtly, we experimentally identified the existence of a threshold level (χ² This study has the following two contributions: (1) a theoretical interest highlighting the importance of user characteristics including prior health knowledge on usability outcomes and (2) an applied interest to provide recommendations to designers and medical staff."

We aimed to assess and make cross-country and cross-region comparisons of the global impacts of COVID-19 and preparation preferences of pandemic. We recruited adults in 30 countries covering all World Health Organization (WHO) regions from July 2020 to August 2021. 5 Likert-point scales were used to measure their perceived change in 32 aspects due to COVID-19 (-2 = substantially reduced to 2 = substantially increased) and perceived importance of 13 preparations (1 = not important to 5 = extremely important). Samples were stratified by age and gender in the corresponding countries. Multidimensional preference analysis displays disparities between 30 countries, WHO regions, economic development levels, and COVID-19 severity levels. 16 512 adults participated, with 10 351 females. Among 32 aspects of impact, the most affected were having a meal at home (mean (m) = 0.84, standard error (SE) = 0.01), cooking at home (m = 0.78, SE = 0.01), social activities (m = -0.68, SE = 0.01), duration of screen time (m = 0.67, SE = 0.01), and duration of sitting (m = 0.59, SE = 0.01). Alcohol (m = -0.36, SE = 0.01) and tobacco (m = -0.38, SE = 0.01) consumption declined moderately. Among 13 preparations, respondents rated medicine delivery (m = 3.50, SE = 0.01), getting prescribed medicine in a hospital visit / follow-up in a community pharmacy (m = 3.37, SE = 0.01), and online shopping (m = 3.33, SE = 0.02) as the most important. The multidimensional preference analysis showed the European Region, Region of the Americas, Western Pacific Region and countries with a high-income level or medium to high COVID-19 severity were more adversely impacted on sitting and screen time duration and social activities, whereas other regions and countries experienced more cooking and eating at home. Countries with a high-income level or medium to high COVID-19 severity reported higher perceived mental burden and emotional distress. Except for low- and lower-middle-income countries, medicine delivery was always prioritised. Global increasing sitting and screen time and limiting social activities deserve as much attention as mental health. Besides, the pandemic has ushered in a notable enhancement in lifestyle of home cooking and eating, while simultaneously reducing the consumption of tobacco and alcohol. A health care system and technological infrastructure that facilitate medicine delivery, medicine prescription, and online shopping are priorities for coping with future pandemics."

This systematic literature review summarises the influencing factors of ICT-based remote e-working (device types, duration of use, user interfaces, etc.) on the physical health (musculoskeletal system and eyes) of knowledge workers. A search in four electronic databases and a manual search in four German journals resulted in 21 articles being included in this review. A bias analysis was conducted for all articles. Unfavourable postures, inappropriate working devices and certain environmental factors may cause a range of physical complaints, even after comparably short periods of time. Mostly, these complaints are greater compared to those experienced when working on a fully equipped stationary computer. Therefore, remote e-working requires careful planning, awareness, and the willingness to embrace working situations that counteract these problems. Different factors associated with remote e-working may influence physical health. This systematic literature review found that unfavourable postures, inappropriate working devices and certain environmental factors may cause physical complaints, even after short periods of time. Mostly, these complaints are greater compared to those experienced when working on a stationary computer."

        "abstract": "Residency training in anesthesiology involves care of hospitalized patients and necessitates overnight work, resulting in altered sleep patterns and sleep deprivation. Caffeine consumption is commonly used to improve alertness when fatigued after overnight work, in preparation for the commute home. We studied the impact of drinking a caffeinated energy drink (160 mg of caffeine) on driving performance in a high-fidelity, virtual reality driving simulator (Virginia Driving Safety Laboratory using the Driver Guidance System) in anesthesiology resident physicians immediately after 6 consecutive night-float shifts. Twenty-six residents participated and were randomized to either consume a caffeinated or noncaffeinated energy drink 60 minutes before the driving simulation session. After a subsequent week of night-float work, residents performed the same driving session (in a crossover fashion) with the opposite intervention. Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) testing was used to evaluate reaction time and lapses in attention. After 6 consecutive night-float shifts, anesthesiology residents who consumed a caffeinated energy drink had increased variability in driving for throttle, steering, and speed during the first 10 minutes of open-road driving but proceeded to demonstrate improved driving performance with fewer obstacle collisions (epoch 2: 0.65 vs 0.87; epoch 3: 0.47 vs 0.95; P = .03) in the final 30 minutes of driving as compared to driving performance after consumption of a noncaffeinated energy drink. Improved driving performance was most apparent during the last 30 minutes of the simulated drive in the caffeinated condition. Mean reaction time between the caffeine and noncaffeine states differed significantly (278.9 ± 29.1 vs 294.0 ± 36.3 milliseconds; P = .021), while the number of major lapses (0.09 ± 0.43 vs 0.27 ± 0.55; P = .257) and minor lapses (1.05 ± 1.39 vs 2.05 ± 3.06; P = .197) was not significantly different. After consuming a caffeinated energy drink on conclusion of 6 shifts of night-float work, anesthesiology residents had improved control of driving performance variables in a high-fidelity driving simulator, including a significant reduction in collisions as well as slightly faster reaction times."

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of newly diagnosed back pain among lecturers and undergraduates from a tertiary education centre during the COVID-19 lockdown and to identify the possible factors associated with this back pain. This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted among 1,500 lecturers and students of Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS). The questionnaire used was modified from previous studies on back pain. There were 346 newly diagnosed cases of back pain among students and lecturers of UMS. More than half of the participants (61.2%) suffered lower back pain in the lumbar region. There was a significant correlation between increased time of sitting and reduced exercise time, and the incidence of back pain. Poor ergonomic sitting conditions and poor perceived health conditions during the lockdown period also had a significant impact on the frequency of back pain. The university community has undergone a significant increase in sitting time and a decrease in exercise time during the lockdown. This has contributed to an increase in the frequency of back pain. It is recommended that further studies be done to guide the university community regarding the maintenance of exercise and management of sitting hours, in order to reduce the frequency of back pain."

        "abstract": "Frailty in older adults is a common multidimensional clinical entity, a state of vulnerability to stressors that increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as functional decline, institutionalization or death. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that anticipate the future inclusion of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥70 years in home care programmes (HC) and nursing homes (NH), and to develop the corresponding prediction models. A prospective cohort study was conducted in 23 primary healthcare centers located in Catalonia, Spain, with an eight-year follow-up (2005-2013). The cohort was made up of 616 individuals. Data collection included a baseline multidimensional assessment carried out by primary health care professionals. Outcome variables were collected during follow-up by consulting electronic healthcare records, and the Central Registry of Catalonia for mortality. A prognostic index for a HC and NH at 8 years was estimated for each patient. Death prior to these events was considered a competing risk event, and Fine-Gray regression models were used. At baseline, mean age was 76.4 years and 55.5% were women. During follow-up, 19.2% entered a HC program, 8.2% a NH, and 15.4% died without presenting an event. Of those who entered a NH, 31.5% had previously been in a HC program. Multivariate models for a HC and NH showed that the risk of a HC entry was associated with older age, dependence on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and slow gait measured by Timed-up-and-go test. An increased risk of being admitted to a NH was associated with older age, dependence on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, number of prescriptions, and the presence of social risk. Prognostic models based on comprehensive geriatric assessments can predict the need for the commencement of HC and NH admission in community-dwelling older adults. Our findings underline the necessity to measure functional capacity, mobility, number of prescriptions, and social aspects of older adults in primary healthcare centers. In such a setting they can be offered longitudinal holistic assessments so as to benefit from preventive actions in order to remain independent in the community for as long as possible."

Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18-65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI:  - 4.18 to  - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics. Further research should investigate the effect of social and psychological factors. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04169646.

The modified Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (mSAFFE), timed Up and Go test (TUG), four-stage Balance test (FSBT), and 30 seconds sit-to-stand test (30s-SST) were used. After twelve weeks, we found that the intervention group had better outcomes than the control group in mSAFFE, TUG, FSBT and 30s-SST (p<0.05). Also, we compared the pretest-posttest results within the two groups, respectively. We found that, within the intervention group, the outcomes of mSAFFE, TUG, FSBT, and 30s-SST become significantly better after twelve weeks, but within the control group, the outcomes of TUG, FSBT, and 30s-SST become significantly worse. Our findings demonstrated that a group-based OEP was feasible and acceptability among Chinese older adults living in nursing homes and the group-based OEP could improve FOF and physical function among those older adults."

However, given the rapid change from traditional ways of working, evidence is limited on the role of leaders, managers, and supervisors in supporting their employees' physical and mental health whilst WFH. The study aimed to examine the impact of leaders through their management of psychosocial working conditions on employees' stress and musculoskeletal pain (MSP) levels whilst WFH. Data from 965 participants (230 males, 729 females, 6 other) involved in the Employees Working from Home (EWFH) study, collected in October 2020, and April and November 2021, were analysed. Generalised mixed-effect models were used to test relationships between psychosocial leadership factors and employees' stress and MSP levels. Higher quantitative demands are associated with increased stress (B: 0.289, 95%CI 0.245, 0.333), presence of MSP (OR: 2.397, 95%CI 1.809, 3.177), and increased MSP levels (RR: 1.09, 95%CI 1.04, 1.14). Higher levels of vertical trust decreased stress (B: -0.094, 95%CI -0.135, -0.052) and presence of MSP (OR: 0.729, 95%CI 0.557, 0.954). Role clarity decreased stress (B: -0.055, 95%CI -0.104, -0.007) and levels of MSP (RR: 0.93, 95%CI 0.89, 0.96). Working with interruptions was associated with increased stress (B: 0.199, 95%CI 0.119, 0.280) and MSP (OR: 1.834, 95%CI 1.094, 3.072).

In total, 96 eligible municipalities were randomly assigned to either the control group or one of two interventions: (1) labour inspection visits, based on the LIA's standard inspections; and (2) guidance-through-workshops, where the participating services highlighted issues and trained labour inspectors provided guidance based on existing labour laws and regulations. No favourable intervention effect was observed for the inspection intervention. No effects were observed for most of the variables in the guidance intervention, although an effect was observed for the following psychosocial factors: decision control, control over work intensity and empowering leadership. However, after adjusting for multiple testing, none of the observed effects were statistically significant. Labour inspections did not affect psychosocial and biomechanical work factors in the home care services. A favourable effect of the guidance intervention on psychosocial work factors was observed.

Sixteen questionnaires were received, and 12 respondents supplied photos. Home and office workplace differences varied. Ten felt productivity was affected, most often positively. Four noted increased pain or fatigue intensity, particularly in the eyes, neck / head, lower back, and shoulders.

Fourteen participants communicated regularly by telephone, eight only for moderate duration and ten using adapted telephone equipment. Half of the ROSA scores were high. Workers forced into telework during the pandemic experience positive and negative impacts. Postures vary more than in offices, potentially increasing health risk."

The length of time that cognitive performance benefits are sustained following bouts of breaking up sitting (e.g., using sit-stand desks or walking) is not known. A narrative review of the literature was conducted using a systematic search strategy, with keywords related to breaking up sitting interventions in office-based environments and cognitive performance outcomes in the period immediately post the cessation of the breaking up sitting intervention. Three types of office-based breaking up sitting interventions were identified; 1) sit-stand desks, 2) walking desks and 3) cycling desks. From the eight studies which met the criteria, the impacts of these interventions on cognitive performance outcomes were mixed, with significant benefits in some studies and others reporting no benefit. Of the cognitive domains assessed, working memory, attention, and psychomotor function showed significant sustained improvement for up to 30 minutes post intervention. While there are benefits to a key set of cognitive performance domains following breaking up sitting interventions in office-based settings, no studies have evaluated whether benefits to cognitive performance persist for longer than 30 minutes after the breaking up sitting intervention. Furthermore, specific applications of these cognitive benefits to tasks outside of work (e.g., driving home from work) are unknown."

Therefore, a cross-sectional study was performed on 58 geriatrics divided into 3 age groups, who were clinically examined and answered the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire. Very high rates of complete edentulism in the oldest-old subgroup (bimaxillary in 64.3%; mandibular in 64.3%; maxillary in 85.7%), and alarming frequencies in the other subgroups (middle-old and youngest-old), statistically significant differences between age groups being determined. The OHIP-14 mean score was 14.5. Although not statistically significant, females had higher OHIP-14 scores, also middle-old with single maxillary arch, single mandibular arch, and bimaxillary complete edentulism, whether they wore dentures or not, but especially those without dental prosthetic treatment in the maxilla. A worse OHRQoL was also observed in wearers of bimaxillary complete dentures, in correlation with periodontal disease-related edentulism, in those with tertiary education degree, and those who came from rural areas. There were no statistically significant correlations of OHRQoL with age, total number of edentulous spaces or edentulous spaces with no prosthetic treatment. In conclusion, despite poor oral health and prosthetic status of the institutionalized elderly around Bucharest, the impact on their wellbeing is comparatively moderate."

        "abstract": "Social isolation is a common phenomenon among the elderly. Retirement, widowhood, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group lead to a decline in social relationships, which in turn has adverse consequences on health and well-being. The coronavirus COVID-19 crisis worsened this situation, raising interest for mobile telepresence robots (MTR) that would help create, maintain, and strengthen social relationships. MTR are tools equipped with a camera, monitor, microphone, and speaker, with a body on wheels that allows for remote-controlled and sometimes autonomous movement aiming to provide easy access to assistance and networking services. We conducted a narrative review of literature describing experimental studies of MTR involving elderly people over the last 20 years, including during the COVID-19 period. The aim of this review was to examine whether MTR use was beneficial for reducing loneliness and social isolation among older adults at home and in health and care institutions and to examine the current benefits and barriers to their use and implementation. We screened 1754 references and included 24 research papers focusing on the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of MTR. News reports on MTR use during the COVID-19 period were also examined. A qualitative, multidimensional analysis methodology inspired by a health technology assessment model was used to identify facilitating and limiting factors and investigate if and how MTR could reduce social isolation in elderly people. Reviewed studies provide encouraging evidence that MTR have potential in this regard, as experiments report positive feedback on MTR design and core functionalities. However, our analysis also points to specific technical, ergonomic, and ethical challenges that remain to be solved, highlighting the need for further multidimensional research on the design and impact of MTR interventions for older adults and building on new insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Accordingly, we developed a rapid health impact assessment (HIA) to evaluate positive and negative health effects of telework on these groups and recommended easily implementable countermeasures. Immediately after an emergency was declared in Japan, we implemented a rapid, five-step HIA. We screened and categorized health effects of telework for the three above-mentioned groups, extracting their content, directionality, and likelihood. Following a scoping exercise to determine the HIA's overall implementation, five experienced occupational health physicians appraised and prioritized the screened items and added new items. We outlined specific countermeasures and disseminated the results on our website. A short-term evaluation was conducted by three external occupational health physicians and three nurses. Following screening and appraisal, 59, 29, and 27 items were listed for teleworkers, non-teleworkers, and family members of teleworkers, respectively, covering work, lifestyle, disease and medical care, and home and community. Targeted countermeasures focused on the work environment, business management, communications, and lifestyles for teleworkers; safety and medical guidelines, work prioritization, and regular communication for non-teleworkers; and shared responsibilities within families and communication outside families for family members of teleworkers. The HIA's validity and the countermeasures' practical applicability were confirmed by the external evaluators. They can be easily applied and adapted across diverse industries to mitigate the wider negative effects of telework and enhance its positive effects."

This qualitative descriptive study used structured interviews that were completed during a randomized trial of non-pharmacological management of spine-related disability with chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy and exercise. Dual coders conducted a descriptive thematic analysis of 50 randomly selected transcripts supported by qualitative data management software. The Common-Sense Model provided an organizing framework for coding and interpretation. Fifty participants (34 women, median age: 68 years) described 4 illness representations, 4 coping styles, and 6 coping strategies for their management of spinal disability. Illness representations formed a continuum of little-to-no health impact to bothersome symptoms to heightened symptom intensity to unmanaged pain and/or disability. Most participants adopted either self-care or self-management coping styles, but some used healthcare-seeking or fear avoidance with worsening symptoms or interference with employment or preferred activities. Participants mentioned 6 coping strategies for spinal disability. Distraction included position changes, hobbies, and supportive relationships. Limitation focused on rest and/or relaxation, restricted movements, and activity modifications. Prevention enhanced self-care knowledge, posture and/or ergonomics, nutrition, and stress management. Movement emphasized stretching, home exercise and/or walking, and exercise therapy. Palliation augmented patient comfort through the use of heat and/or ice, over-the-counter medicine, and spinal manipulation. Avoidance strategies included missing employment, stopping house and/or yard work, and prescription medication. The community-dwelling older adults in this study offered varied illness representations of their chronic spinal disability. Most participants combined and personalized coping strategies to minimize pain and symptom impact; thus, representations may influence the coping styles adopted by older persons to manage their spinal conditions. A quote from a participant that pain was \"a thought in the back of my mind\" suggests the presence of cognitive and emotional processes that may influence individual perceptions and feelings about their spinal symptoms or conditions. These findings suggest that there may be a broader role for spine care clinicians to include teaching older people about self-management strategies to better cope with spinal disabilities."

Evidence from mechanistic and human data suggests that occupational exposure to ergonomic (or physical) risk factors may cause osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases (excluding rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and back and neck pain). In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of occupational exposure to physical ergonomic risk factors for estimating the number of disability-adjusted life years from these diseases that are attributable to exposure to this risk factor, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the prevalence of occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors for osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases. We searched electronic bibliographic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CISDOC. We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consulted additional experts. We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. The exposure was defined as any occupational exposure to one or more of: force exertion, demanding posture, repetitive movement, hand-arm vibration, kneeling or squatting, lifting, and/or climbing. We included all study types with an estimate of the prevalence of occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors. At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. We combined prevalence estimates using random-effect meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the ROB-SPEO tool and QoE-SPEO approach developed specifically for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. Five studies (three cross-sectional studies and two cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising 150,895 participants (81,613 females) in 36 countries in two WHO regions (Africa, Europe). The exposure was generally assessed with questionnaire data about self-reported exposure. Estimates of the prevalence of occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors are presented for all five included studies, disaggregated by country, sex, 5-year age group, industrial sector or occupational group where feasible. The pooled prevalence of any occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.84, 3 studies, 148,433 participants, 35 countries in the WHO Europe region, I Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors is highly prevalent. The current body of evidence is, however, limited, especially by risk of bias and indirectness. Producing estimates for the burden of disease attributable to occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review may perhaps be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

We systematically searched CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed and Psychinfo databases from inception to September 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed the articles and evaluated the methodological quality using PEDro. Thirty-five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. There were nine high-quality studies involving 555 participants. The meta-analysis revealed significant differences favouring the use of rubber pillows to reduce neck pain [standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.263; P < 0.001). Moreover, waking pain (SMD: -0.228; P < 0.001) and neck disability (SMD: -0.506; P = 0.020) were reduced while the satisfaction rate was enhanced (SMD: 1.144; P < 0.001) with pillow use. Pillow designs did not influence sleep quality (SMD = 0.047; P = 0.703) in patients with chronic neck pain. The use of spring and rubber pillows are effective in reducing neck pain, waking symptoms, and disability and enhancing pillow satisfaction in patients with chronic neck pain. Moreover, there may be no change in the alignment of the cervical spine in the side-lying position, regardless of the use of rubber or feather pillows. Rather, the cervical alignment may be significantly impacted by the shape and height of the pillow."

Interventions that promote occupational standing or walking have been found to reduce occupational sedentary time, but it is unclear whether these interventions ameliorate musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers. To investigate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, OSH UPDATE, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to January 2019. We also screened reference lists of primary studies and contacted experts to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), quasi RCTs, and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies of interventions to reduce or break up workplace sitting by encouraging standing or walking in the workplace among workers with musculoskeletal symptoms. The primary outcome was self-reported intensity or presence of musculoskeletal symptoms by body region and the impact of musculoskeletal symptoms such as pain-related disability. We considered work performance and productivity, sickness absenteeism, and adverse events such as venous disorders or perinatal complications as secondary outcomes. Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for study eligibility. These review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to request additional data when required. We used GRADE considerations to assess the quality of evidence provided by studies that contributed to the meta-analyses. We found ten studies including three RCTs, five cluster RCTs, and two CBA studies with a total of 955 participants, all from high-income countries. Interventions targeted changes to the physical work environment such as provision of sit-stand or treadmill workstations (four studies), an activity tracker (two studies) for use in individual approaches, and multi-component interventions (five studies). We did not find any studies that specifically targeted only the organisational level components. Two studies assessed pain-related disability. Physical work environment There was no significant difference in the intensity of low back symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.80 to 0.10; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) nor in the intensity of upper back symptoms (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -.096 to 0.00; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) in the short term (less than six months) for interventions using sit-stand workstations compared to no intervention. No studies examined discomfort outcomes at medium (six to less than 12 months) or long term (12 months and more). No significant reduction in pain-related disability was noted when a sit-stand workstation was used compared to when no intervention was provided in the medium term (mean difference (MD) -0.4, 95% CI -2.70 to 1.90; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). Individual approach There was no significant difference in the intensity or presence of low back symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.77; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.78; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), or elbow/wrist and hand symptoms (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions involving an activity tracker compared to an alternative intervention or no intervention in the short term. No studies provided outcomes at medium term, and only one study examined outcomes at long term. Organisational level No studies evaluated the effects of interventions solely targeted at the organisational level. Multi-component approach There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.27; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.80; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the short term. Only one RCT examined outcomes at medium term and found no significant difference in low back symptoms (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.95 to 1.15; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (MD -0.70, 95% CI -2.12 to 0.72; low-quality evidence), and leg symptoms (MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.49 to 0.89; low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.40; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; two RCTs; low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the long term. There was a statistically significant reduction in pain-related disability following a multi-component intervention compared to no intervention in the medium term (MD -8.80, 95% CI -17.46 to -0.14; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). Currently available limited evidence does not show that interventions to increase standing or walking in the workplace reduced musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers at short-, medium-, or long-term follow up. The quality of evidence is low or very low, largely due to study design and small sample sizes. Although the results of this review are not statistically significant, some interventions targeting the physical work environment are suggestive of an intervention effect. Therefore, in the future, larger cluster-RCTs recruiting participants with baseline musculoskeletal symptoms and long-term outcomes are needed to determine whether interventions to increase standing or walking can reduce musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers and can be sustained over time."

This study was aimed to synthesis literature that assessed the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions on MSK health. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the review: the condition being considered was MSK health, the intervention was COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions, cross sectional studies, cohort studies, case controlled, prospective studies and retrospective studies. Data were extracted by 2 independent researchers. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Evidence from included studies was summarised using narrative synthesis. Fourteen studies comprising 22,471 participants of the general population from Turkey (n = 5), Italy (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 2), Jordan (n = 1), Bangladesh (n = 1), Estonia (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1) and Saudi Arabia (n = 1) have met the inclusion criteria. The sample size of populations studied ranged from 91 to 1054. The included studies used questionnaire, visual analogic scale, or growth mixture modelling. Except for one study, all the included studies reported increased prevalence and incidence of MSK disorders due to COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions. The findings suggest that COVID-19 related lockdown restriction led to increased MSK disorders. Home-based strategies such as physical activity programmes and ergonomic workspace could potentially guide public health authorities to avoid MSK health problem."

        "abstract": "Surgical-related injuries are frequent, in fact the reported percentage of musculoskeletal disorders in surgeons is between 47% and 87%. These conditions are caused by long periods of standing, incorrect postures, repeated movements, little rest between operations, the lack of integrated operator rooms, the correct number and arrangement of monitors and the use of non-ergonomic instruments. This survey aims to assess the Italian overview both highlighting how prevalent surgical-related injury is in our surgeons and whether there is an operating room ergonomics education program in Italian surgical specialty schools. An anonymous questionnaire was designed through SurveyMonkey© web application. This survey was composed of 3 different sections concerning the general characteristics of the participants, their surgical background and any training performed, and any injuries or ailments related to the surgical activity. The survey was carried out in the period 1th of December 2022 and the 6th of February 2023. At the close of our survey, 300 responses were collected. Among the participants, the two most represented specialties were Gynecology and Obstetrics (42.3%) and General Surgery (39.7%) and surgeons were mainly employed in the Northern regions of Italy (54.8%). Analyzing the participants' background, 61.7% of the respondents had laparoscopic training during their training and only 53.1% had a pelvic trainer during their residency. In accordance with 98.7% of the respondents, during surgery we have the feeling of being in an uncomfortable position that causes discomfort or muscle pain, and regarding the frequency of these discomforts, the majority of our study population experiences these problems monthly (46.2%), while in 29.6% it is experienced weekly, 12.1% annually and finally 12.1% daily. The surgical approach that is most correlated with these disorders is laparoscopy (62.7%) while the one that causes the least discomfort is robotic surgery (1.4%). These discomforts cause 43.9% of our population to take a break or do short exercises to reduce pain during surgery, and the body areas most affected are the back (61.6%), neck (40.6%) and shoulders (37.8%). Despite this, our survey allows us to highlight some now-known gaps present in the surgical training program of our schools and the lack of protection toward our surgeons during their long career."

Little is known about the working conditions at home and its impact on the employee's occupational health. This systematic review examines the working conditions at employees' homes, the work-related disorders associated with working from home, organizations' perceptions of ergonomics at home and how they support their teleworkers. A search of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Open Grey, Pedro, PsychInfo, PubPsych, Scopus and Web of Science) was performed. Twelve studies were included in this review. The findings highlight the lack of ergonomic working conditions for home-based teleworkers. Furthermore, the results underline organizations' lack of awareness regarding home-based policies, ergonomics programs and the health-related consequences associated with the absence of ergonomic support. These findings suggest that home-based teleworkers have increased health risks. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that most of the included studies reported teleworkers who have experienced musculoskeletal issues. These results underline the necessity for implementing ergonomic design recommendations, especially for working at home. Further research is needed to understand the impact of ergonomics programs and workplace design for working at home."

Physically, surgeons are at risk of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms due to the nature of their work, and this risk can be impacted by theater environment, equipment design, and workload. Many symptoms will be self-limiting, but work related musculoskeletal symptoms can lead to the development of an injury, which can have far reaching effects, including the need for medical or surgical treatment, time away from work, or a change in clinical duties. Additionally, surgery can place a significant cognitive workload on the lead operator and this can be exacerbated, or alleviated, by the surgical environment, experience of the assistance, surgical modality, and case complexity. Measuring and quantifying the impact of surgery on the surgeon is a challenging undertaking. Tools such as motion capture, physiological markers, including heart rate variability and salivary cortisol, and questionnaires can provide insights into understanding the overall impact of surgery on the surgeon. A holistic approach that incorporates injury prevention strategies, communication, and support, is vital in assessing and mitigating risk factors. Injury prevention assessment tools and interventions that can be used within the busy surgical environment are needed, alongside increased ergonomic awareness. Addressing the impact of surgery on the surgeon is a multifaceted challenge, and long term positive changes can only be sustained with the support of the whole surgical team and healthcare organizations by developing and maintaining a supportive working environment."

The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of two-year distance learning on the physical activity and musculoskeletal health of university students. This was a national, cross-sectional study using data collected via an online questionnaire distributed through university communication platforms, which included questions on online education routines, musculoskeletal health, and physical activity of university students. In total, 1,366 students (65% female, 35% male) from 11 universities took part in the survey. The most common sites of reported pain were the neck (59.5%), shoulders (22.8%), back (29%), and low back (66.7%). Musculoskeletal pain significantly increased during the lockdown, according to the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (before: 2.7 ± 1.6; during: 5.5 ± 2.2, p<0.001). Everyday pain was referred by significantly more students during the lockdown (4.5% vs 36.1 %, p<0.001), while the percentage of asymptomatic students was significantly decreased (40.5% vs 6.1%, p<0.001). Concerning physical activity, the percentage of students who did not exercise significantly increased during the lockdown (15.1% vs 23.2%, p<0.001). Distance learning and total screen time were positively correlated with VAS for pain scores. On the contrary, an increased frequency of ergonomic position, walking intervals, and physical activity was associated with significantly decreased VAS for pain scores. Distance learning and limited physical activity led to a significant increase in musculoskeletal pain in university students, while exercise and ergonomic body position were considered protective factors. Interventions to encourage physical activity and healthy studying habits should be developed by universities, since distance learning may be again necessary for the future."

Data was collected via a questionnaire administered prior to the start of and during the study. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. All dentists self-reported to be in good to excellent health and only 50% sought medical treatment for work-related discomfort and pain. Thirteen of 14 reported being at least occasionally mentally and physically exhausted after work. A musculoskeletal disorder-work hour relationship model was created. Feedback given was linked to four psychosocial factors -job demand, job control, social interactions, and job future and career issues. The dental profession is considered a highly cognitive profession where much attention has been placed on the physical demands due to awkward postures. While physical demands are validated, additional research will further validate the link between psychosocial and mental and physical demands."

        "abstract": "Telework has become considerably more common during the ongoing pandemic. Although working remotely may have numerous advantages, negative impacts on workers' health and safety should also be considered. Telework is a major contributor to the development or aggravation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders where unsuited workstation ergonomics, sedentary behavior, as well as psychosocial and organizational factors play a role. This paper aims to identify telework-related risks and their impact on musculoskeletal health as well as provide recommendations that may be useful in constructing future preventive measures. A comprehensive literature search regarding the topic has been performed. Teleworkers experience musculoskeletal pain and discomfort mostly in low back area, neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. Poor ergonomic solutions when it comes to workstation design resulting in prolonged sitting in non-neutral positions contribute to the development and aggravation of musculoskeletal disorders in teleworkers. Working with inadequately placed screens and laptops and sitting in maladjusted seats without usual functionalities and ergonomic support is associated with musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. Extended working hours with fewer rest periods to meet increased work demands, social isolation, and lack of support from work colleagues and superiors as well as blurred work-home boundaries and omnipresence of work are commonly stated psychosocial and organizational factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Environmental factors such as poor lighting and glare, inadequate room temperature, and ventilation or noise, are frequently overlooked remote workstation risk factors. For a certain part of workers, telework will remain a common way of work in the post-pandemic period. Therefore, it is essential to identify telework-related risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders and address them with timely preventive measures tailored to each remote workstation's risks and individual workers' needs."

Following a dedicated screening process and critical appraisal, data from the final articles informing this review were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised. Of 19,614 identified articles, 50 articles informed this review. Representing 16 countries, the most common populations investigated were military and firefighter populations, but a wide range of general occupations (e.g., shipping, mining, hairdressing, and healthcare workers) were represented. Footwear types included work safety boots/shoes (e.g., industrial, gumboots, steel capped, etc.), military and firefighter boots, sports shoes (trainers, tennis, basketball, etc.) and various other types (e.g., sandals, etc.). Occupational footwear was found to impact gait and angular velocities, joint ranges of motion, posture and balance, physiological measures (like aerobic capacity, heart rates, temperatures, etc.), muscle activity, and selected occupational tasks. Occupational footwear associated with injuries included boots, conventional running shoes, shoes with inserts, harder/stiffer outsoles or thin soles, and shoes with low comfort scores-although the findings were mixed. Occupational footwear was also linked to potentially causing injuries directly (e.g., musculoskeletal injuries) as well as leading to mechanisms associated with causing injuries (like tripping and slipping)."

These conditions, as well as other work-related disorders, generate costs associated with treatment and work absence, which makes it a growing problem in industrialized countries. Available data from studies on individual populations of workers indicate a higher incidence of certain symptoms in these groups. Due to the lack of studies on the general population, we aimed to perform the preliminary study evaluating the occurrence of pain and work-related conditions depending on the type of occupational work among Polish employees to identify further possible areas for research. Data was collected using an electronic self-administered questionnaire, which was distributed in groups bringing together various professionals. The data obtained from 379 participants have been analyzed and divided according to performed work into sedentary, forced posture, standing, physical and requiring physical activity. Our study reveals a correlation between the frequency of work-related disorders and type of work performed in the Polish population. A significant correlation between the type of occupational work and prevalence of ankle, knee and shoulder pain, as well as heavy legs or upper limb paresthesia was found. According to our findings, female employees may be more vulnerable to lower limb symptoms. A place of residence also seems to affect the prevalence of upper back pain and heavy legs. The analysis also showed a correlation between the occurrence of hip, knee and ankle pain and the level of education of the participants. Surprisingly, lower extremity paresthesia was significantly more common among participants undertaking additional physical activity, compared to non-physically active respondents."

These injuries result in lost workdays, medical costs, and decreased productivity, all which impact emergency response systems. This study serves to assess the causes, costs, and disability of common work-related musculoskeletal injuries within the police, emergency medical service (EMS) workers, and firefighters of Ohio based on data from the OBWC (Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation). Our dataset included all OBWC injury claims involving a shoulder, low back, or knee from 2010 through 2014. Police and Firefighter leaders were analyzed separately from those not in a leadership role, and workers with combined Firefighter/EMS roles were analyzed separately from \"pure\" Firefighters and EMS personnel. Data were organized through univariate analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey tests and analyzed based on the job of the individual and whether the individual was in a leadership role. Police Officers had the highest number of total injuries in the dataset, followed by Firefighters and Firefighters/EMS workers. Police Officers and Firefighters injured their back and knees more often than their shoulders, while EMS workers injured their backs and shoulders more often than their knees. The mechanisms through which injuries occur are also dependent on the job. Police officers experienced a higher percentage of motor vehicle related back problems, while firefighters had a higher percentage of injuries from overexertion. Musculoskeletal injury claims in these emergency personnel resulted in opioid prescriptions approximately 10%of the time."

The article aims to assess the need for dental ergonomics modules as an integrated part of the dental school curriculum and to quantify the significance and role of ergonomics in reducing musculoskeletal stress generated while undergoing dental training. The study design consisted of a three-part original close-ended multiple-choice questionnaire carried out among 75 sixth year students from \"Victor Babeş\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timişoara, Romania. Questions focused on the basic knowledge of theoretical ergonomics, the ISO 11226 standard and means of improvement in undergraduate ergonomics training. Most students had an average level of knowledge regarding dental ergonomic principles. Data analysis showed that 62.16% agree that the information received in the second-year dental ergonomics course was helpful in regard to time organization. A high percentage (86%) also understood the correct positioning of the patient while performing dental procedures. Although implementation of ergonomic principles in the early dental training years has a high influence in the prevention of MSDs, students do not fully understand the impact this subject has on their future careers."

There is a lack of appropriate surgical instrumentation geared toward smaller hand sizes. Maintaining a neutral position while operating, frequent changes in position, and increased awareness can contribute to decreasing the detrimental impact on surgeons' bodies from performing operations."

Not all plasterer's tasks comprise of movements that will be supported by the exoskeleton and might even be hindered. Furthermore, use in practice might be jeopardised by time pressure, colleagues being negative, discomfort, or any other hindrance of the exoskeleton. We set up a field study, in which 39 plasterers were equipped with an exoskeleton for six weeks, to study exoskeleton usage. Moreover, we studied workload and fatigue, behaviour, productivity and quality, advantages and disadvantages, and acceptance. Exoskeleton use was dependent on the task performed but did not change over the course of the six weeks. For three tasks, higher exoskeleton use was associated with lower perceived loads, although differences were small. Advantages outweighed disadvantages for the majority of our population. This study shows that a majority of plasterers will wear the exoskeleton and is enthusiastic about the load reducing effect."

Among teachers, the prevalence of MSD has raised concerns globally, impacting their daily activities and overall quality of life. Buraidah and Saudi Arabia, like many other regions, face the implications of this issue. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and associated risk factors of MSD among teachers in Buraydah, providing valuable insights into the extent of the problem and potential areas for intervention. An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted for three months, from April 1 to June 30, 2023, using the Arabic version of the standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire. This study was conducted in all schools in Buraydah City, Saudi Arabia. The study population was all schoolteachers (including principals, vice principals, etc.) in Buraydah City. The study analyzed responses from 648 teachers and 139 school workers using statistical tests, including chi-square tests and logistic regression models. The results indicated a notable prevalence of MSD among teachers, with a significant association found between age, gender, and major depressive disorder (MDD) and MSD. The study reveals that females are at higher risk of MSD compared to males, emphasizing the need for gender-specific interventions. Moreover, the presence of MDD is identified as a significant contributor to MSD among teachers. However, certain demographic and lifestyle factors, such as marital status, level of school, smoking habits, and fixed rest times, do not show significant associations with MSD. Although age and years of experience are correlated, only age is found to significantly contribute to MSD. Regular exercise and BMI also do not emerge as significant contributors, although a lack of exercise shows a marginal impact. This study's findings have implications for educational institutions and policymakers, highlighting the need for tailored interventions to address MSD among teachers. It underscores the importance of ergonomic interventions, gender-sensitive approaches, and mental health support."

Here, we review the existing literature and propose recommendations to improve physical preparedness for surgery both in and outside the operating room. For decades, cardiothoracic surgeons have suffered from musculoskeletal pain, most commonly in the neck, and back due to a lack of proper ergonomics during surgery. A lack of dedicated ergonomics curriculum during training may leave surgeons at a high predisposition for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and other sources for studies relevant to surgical ergonomics and prevalence of musculoskeletal disease among surgeons and interventionalists. Whenever possible, data from quantitative studies, and meta-analyses are presented. We also contacted experts and propose an exercise routine to improve physical preparedness for demands of surgery. To date, many studies have reported astonishingly high rates of work-related pain in surgeons with rates as high as 87% in minimally-invasive surgeons. Several optimizations regarding correct table height, monitor positioning, and loupe angles have been discussed. Lastly, implementation of ergonomics training at some programs have been effective at reducing the rates of musculoskeletal pain among surgeons. Surgical work-related stress injuries are more common than we think. Many factors including smaller incisions and technological advancements have led to this plight. Ultimately, work-related injuries are underreported and understudied and the field of surgical ergonomics remains open for investigative study."

RCTs evaluating any intervention aiming to prevent future impact of LBP, reporting an outcome measure of LBP intensity and/or disability measured at least 3 months post-randomisation, and the intervention group must be compared with a group that received no intervention/placebo or minimal intervention. Trials restricting recruitment to participants with current LBP were excluded. 27 published reports of 25 different trials including a total of 8341 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled results, from three RCTs (612 participants), found moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme can prevent future LBP intensity (mean difference (MD) -4.50; 95% CI -7.26 to -1.74), and from 4 RCTs (471 participants) that an exercise and education programme can prevent future disability due to LBP (MD -6.28; 95% CI -9.51 to -3.06). It is uncertain whether prevention programmes improve future quality of life (QoL) and workability due to the overall low-quality and very low-quality available evidence. This review provides moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme, and a programme combining exercise and education, are effective to reduce future LBP intensity and associated disability. It is uncertain whether prevention programmes can improve future QoL and workability. Further high-quality RCTs evaluating prevention programmes aiming to reduce future impact of LBP are needed."

Two investigators systematically searched Cochrane, Pubmed, Scopus, and EBSCO databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Sixteen studies, with 3761 dental students, were included. The highest 7-day prevalence was in the lower back (27.2%; 95% CI 20-35), neck (27%; 95% CI 19.1-35.8), and upper back (24.2%; 95% CI 17.2-32). Yearly occurrence was mainly in the neck (51%; 95% CI 41-61), followed by shoulders (45.3%; 95% CI 37.6-53.1) and lower back (42%; 95% CI 34.1-50.2) and a fraction of these reported that symptoms in lower-back (15.2%; 95% CI 12.1-18.5), neck (13.9%; 95% CI 10.6-17.5) and shoulders (12.2%; 95% CI 8.7-16.3) affected work or normal activities. Associated contributing factors include female sex, poor posture habits, inadequate ergonomics knowledge, sedentary lifestyle, high physical activity levels, poor quality of life, and smoking. In contrast, engaging in physical exercise has positively impacted mitigating the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. WMSDs have a high prevalence among dental students, particularly in the cervicothoracic, lumbar, and shoulder regions, having a significant impact since training years. Further research with a multidimensional approach with psychosocial and physical assessments is recommended to understand this issue thoroughly."

Also, food production processes require intense manual labor and repetitive movements, which may result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Noise and awkward posture are considered as two important physical factors in the industrialized world, which can related to perceived stress. This study was conducted among food factory workers to investigate the impact of noise exposure and work posture on occupational stress. A total of 200 workers were examined in this cross-sectional study. Individual noise exposure was measured by TES-1354 dosimeter (TES, TW) according to ISO 9612. Postural risk and job stress levels were assessed using Quick Exposure Check (QEC), and the Osipow occupational stress questionnaire, respectively. The level of noise exposure and awkward posture were significantly associated with work-related stress.The relationship of gender with occupational stress was also statistically significant. Considering that the noise exposure and work posture factors are important determinants of work-related stress, a combined approach to eliminate the levels of non-standard noise and inappropriate posture is essential for promoting psychological health in food companies."

Research has been conducted on the joint torque individuals can produce, a quantity that indicates the ability of the person to carry out such repetitive movements. Most of the studies surround gait analysis, rehabilitation, the assessment of athletic performance, and robotics. The aim of this study is to develop a model that estimates the maximum shoulder and elbow joint torque an individual can produce based on anthropometrics and demographics without taking a manual measurement with a force gauge (dynamometer). Nineteen subjects took part in the study which recorded maximum shoulder and elbow joint torques using a dynamometer. Sex, age, body composition parameters, and anthropometric data were recorded, and relevant parameters which significantly contributed to joint torque were identified using regression techniques. Of the parameters measured, body mass index and upper forearm volume predominantly contribute to maximum torque for shoulder and elbow joints; coefficient of determination values were between 0.6 and 0.7 for the independent variables and were significant for maximum shoulder joint torque (P<0.001) and maximum elbow joint torque (P<0.005) models. Two expressions illustrated the impact of the relevant independent variables on maximum shoulder joint torque and maximum elbow joint torque, using multiple linear regression. Coefficient of determination values for the models were between 0.6 and 0.7. The models developed enable joint torque estimation for individuals using measurements that are quick and easy to acquire, without the use of a dynamometer. This information is useful for those employing joint torque data in biomechanics in the areas of health, rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational safety, and robotics. Clinical Relevance- The rapid estimation of arm joint torque without the direct force measurement can help occupational safety with the prevention of injury and musculoskeletal disorders in several working scenarios."

A total of 191 questionnaires were completed. The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 42.0 years (17.0 years) and 56.8% of participants were female. One hundred fifty participants (78.5%) self-reported the presence of musculoskeletal discomfort. Ergonomics parameters most commonly implemented included having monitors an arm's length away (82.6%) and hands being shoulder-width apart (77.1%). Binary logistic regression revealed participants either not having the top of the monitor screen at eye level when in a seated position or not having the wrists straight and relatively flat when using the mouse was associated with an increased likelihood of experience of musculoskeletal discomfort. The majority of participants (92.7%) self-reported their musculoskeletal discomfort to affect work productivity.

        "abstract": "Surgeon workload is significant both mentally and physically and may differ by procedure type. When comparing laparoscopic surgery and open surgery, studies have reported contrasting results on the physical and mental workload assessed. Wearable posture sensors and pre-/post-surgical questionnaires were employed to assess intraoperative workload and to identify risk factors for surgeons using objective and subjective measures. Data from 49 cases (27 open and 22 laparoscopic surgeries performed by 13 male and 11 female surgeons) were assessed. More than half the surgeons reported a clinically relevant post-surgical fatigue score. The surgeons also self-reported a significant increase in pain for the neck, upper back, and lower back during/after surgery. Procedural time had significant impacts on fatigue, body part pain, and subjective (NASA-TLX) workload. The objectively assessed intraoperative work postures using wearable sensors showed a high musculoskeletal risk for neck and lower back based on their posture overall. Open surgeries had significantly larger neck angles (median [IQR]: 40 [28-47]°) compared with laparoscopic surgeries (median [IQR]: 23 [16-29]°), p < 0.001) and torso (median [IQR]: 17 [14-22]° vs. 13 [10-17]°, p = 0.006). Surgeons reported significantly higher levels of fatigue and pain in the neck and lower back during or after performing a surgical case. Longer procedural time resulted in more self-rated fatigue, pain, and subjective workload. Open surgery had higher postural risk. Overall, surgeons spent a disturbingly high percentage of time during surgery in high-risk musculoskeletal postures, especially the neck. These results show that intraoperative postural risk is very high and that interventions are necessary to protect surgeon musculoskeletal health for optimal surgeon performance and career longevity."

It causes an unsafe and unpleasant working environment that directly impacts the quality of the product, workers' productivity, and effectiveness. This study aimed to give a specialized solution for tests and explore possible solutions to the given problem in neuroergonomics and human-robot interaction. The designed modular and adaptive laboratory model of the industrial assembly workstation represents the laboratory infrastructure for conducting advanced research in the field of ergonomics, neuroergonomics, and human-robot interaction. It meets the operator's anatomical, anthropometric, physiological, and biomechanical characteristics. Comparing standard, ergonomic, guided, and collaborative work will be possible based on workstation construction and integrated elements. These possibilities allow the industry to try, analyze, and get answers for an identified problem, the condition, habits, and behavior of operators in the workplace. The set-up includes a workstation with an industry work chair, a Poka-Yoke system, adequate lighting, an audio 5.0 system, containers with parts and tools, EEG devices (a cap and smartfones), an EMG device, touchscreen PC screen, and collaborative robot. The first phase of the neuroergonomic study was performed according to the most common industry tasks defined as manual, monotonous, and repetitive activities. Participants have a task to assemble the developed prototype model of an industrial product using prepared parts and elements, and instructed by the installed touchscreen PC. In the beginning, the participant gets all the necessary information about the experiment and gets 15 min of practice. After the introductory part, the EEG device is mounted and prepared for recording. The experiment starts with relaxing music for 5 min. The whole experiment lasts two sessions per 60 min each, with a 15 min break between the sessions. Based on the first experiments, it is possible to develop, construct, and conduct complex experiments for industrial purposes to improve the physical, cognitive, and organizational aspects and increase workers' productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It has highlighted the possibility of applying modular and adaptive ergonomic research laboratory experimental set-up to transform standard workplaces into the workplaces of the future."

However, there are limited studies in the literature examining the musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine musculoskeletal problems and psychological disorders in healthcare personnel working at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine and Research Hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and to come up with solutions for rehabilitation. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire (CMDQ) was used to assess musculoskeletal problems in the past week. Additionally, Beck depression inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate the psychological state of the participants. Questions on demographic characteristics, habits, the presence and localisation of musculoskeletal system (MSS) diseases, severity and duration of pain, chronic diseases, trauma history and working conditions were included in the questionnaire prepared by the researchers. The study included 74 nurses, 42 residents, 26 specialists, 24 technicians, 16 dentists, 12 physiotherapists, and 26 other allied health personnel. Dentists had the highest total CMDQ score (160.73) whereas resident doctors had the lowest total CMDQ score (98.33). Low back, neck and back pain were the most common MSS problems. BDI was highest in nurses and 70.27% of the nurses were women. The total workplace ergonomics score was found to be 25.91%, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) was highest in nurses (6.72). While MSS pain is concentrated on the waist, neck and back regions in all healthcare workers. We concluded that the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, delay in preventive measures such as vaccination and medication, rapid and strong transmission of the disease and increasing number of deaths have led to an increase in stress, depression and burnout among healthcare workers."

The oil sector is the largest and most economically relevant industry in Nigeria, yet the impact of WMSD on workers in this industry is unknown. To assess the prevalence, pattern and predictors of WMSD among oil workers in Nigeria. This exploratory study was conducted in oil producing companies in Nigeria. Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to assess WMSD, while risk factors and demographic variables were obtained through an interview. Obtained data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and logistic regression at α=0.05RESULTS:A total of 198 (138 male, 60 female) oil workers aged 40.3±10.1 years participated in this study. The prevalence of WMSD was 88.8%, and was most common around the low-back (51.5%), and neck (44.4%) regions. There was a significant association between WMSD and each of duration of service (X2 = 45.44, p = 0.020), awkward neck postures at work (X2 = 12.46, p = 0.006), inadequate training on injury prevention (X2 = 11.98, p = 0.007), and continuing to work while feeling discomfort (X2 = 10.83, p = 0.013). Post-hoc analysis revealed that being a male oil worker (OR = 1.17, p = 0.037) and continuing to work while feeling discomfort or pain (OR = 2.23, p = 0.048) were the significant predictors of WMSD. Approximately nine in every ten oil workers in Nigeria have a WMSD. Male gender and work persistence amidst discomfort or pain are the predictors of WMSD among oil workers in Nigeria. Ergonomics training and evaluation programme is recommended for workers in this industry."

This study assessed and compared health behaviour and work-related musculoskeletal pain among Polish physiotherapists and nurses. The study encompassed a group of 304 participants. The methodology consisted of a survey addressing pain-related questions and the Health Behaviour Inventory (HBI). The HBI evaluates health behaviour in four categories. The average HBI score was 5.05 (±1.96) points for physiotherapists and 4.50 (±1.86) points for nurses ( Both professional groups experience WRMSDs, with nurses suffering more regularly and severely. In contrast, physiotherapists exhibit superior health behaviour practices, potentially mitigating musculoskeletal pain.

        "abstract": "Currently, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a significant public health concern and are a leading cause of disability-adjusted life years and reduced quality of life worldwide. In developing countries, including Ethiopia, as a result of poor occupational health and safety practices and underreporting of the problems, work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been increased, remaining less prioritized, and there is no adequate evidence on the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, the current study aimed to determine and provide the overall prevalence of occupational-related upper and lower extremity musculoskeletal pain among the working population of Ethiopia. The current study considered full-text articles conducted in Ethiopia, written in English, and published from 2017 to 2020. Ten electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, MedNar, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online database were used to search the articles using a combination of Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, and NOT), Medical Subject Headings, and main keywords. The quality assessment of the articles was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools to determine the relevance of the article to the current study. Of the 1377 articles identified from the included electronic databases, 12 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The study found that the pooled prevalence of occupational-related elbow pain, wrist/hand pain, knee/leg pain, foot/ankle pain, and hip/thigh pain in the previous one year was 19.7% (95% CI: 12.3, 30.1), 24.2% (95% CI: 17.4, 32.7), 25.0% (95% CI: 18.5, 32.8), 20.2% (95% CI: 12.8, 30.4), and 15.5% (95% CI: 9.9, 23.4), respectively. Based on a subgroup analysis, the last year's pooled prevalence of occupational-related elbow, wrist/hand, knee/leg, foot/ankle, and hip/thigh pain was increased to 33.7% [95% CI: 31.9, 35.5], 29.7% [95% CI: 28.2, 31.2], 31.5% [95% CI: 29.9, 33.2], 30.6% [95% CI: 29.0, 32.4], and 27.3% [95% CI: 25.5, 29.2], respectively. Occupational-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to have a potential impact on workers' health and productivity. The current study found that the overall pooled prevalence of occupational-related upper and lower extremity musculoskeletal disorders in the last year ranged from 15.5 to 33.7%. Implementing occupational health and safety measures play an important role in preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders and other occupational hazards."

Intraoperative observations and survey study. Using the Rapid Entire Body Assessment score system to identify ergonomic hazards, we conducted intraoperative observations assessing operating room personnel during different otolaryngological subspecialty procedures. Based on these findings, otolaryngology surgeons at a single academic institution in the United States were sent a survey that evaluated ergonomic practice, environmental infrastructure, and prior ergonomic training or education. A response rate of 69% was obtained from 70 surgeons, with 72.9% of responding surgeons suffering from some level of back pain, with cervical spine pain being the most common. Interestingly, residents were equally affected when compared to more senior surgeons both in subjective survey reports and from observational risk analysis. Furthermore, 43.8% of surgeons reported suffering from the highest level of pain when standing, whereas only 12.5% experienced pain when sitting. Importantly, 10% stated that pain impacted their work. Only 24% of surgeons had any prior ergonomic training or education. Our data suggest that pain and disability induced by poor ergonomics are widespread among the otolaryngology community and confirm that surgeons rarely receive ergonomic training in the surgical context. Additionally, intraoperative observational findings identified that the majority of observed surgeons display poor posture, particularly a poor cervical angle and use of ergonomic setups, both of which increase ergonomic risk hazard. These data provide guidance for future interventional studies. NA Laryngoscope, 129:370-376, 2019."

The purposes of this study were to define the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) among dentists in the State of Kuwait, to identify risk factors for WMSD, and to explore relationships between WMSD and absenteeism/productivity. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to dentists at government, private, and academic dental clinics. A total of 186 questionnaires were returned (80% response rate). The results showed that 88 (47%) of responding dentists experienced WMSDs. Dentists self-reporting WMSD were older (36.4 (10.3) years vs. 32.6 (9.33); P = 0.01), in practice longer (11.7 (10.4) years vs. 8.2 (8.4); P = 0.013), and worked longer hours (34.9 (10.6) hours vs. 30.4 (11.5); P = 0.08) than dentists not reporting WMSD. A significant association was found between rating of pain and lost days from work (x2 (10, n = 85) = 20.96, ρ = 0.021). Dentists' occupational procedures expose their bodies to prolonged and awkward postures, thereby subjecting the dentists to unnatural forces and stresses on crucial movement and functioning joints. Cumulative exposures to such postures lead to WMSDs. Generally, WMSD has a considerable impact on the health and economic status of the individual, family, and workplace. WMSD increases absenteeism and reduces productivity."

Surgeons reported increased pain in the neck, upper, and lower back both during and after operations. High-stress intraoperative postures were also revealed by the real-time measurement in the neck and back. Surgical duration also impacted physical pain and fatigue. Open procedures had more stressful physical postures than laparoscopic procedures. Loupe usage negatively impacted neck postures.

The study aimed to describe musculoskeletal pain prevalence and the interplay between environmental conditions, lifestyle, and drugs consumed among Italian and Peruvian dentists. A 18 multiple choice questionnaire was administered to Peruvian and Italian dental care practitioners. A total of 187 questionnaires were submitted. One hundred sixty-seven questionnaires were selected for the analysis, including 86 questionnaires from Italy, and 81 from Perú. The study examined musculoskeletal pain presence in dental practitioners. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain presence was analyzed considering different parameters: gender, age, type of dental practitioners, specialization in dentistry, hours of work per day, years of work, physical activity, localization of musculoskeletal pain and the influence of musculoskeletal pain on the performance on work. The selected questionnaires for analysis were 167 (67 from Italy and 81 from Perú). Male and female participants were numerically equal. Most of the dental practitioners were dentists. The percentage of dentists who present musculoskeletal pain is 87.2% in Italy and 91.4% in Perú ( Musculoskeletal pain represents a very diffused condition in dental practitioners. The results about the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain show how the two populations (Italian and Peruvian) are very similar despite the geographical distance. Nevertheless, the high percentages of musculoskeletal pain in dental practitioners translate into the need to use solutions to reduce its onsets, such as improving ergonomics and physical activity."

This study characterizes selected plastic surgery procedures, with an attempt to identify high-risk procedures and procedural components as well as the impact of biofeedback on surgical ergonomics. A commercially available posture training device was used to initially record neck and spine positioning and later to send biofeedback to prompt surgeons to correct posture. Device data were correlated with in-person observations to characterize factors associated with more time spent in the slouched/nonneutral cervical and thoracic spine posture. The proportion of time spent in the upright position during surgery was significantly different among male and female participants, level of training, participant height, in the sitting versus nonsitting positioning (P < 0.001), with loupes use, and if there was more than an 8-inch height difference between 2 participants (mean, 0.70 ± 0.285). Using the device intervention, all participants spent a larger proportion of operating time upright. Half of these improvements in posture were statistically significant. While in feedback mode, participants experienced shorter and more frequent periods of slouching/nonneutral posture. When comparing the same participant performing the same procedure with and without device biofeedback, 72.2% of participants spent more time in the upright/neutral posture during the surgery when the device was sending feedback. Biofeedback devices used in the operating room can lead to improved surgical posture, which may translate to reduction of workplace injuries, and overall physician health. This study found that a commercially available posture training device and sitting stools in the operating room could significantly improve physician cervical and thoracic spine posture."

Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment predispose individuals to poor metabolic health and promote weight gain and have received increased research attention in the past 10 years. Insufficient sleep is defined as sleeping less than recommended for health benefits, whereas circadian misalignment is defined as wakefulness and food intake occurring when the internal circadian system is promoting sleep. This Review discusses the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in humans on appetite hormones (focusing on ghrelin, leptin and peptide-YY), energy expenditure, food intake and choice, and risk of obesity. Some potential strategies to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disruption on metabolic health are provided and future research priorities are highlighted. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic functions. Furthermore, modern working patterns, lifestyles and technologies are often not conducive to adequate sleep at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting it (for example, late-night screen time, shift work and nocturnal social activities). Efforts are needed to highlight the importance of optimal sleep and circadian health in the maintenance of metabolic health and body weight regulation."

Potential harmful effects of extensive screen time and technology use include heightened attention-deficit symptoms, impaired emotional and social intelligence, technology addiction, social isolation, impaired brain development, and disrupted sleep. However, various apps, videogames, and other online tools may benefit brain health.

A database search was done in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane and a total of 18 articles were collected. Extracted data from 4 articles were also analyzed using random-effect meta-analysis and meta-regression. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used in meta-analysis. Results from the study suggested that Trp supplementation can shorten wake after sleep onset (-81.03 min/g, P = 0.017; SMD, -1.08 min [95%CI, -1.89 to -0.28]). In addition, the group receiving ≥1 g Trp supplementation had a shorter wake after sleep onset than the group with Trp < 1g supplementation (Trp <1 g vs Trp ≥1 g: 56.55 vs 28.91 min; P = 0.001). However, Trp supplementation did not affect other sleep components. Trp supplementation, especially at ≥1 g can help improve sleep quality."

Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness."

Lack of sleep has shown to produce deficits in memory consolidation and plays an important role in brain development and brain plasticity in the several developmental stages of the human brain. At the cellular level, circadian cycles coordinate complex mechanism that \"turn on and off\" genes and cellular structures regulating individual cell functions to impact global organ and systems physiological activities. At the end a perfect and coordinated equilibrium in the mental, emotional and physiological is the goal of this complex process. Sleep impacts memory, learning, mood, behavior, immunological responses, metabolism, hormone levels, digestive process and many more physiological functions. We present a review of three basic aspects related with sleep: a. brain electrical activity during the sleep and neuroanatomic correlation with mechanism related with memory and learning; b. circadian cycles and impact in several physiological systems; c some examples of clinical disorders associated with sleep disorders and impact in learning and memory. Las investigaciones recientes demuestran que mientras estamos tranquilamente durmiendo nuestro cerebro está muy ocupado procesando la información obtenida a lo largo del día. Asimismo, la falta de sueño ocasiona problemas en la consolidación de la memoria. El sueño juega un papel fundamental en el adecuado desarrollo del cerebro en crecimiento y muchos de los fenómenos de plasticidad cerebral ocurren durante el sueño. A nivel celular, los ciclos circadianos coordinan complejos mecanismos de \"encender y apagar\" genes y estructuras que regulan individualmente y colectivamente las funciones de cada célula del organismo y a su vez de cada órgano, cada sistema fisiológico, para finalmente producir un perfecto equilibrio en el funcionamiento mental, emocional y sistémico del individuo. El sueño influye en los procesos de memoria, aprendizaje, estados de ánimo y comportamiento, en las respuestas inmunológicas, procesos metabólicos, niveles de hormonas, digestión y muchas más funciones fisiológicas.

        "abstract": "Sleep serves important biological functions, and influences health and longevity through endocrine and metabolic related systems. Sleep debt, circadian misalignment and sleep disruption from obstructive sleep apnea is widespread in modern society and accumulates with life because recovery sleep is not completely restorative. Accumulated disordered sleep throughout life impacts the ageing process and the development of age-related diseases. When epidemiological and interventional studies are considered collectively, sleep loss and lower sleep duration are associated with lower morning, afternoon and 24-h testosterone; as well as higher afternoon, but not morning or 24-h cortisol. These reciprocal changes imbalances anabolic-catabolic signaling because testosterone and cortisol are respectively the main anabolic and catabolic signals in man. Fixing testosterone-cortisol balance by means of a novel dual-hormone clamp mitigates the induction of insulin resistance by sleep restriction and provided the first proof-of-concept that the metabolic harm from sleep loss can be ameliorated by approaches that do not require sleeping more. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with lower testosterone, even after controlling for age and obesity whereas the conclusion that continuous positive airway pressure therapy has no effect on testosterone is premature because available studies are underpowered and better-quality studies suggest otherwise. High dose testosterone therapy induces OSA, but more physiological dosing may not; and this effect may be transient or may dissipate with longer term therapy. Studies investigating the origin of the diurnal testosterone rhythm, the effect of circadian misalignment on testosterone-cortisol balance, and methods to mitigate metabolic harm, are required."

We explore the associations of the physical environment (urban density, recreational facilities, green space, mixed land use, and healthy food stores), neighborhood deprivation (disadvantage and disorder), and the social environment (social cohesion, safety, and stigma) with sleep in both adult and pediatric populations. We investigate how physical and social environmental features may lead to alterations in the timing, duration, and quality of sleep and contribute to the most prevalent sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian rhythm disorders. We also review how ambient factors such as artificial light, environmental noise, and air pollution may contribute to sleep pathology.

Previous literature tends to support that SMU is associated with poor sleep and mental health issues in youth, despite some conflicting findings. In this scoping review, we summarized relevant studies published within the past 3 years, highlighted the impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, while also examined the possible underlying mechanisms involved. Future direction and intervention on rational use of SMU was discussed. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies demonstrated the negative impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health, with preliminary evidence indicating potential benefits especially during the COVID period at which social restriction was common. However, the limited longitudinal research has hindered the establishment of directionality and causality in the association among SMU, sleep, and mental health. Recent studies have made advances with a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, which is of public health importance and will contribute to improving sleep and mental health outcomes while promoting rational and beneficial SMU. Future research should include the implementation of cohort studies with representative samples to investigate the directionality and causality of the complex relationships among SMU, sleep, and mental health; the use of validated questionnaires and objective measurements; and the design of randomized controlled interventional trials to reduce overall and problematic SMU that will ultimately enhance sleep and mental health outcomes in youth."

        "abstract": "Light is necessary for life, and artificial light improves visual performance and safety, but there is an increasing concern of the potential health and environmental impacts of light. Findings from a number of studies suggest that mistimed light exposure disrupts the circadian rhythm in humans, potentially causing further health impacts. However, a variety of methods has been applied in individual experimental studies of light-induced circadian impacts, including definition of light exposure and outcomes. Thus, a systematic review is needed to synthesize the results. In addition, a review of the scientific evidence on the impacts of light on circadian rhythm is needed for developing an evaluation method of light pollution, i.e., the negative impacts of artificial light, in life cycle assessment (LCA). The current LCA practice does not have a method to evaluate the light pollution, neither in terms of human health nor the ecological impacts. The systematic literature survey was conducted by searching for two concepts: light and circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm was searched with additional terms of melatonin and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. The literature search resulted to 128 articles which were subjected to a data collection and analysis. Melatonin secretion was studied in 122 articles and REM sleep in 13 articles. The reports on melatonin secretion were divided into studies with specific light exposure (101 reports), usually in a controlled laboratory environment, and studies of prevailing light conditions typical at home or work environments (21 studies). Studies were generally conducted on adults in their twenties or thirties, but only very few studies experimented on children and elderly adults. Surprisingly many studies were conducted with a small sample size: 39 out of 128 studies were conducted with 10 or less subjects. The quality criteria of studies for more profound synthesis were a minimum sample size of 20 subjects and providing details of the light exposure (spectrum or wavelength; illuminance, irradiance or photon density). This resulted to 13 qualified studies on melatonin and 2 studies on REM sleep. Further analysis of these 15 reports indicated that a two-hour exposure to blue light (460 nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin, the maximum melatonin-suppressing effect being achieved at the shortest wavelengths (424 nm, violet). The melatonin concentration recovered rather rapidly, within 15 min from cessation of the exposure, suggesting a short-term or simultaneous impact of light exposure on the melatonin secretion. Melatonin secretion and suppression were reduced with age, but the light-induced circadian phase advance was not impaired with age. Light exposure in the evening, at night and in the morning affected the circadian phase of melatonin levels. In addition, even the longest wavelengths (631 nm, red) and intermittent light exposures induced circadian resetting responses, and exposure to low light levels (5-10 lux) at night when sleeping with eyes closed induced a circadian response. The review enables further development of an evaluation method of light pollution in LCA regarding the light-induced impacts on human circadian system."

Acute sleep deprivation and more chronic sleep restriction adversely affect individual health, impairing memory and cognitive performance as well as increasing the risk and progression of numerous diseases. In mammals, the hippocampus and hippocampus-dependent memory are vulnerable to the effects of acute sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation induces changes in molecular signaling, gene expression and may cause changes in dendritic structure in neurons. Genome wide studies have shown that acute sleep deprivation alters gene transcription, although the pool of genes affected varies between brain regions. More recently, advances in research have drawn attention to differences in gene regulation between the level of the transcriptome compared with the pool of mRNA associated with ribosomes for protein translation following sleep deprivation. Thus, in addition to transcriptional changes, sleep deprivation also affects downstream processes to alter protein translation. In this review, we focus on the multiple levels through which acute sleep deprivation impacts gene regulation, highlighting potential post-transcriptional and translational processes that may be affected by sleep deprivation. Understanding the multiple levels of gene regulation impacted by sleep deprivation is essential for future development of therapeutics that may mitigate the effects of sleep loss."

        "abstract": "This narrative review explores the impact of sleep and nutrition on injury risk in adolescent athletes. Sleep is viewed as essential to the recuperation process and is distinguished as an active participant in recovery through its involvement in growth, repair, regeneration, and immunity. Furthermore, the literature has shown that the sleep of athletes impacts elements of athletic performance including both physical and cognitive performance, recovery, injury risk, and mental well-being. For sleep to have a restorative effect on the body, it must meet an individual's sleep needs whilst also lasting for an adequate duration and being of adequate quality, which is age-dependent. The literature has suggested that athletes have increased sleep needs compared to those of the general population and thus the standard recommendations may not be sufficient for athletic populations. Therefore, a more individualised approach accounting for overall sleep health may be more appropriate for addressing sleep needs in individuals including athletes. The literature has demonstrated that adolescent athletes achieve, on average, ~6.3 h of sleep, demonstrating a discrepancy between sleep recommendations (8-10 h) and actual sleep achieved. Sleep-wake cycles undergo development during adolescence whereby adaptation occurs in sleep regulation during this phase. These adaptations increase sleep pressure tolerance and are driven by the maturation of physiological, psychological, and cognitive functioning along with delays in circadian rhythmicity, thus creating an environment for inadequate sleep during adolescence. As such, the adolescent period is a phase of rapid growth and maturation that presents multiple challenges to both sleep and nutrition; consequently, this places a significant burden on an adolescent athletes' ability to recover, thus increasing the likelihood of injury. Therefore, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on the importance of sleep and nutrition interactions in injury risk in adolescent athletes. Furthermore, it provides foundations for informing further investigations exploring the relation of sleep and nutrition interactions to recovery during adolescence."

Indeed, that insufficient sleep adversely impacts dietary intakes is well documented. On the other hand, diet may influence sleep via melatonin and its biosynthesis from tryptophan. Experimental data exist indicating that provision of specific foods rich in tryptophan or melatonin can improve sleep quality. Whole diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and other sources of dietary tryptophan and melatonin have been shown to predict favorable sleep outcomes. Although clinical trials are needed to confirm a causal impact of dietary patterns on sleep and elucidate underlying mechanisms, available data illustrate a cyclical relation between these lifestyle factors. We recommend adopting a healthful diet to improve sleep, which may further promote sustained favorable dietary practices."

Physical activity (PA) shows promise for improving sleep; however, populations with clinical sleep disturbances have been a research focus. It remains unclear whether low-impact daily PA, like walking, can affect sleep in healthy adults. The current study was embedded within a 4-week randomized controlled trial to increase PA. Participants from the greater Boston area were recruited to participate in a 4-week walking intervention on a rolling basis between October 2015 and August 2016. Fifty-nine participants (72% female) were enrolled in the study, with an average age of 49.43 (±8.40) years. The 4-week intervention was aimed at increasing participants' daily steps as the primary outcome. The current, supplementary study examined relationships between monthly and daily PA and sleep. Steps and active minutes were measured daily using a Fitbit Zip. Self-reports of sleep quality and duration were assessed daily, along with before and after the intervention. Averaged across the month, daily active minutes were positively related to sleep quality but not duration. Sex moderated this relationship; women who took more steps and were more active reported sleeping better than those less active. Within persons, on days that participants were more active than average, they reported better sleep quality and duration in both sexes. Results suggest that low-impact PA is positively related to sleep, more so in women than men. Findings also showed that PA plays a greater role in predicting sleep quality than duration."

Access to and use of interactive electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, portable gaming devices) and social media have become deep-rooted elements of adolescents' lives and are associated with poor sleep. Additionally, there is evidence of increases in poor mental health and well-being disorders in adolescents; further linked to poor sleep. This review aimed to summarise the longitudinal and experimental evidence of the impact of device use on adolescents' sleep and subsequent mental health. Nine electronic bibliographical databases were searched for this narrative systematic review in October 2022. Of 5779 identified unique records, 28 studies were selected for inclusion. A total of 26 studies examined the direct link between device use and sleep outcomes, and four reported the indirect link between device use and mental health, with sleep as a mediator. The methodological quality of the studies was generally poor. Results demonstrated that adverse implications of device use (i.e., overuse, problematic use, telepressure, and cyber-victimisation) impacted sleep quality and duration; however, relationships with other types of device use were unclear. A small but consistent body of evidence showed sleep mediates the relationship between device use and mental health and well-being in adolescents. Increasing our understanding of the complexities of device use, sleep, and mental health in adolescents are important contributions to the development of future interventions and guidelines to prevent or increase resilience to cyber-bullying and ensure adequate sleep."

Electronic databases PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched using an established methodology and pre-determined search terms for studies that reported the association between social media use, mental health, and sleep. The search yielded 6108 articles, of which 182 (n = 1,169,396) were eligible for the systematic review, and 98 (n = 102,683) could be included in the meta-analyses. The systematic review identified a high level of heterogeneity in the study results. Meta-analyses found small but significant positive associations between social media use, depression, and anxiety. In addition, problematic social media use was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and negatively associated with wellbeing. Geographical location, anxiety measure type, study design, age, and gender were identified as potential moderators. Associations for specific social media platforms as well as some moderator effects were not examined due to an insufficient number of studies. This study provides important evidence of an association between social media use/ problematic social media use, mental health, and sleep.

        "abstract": "Shift work is associated with insufficient sleep, which can compromise worker alertness with ultimate effects on occupational health and safety. Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. To assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and eight other databases on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022, applying no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, including controlled before-after (CBA) trials, interrupted time series, and cross-over trials. Eligible trials evaluated any of the following shift schedule components. • Permanency of shifts • Regularity of shift changes • Direction of shift rotation • Speed of rotation • Shift duration • Timing of start of shifts • Distribution of shift schedule • Time off between shifts • Split shifts • Protected sleep • Worker participation We included studies that assessed sleep quality off-shift, sleep duration off-shift, or sleepiness during shifts. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the records recovered by the search, read through the full-text articles of potentially eligible studies, and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, with specific additional domains for non-randomised and cluster-randomised studies. For all stages, we resolved any disagreements by consulting a third review author. We presented the results by study design and combined clinically homogeneous studies in meta-analyses using random-effects models. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with GRADE. We included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory setting and was not considered for drawing conclusions on intervention effects. The included studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. Forward versus backward rotation Three CBA trials (561 participants) investigated the effects of forward rotation versus backward rotation. Only one CBA trial provided sufficient data for the quantitative analysis; it provided very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation compared with backward rotation did not affect sleep quality measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ; mean difference (MD) -0.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.28 to 1.89; 62 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (MD -0.21 hours, 95% CI -3.29 to 2.88; 62 participants). However, there was also very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation reduced sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Faster versus slower rotation Two CBA trials and one non-randomised cross-over trial (341 participants) evaluated faster versus slower shift rotation. We were able to meta-analyse data from two studies. There was low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality off-shift (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.23) and very low-certainty evidence that faster shift rotation reduced sleep duration off-shift (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.01; 2 studies, 282 participants). The SMD for sleep duration translated to an MD of 0.38 hours' less sleep per day (95% CI -0.74 to -0.01). One study provided very low-certainty evidence that faster rotations decreased sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Limited shift duration (16 hours) versus unlimited shift duration Two RCTs (760 participants) evaluated 80-hour workweeks with maximum daily shift duration of 16 hours versus workweeks without any daily shift duration limits. There was low-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit increased sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78; which translated to an MD of 0.73 hours' more sleep per day, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 760 participants) and moderate-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit reduced sleepiness during shifts, measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14; which translated to an MD of 0.37 fewer points, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.17; 2 RCTs, 716 participants). Shorter versus longer shifts One RCT, one CBA trial, and one non-randomised cross-over trial (692 participants) evaluated shorter shift duration (eight to 10 hours) versus longer shift duration (two to three hours longer). There was very low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.15; which translated to an MD of 0.13 points lower on a scale of 1 to 5; 2 studies, 111 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.54; which translated to an MD of 0.26 hours' less sleep per day; 2 studies, 121 participants). The RCT and the non-randomised cross-over study found that shorter shifts reduced sleepiness during shifts, while the CBA study found no effect on sleepiness. More compressed versus more spread out shift schedules One RCT and one CBA trial (346 participants) evaluated more compressed versus more spread out shift schedules. The CBA trial provided very low-certainty evidence of no difference between the groups in sleep quality off-shift (MD 0.31 points, 95% CI -0.53 to 1.15) and sleep duration off-shift (MD 0.52 hours, 95% CI -0.52 to 1.56). Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes. There is a need for more high-quality studies (preferably RCTs) for all shift schedule interventions to draw conclusions on the effects of shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers."

        "abstract": "There is conflict between living according to our endogenous biological rhythms and our external environment, with disruptions resulting in negative consequences to health and performance. This is often documented in shift work and jet lag, but 'societal norms' (eg, typical working hours) can create profound issues for 'night owls', people whose internal biological timing predisposes them to follow an unusually late sleep-wake cycle. Night owls have also been associated with health issues, mood disturbances, poorer performance and increased mortality rates. This study used a randomized control trial design aimed to shift the late timing of night owls to an earlier time (phase advance), using non-pharmacological, practical interventions in a real-world setting. These interventions targeted light exposure (through earlier wake up/sleep times), fixed meals times, caffeine intake and exercise. Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by actigraphy and circadian phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no adverse effect on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical 'suboptimal' morning hours. Our findings propose a novel strategy for shifting clock timing towards a pattern that is more aligned to societal demands that could significantly improve elements of performance, mental health and sleep timing in the real world."

How sleep fragmentation (SF) impairs cognitive functioning, and especially cognitive fatigue (CF), remains elusive. We investigated the impact of induced SF on CF through the TloadDback task, measuring interindividual variability in working memory capacity. Sixteen participants underwent an adaptation polysomnography night and three consecutive nights, once in a SF condition induced by non-awakening auditory stimulations, once under restorative sleep (RS) condition, counterbalanced within-subject. In both conditions, participants were administered memory, vigilance, inhibition and verbal fluency testing, and for CF the TloadDback, as well as sleep questionnaires and fatigue and sleepiness visual analog scales were administered. Subjective fatigue increased and sleep architecture was altered after SF (reduced sleep efficiency, percentage of N3 and REM, number of NREM and REM phases) despite similar total sleep time. At the behavioral level, only inhibition deteriorated after SF, and CF similarly evolved in RS and SF conditions. In line with prior research, we show that SF disrupts sleep architecture and exerts a deleterious impact on subjective fatigue and inhibition. However, young healthy participants appear able to compensate for CF induced by three consecutive SF nights. Further studies should investigate SF effects in extended and/or pathological disruption settings."

'High' certainty of evidence showed that sleep interventions were associated with a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity compared with no intervention (five randomised controlled trials; n=992; standardised mean difference -0.27, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.14; small effect). Sleep interventions had no impact on the odds of developing depression ('moderate' certainty of evidence) or anxiety or anxiety symptom severity ('low' certainty of evidence). Additionally, 'low' certainty of evidence demonstrated no effect on cardiometabolic outcomes (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure), anthropometric measures (maternal weight, body mass index) or prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. 'Low' certainty of evidence from observational studies found that high-quality sleep reduces the odds of developing anxiety and reduces the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. 'Low' and 'very low' certainty of evidence from observational studies found that shorter sleep duration is associated with greater PPWR. Postpartum sleep interventions reduced the severity of depression symptoms."

With increasing reports of sleep disturbances and increasing mental health needs in adolescents, it is imperative that healthcare providers have a strong understanding of the relationship between sleep and mental health, the impact of poor sleep on the school experience, and an understanding of behavioral interventions targeting sleep practices. Recent studies have shown that the relationship between sleep and mental health is complex and multifaceted. While mental health diagnoses and symptoms can negatively influence sleep quality and quantity, so too does poor sleep increase the risk of mental health diagnoses, symptom severity, and suicide risk. Sleep likewise affects the school experience, both positively and negatively. Targeted interventions and prevention programs may be effective in treatment of sleep disturbances for adolescents. Clinicians must be aware of the above associations and their clinical implications. Patients with either mental health or sleep concerns should be screened for potential co-morbid conditions. Improving sleep hygiene practices can improve the sleep experience in adolescents, however, there remains a gap in understanding the best method to improve sleep hygiene practices in this population."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of sleep loss (sleep duration <6 h) on monitoring of performance and errors using Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO & Cochrane Central. We identified 28 studies, 11 of which were appropriate for meta-analysis. The systematic review indicated limited consensus regarding sleep loss impacts on performance monitoring, due to substantial differences in study methodology. However, participants typically demonstrated more conservative estimates of performance during sleep loss. Error-monitoring literature was more consistent, indicating an impairment in error-monitoring following sleep loss. Meta-analyses supported the findings of the systematic review. In terms of methodology, we found the performance monitoring literature is limited by an overreliance on correlational designs, which are likely confounded by response bias. The error-monitoring literature is limited by very few studies utilising behavioural measures to directly measure error-awareness. Future performance monitoring studies must employ methods which control for confounds such as bias, and error-monitoring studies must incorporate combined behavioural and ERP measures to better understand the impact of sleep loss on error-monitoring."

In France, a culture of sleeping separately has emerged, and the practice of co-sleeping has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). International recommendations tend to advise against co-sleeping and to devalue it as a practice.Material and methods : Two focus groups with co-sleepers (n=6) complemented by ten in-depth interviews were organized to identify the motivations and organization that mothers and their partners have when it comes to practicing co-sleeping with their children. A content analysis of what was said in the interviews by individuals and couples enabled us to find out more about the needs that co-sleeping responds to, as well as parents' co-sleeping practices.Results : Co-sleeping, made taboo by SIDS, responds to emotional and practical factors. The couple's life does not seem to be negatively impacted by it. The positive relationship it allows parents to have with their children is valued. Recommendations may often describe this way of sleeping as \"unsafe,\" but co-sleepers support this parenting practice, along with breastfeeding.Conclusion : The results highlight the health education importance for co-sleepers. Being educated about co-sleeping will ensure that their practice is safe and will mean that they do not isolate themselves socially to hide it because they only have partial knowledge of the SIDS safety measures."

Ninety-eight adolescents aged 11-17 (mean =14.38, standard deviation = 1.77; 50% female) participated in 7 consecutive nights of at-home sleep electroencephalography and completed a daily diary querying morning, afternoon, and evening caffeine use. Linear mixed-effects regressions examined relationships between caffeine consumption and total sleep time, sleep-onset latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and time spent in sleep stages. Impact of sleep indices on next-day caffeine use was also examined. Increased total caffeine consumption was associated was increased sleep-onset latency ( Caffeine consumption, especially afternoon and evening use, impacts several aspects of adolescent sleep health. In contrast, most sleep indicators did not affect next-day caffeine use, suggesting multiple drivers of adolescent caffeine consumption.

The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns determined a fundamental shift in the modern lifestyle and had profound effects on sleep and mental health. This paper aims to provide an overview of the relationship between sleep, mental health and COVID-19. Contrasting outcomes on sleep health have been highlighted by most reports during the pandemic in the general population. Consequently, while longer sleep durations have been reported, this change was accompanied by decreases in sleep quality and altered sleep timing. Furthermore, an increased impact of sleep deficiencies and mental health burden was generally reported in health care workers as compared with the adult general population. Although not among the most frequent symptoms during the acute or persistent phase, an increased prevalence of sleep deficiencies has been reported in patients with acute and long COVID. The importance of sleep in immune regulation is well known. Consequently, sleep deficiencies may influence multiple aspects of COVID-19, such as the risk, severity, and prognosis of the infection and even vaccine response."

Studies suggest that age, sex, weight change, and concurrent circadian misalignment may modify the effects of sleep restriction on bone metabolism. Interventional studies demonstrate alterations in bone metabolism and structure in response to circadian disruption that could underlie the increased fracture risk seen with night shift work. The effects of sleep and circadian disruption during adolescence may have lifelong skeletal consequences if they adversely impact bone modeling.

Short sleep duration is associated with risk of developing obesity in youth. Sleep restriction increases energy expenditure, but also increases hunger, appetite, and food intake, causing positive energy balance, impacting appetite-regulating hormones, and leading to increased eating late at night. Insufficient sleep may lead to reduced physical activity and greater sedentary behaviors. In addition, short sleep duration is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. The cumulative negative consequences of insufficient sleep increase risk for type 2 diabetes. Applications to clinical care, public policy, and future research are discussed. Insufficient sleep in adolescence increases risk for type 2 diabetes directly through impact on insulin sensitivity and indirectly through increased dietary intake, sedentary activity, and weight gain."

This was a cross-sectional study which included 4787 adolescents (Mean age: 14.83±1.6y, 56.0% girls) recruited from 15 secondary schools in Hong Kong. SJLsc was defined as the absolute difference between sleep-corrected midsleep on weekdays and weekends, at which the sleep debt has been considered. It was classified into three groups: low-level (\"LSJLsc\", <1h), mid-level (\"MSJLsc\", ≥1h and <2h), and high-level of SJLsc (\"HSJLsc\", ≥2h). Adolescents' mental health, behavioral problems and daytime sleepiness were measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) analysis were applied with consideration of confounders including age, gender, puberty and sleep problems. Nearly half (46.9%) of adolescents had SJLsc for at least 1 h. Greater SJLsc was associated with more behavioral difficulties (MSJLsc: OR: 1.20, p = 0.03; HSJLsc: OR: 1.34, p = 0.02) when controlling for age, sex, puberty, chronotype, insomnia, and time in bed. There was a dose-response relationship in which higher SJLsc had an increased risk of conduct problems and hyperactivity, while only high-level SJLsc was associated with a peer relationship problem. In RCS analysis, SJLsc was associated with a higher likelihood of behavioral difficulties (p = 0.03) but not poor mental health or daytime sleepiness. Sleep-corrected social jetlag was a unique risk factor for behavioral problems in adolescents. Our findings highlighted the need for interventions to promote healthy sleep-wake patterns in school adolescents."

        "abstract": "Sleep is essential for a range of physiological and mental functions in professional athletes. There is proof that athletes may experience lower quality and quantity of sleep. While adequate sleep has been shown to have restorative effects on the immune system and endocrine system, facilitate nervous system recovery and the metabolic cost of wakefulness, and play a significant role in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity, which can affect sports recovery, injury risk reduction, and performance. Sports performance may suffer significantly from a lack of sleep, especially under maximal and long-term exercise. Due to the potential harm, these factors may do to an athlete's endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional health, sports performance is impacted by reduced sleep quality or quantity. There are several neurotransmitters associated with the sleep-wake cycle that have been discovered. They comprise cholinergic hormone, orexin, melanin, galanin, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, histamine, and serotonin. Therefore, dietary modifications that affect the neurotransmitters in the brain also may affect sleep; particularly for athletes who require more physical and psychological recovery owing to the tremendous physiological and psychological demands placed on them during training and performance. This review explores the variables that influence the quantity and quality of sleep-in populations of athletes and assesses their possible effects. In addition, several recommendations for improving sleep are presented. Even though there has been much research on variables that impact sleep, future studies may highlight the significance of these aspects for athletes."

The fundamental regulatory processes shaped by early adversity - neural, neuroendocrine, and immune - are also central to sleep. Sleep problems, in turn, lead to a similar constellation of chronic health problems that have been linked to early adversity. We bring together work from the fields of early adversity and sleep in order to suggest a model by which sleep disturbance plays a critical role in the far-reaching impacts of early adversity on health. Future research should employ more longitudinal designs and pay particular attention to the impact of developmental periods such as adolescence and midlife when maturational and environmental factors conspire to create a unique time of sleep disturbance. We also suggesting that intervening to minimize sleep disturbance may be a promising means by which to test the model, as well as potentially blunt the long-term impact of early adversity on health."

Consequently, the search of sleeping well and sufficiently aims to be happy, healthy, and being productive at work, social and family levels. Therefore, one of the fundamental pillars of health is sleeping an adequate number of hours, follow regular sleep-wake habits and identify sleep disorders. There is a wide variety of sleep disorders that may impact the patient quality of life such as obstructive sleep apnea, chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome. The need to study sleep and its disturbances made the appearance of Sleep Medicine. This is a relatively new discipline that was born in the second half of the twentieth century and aims to promote good sleep hygiene and detect and treat those sleep disorders impairing the subject quality of life. Moreover, the field has expanded to fields such as the evaluation of pediatrics, women, aging, shift work, sports, forensic aspects, and its socioeconomic impact."

However, there is a scarcity of research investigating the impact of forest environments on sleep. This study primarily investigated the physiological and psychological effects of sleep in a forest environment. It included a sample of 50 Chinese young adult students. A comparative analysis was conducted to examine the impact of sleeping in a forest environment as opposed to a controlled room setting (control). The researchers collected data on blood pressure, electroencephalography (EEG), and psychological markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure after the participants slept in a forest environment compared to when they slept in a room (control). Moreover, a notable increase in alpha- and beta-wave frequencies was detected in the forest environment. A more pronounced reduction in anxiety scores was observed in those exposed to a forest environment compared to those in the control group. The physiological and psychological data presented in this study demonstrate that engaging in forest leisure positively affects both physical and mental relaxation in young adults."

Anxiety, depression, stress, and poor sleep quality are frequently observed in mothers with Intellectual Disability Disorder child. This study assessed the impact of a 1-month yoga intervention on anxiety, depression, stress and sleep quality in mothers of children with intellectual disabilities. We selected 53 mothers of children with intellectual disabilities between the age of 30 and 50 years (mean age, 40.2 ± 7.1 years). Of these mothers, 28 received 1.5 hours of integrated yoga practice consisting of physical postures, breathing techniques, relaxation techniques and meditation every other day for 1 month. The remaining 25 mothers, who served as the control group, participated in a group discussion session twice a week for 1 month. All mothers were assessed for anxiety and depression with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline and at 1 month. Significant improvements in anxiety (-24.8%; P < .001), depression (-15.9%; P < .001), sleep quality (-25.1%; P < .05) and stress (-11.4%; P < .001) were observed after 1 month compared with baseline in the yoga group. In a similar fashion, a significant decrease in anxiety (-12.3%; P < .001), depression (-8.6%; P < .001) and sleep quality (-5.6%; P < .001) was seen in the control group as well. The between-group comparison of post-intervention scores revealed a significantly better improvement in anxiety (P <.001), depression (P < .001), perceived stress (P < .001) and sleep quality (P = .012) in the yoga group compared with the control group. Our study indicates that yoga can be used as an effective intervention to improve psychopathology and sleep quality in mothers of children with intellectual disabilities. We recommend future randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and of longer duration to study the long-term effects of yoga."

While numerous studies have documented average increases in reported mental health issues in the general population, few have measured the magnitude of changes in mental health symptoms and sleep difficulties within individuals. Here, we measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep of university students pre- and mid-pandemic. Prior to the pandemic (Fall 2019), individuals (n = 23) were recruited to participate in an eight-day, comprehensive sleep study using Fitbit® actigraphy. Participants also completed detailed mental health and sleep surveys, including depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) surveys. One year later, these individuals repeated the study during the pandemic (Fall 2020); participants completed the original surveys and sleep study, in addition to a targeted survey on mental and sleep health due to the pandemic. Self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and sleep parameters, measured by actigraphy, were compared within the same individuals pre- and mid-pandemic. Self-report survey data revealed that three-quarters of participants experienced an increase in stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. In addition, intra-individual depression and anxiety symptoms increased to clinically significant levels within individuals from pre- to mid-pandemic. Over two-thirds of participants reported sleeping less, and more than half reported that their sleep health had worsened during the pandemic. Changes in sleep disturbance were positively associated with changes in depression and anxiety, reinforcing the robust relationship between poor sleep quality and mental health. Furthermore, individuals who reported greater sleep disturbance during the pandemic experienced lower relative proportions of both REM and deep sleep. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students is multi-faceted-mental health, sleep quality, and the amount of restorative sleep are negatively affected by the pandemic environment. These compounded effects exacerbate the health consequences of the pandemic and highlight a need for increased attention to the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, particularly in vulnerable populations of young adults."

We assessed the effect of Trp supplementation on sleep quality via meta-analysis and meta-regression. The effects of daily Trp dose (<1 g and ≥1 g) were also assessed. A database search was done in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane and a total of 18 articles were collected. Extracted data from 4 articles were also analyzed using random-effect meta-analysis and meta-regression. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used in meta-analysis. Results from the study suggested that Trp supplementation can shorten wake after sleep onset (-81.03 min/g, P = 0.017; SMD, -1.08 min [95%CI, -1.89 to -0.28]). In addition, the group receiving ≥1 g Trp supplementation had a shorter wake after sleep onset than the group with Trp < 1g supplementation (Trp <1 g vs Trp ≥1 g: 56.55 vs 28.91 min; P = 0.001). However, Trp supplementation did not affect other sleep components. Trp supplementation, especially at ≥1 g can help improve sleep quality."

Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness."

The treatments for sleep disturbances include melatonin and over-the-counter medicines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine, all of which have negative side effects. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is a traditional herb and the most preferred alternate sleep solution to manage sleep complaints. Eighty adult subjects with sleep complaints were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either V. officinalis extract (VE) or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, clinical study. Primary efficacy endpoints included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep latency using wrist actigraphy (WA), as well as a number of secondary endpoints, including sleep parameters such as actual sleep time and sleep efficiency using WA, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the feeling of waking up refreshed, and a tertiary endpoint of sleep parameters using polysomnography (PSG) in a subset of 20 subjects per group. Safety parameters included physical examination, vital sign measurements, hematology, and clinical chemistry tests. Adverse events and serious adverse events were monitored throughout the study period. Seventy-two subjects (35 and 37 subjects in the placebo and VE groups, respectively) completed the study and were included in the efficacy assessments. On Days 14, 28, and 56, the PSQI Total Score in the VE group decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the placebo group. Further, the VE group showed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in sleep latency and actual sleep time on Days 3, 14, 28, and 56, and sleep efficiency on Days 14, 28, and 56, as evaluated by WA. There was a decrease (p < 0.05) in anxiety (BAI) on Days 14, 28, and 56, daytime drowsiness (ESS) on Days 28 and 56, and an increased feeling of waking up refreshed (VAS) on Days 28 and 56 compared to placebo. PSG results carried out in subset of subjects revealed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in total sleep time, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency on Day 56 in the VE group compared to the placebo group. No safety concerns were observed throughout the study. VE supplementation significantly improved various subjective and objective parameters of sleep in young subjects with mild insomnia symptoms, such as overall sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and total sleep time. We also observed decreased anxiety and daytime sleepiness, and improved feeling of being refreshed after waking up with VE supplementation. VE was found to be safe and well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Trials Registry of India: CTRI/2022/05/042818."

Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. To assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and eight other databases on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022, applying no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, including controlled before-after (CBA) trials, interrupted time series, and cross-over trials. Eligible trials evaluated any of the following shift schedule components. • Permanency of shifts • Regularity of shift changes • Direction of shift rotation • Speed of rotation • Shift duration • Timing of start of shifts • Distribution of shift schedule • Time off between shifts • Split shifts • Protected sleep • Worker participation We included studies that assessed sleep quality off-shift, sleep duration off-shift, or sleepiness during shifts. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the records recovered by the search, read through the full-text articles of potentially eligible studies, and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, with specific additional domains for non-randomised and cluster-randomised studies. For all stages, we resolved any disagreements by consulting a third review author. We presented the results by study design and combined clinically homogeneous studies in meta-analyses using random-effects models. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with GRADE. We included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory setting and was not considered for drawing conclusions on intervention effects. The included studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. Forward versus backward rotation Three CBA trials (561 participants) investigated the effects of forward rotation versus backward rotation. Only one CBA trial provided sufficient data for the quantitative analysis; it provided very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation compared with backward rotation did not affect sleep quality measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ; mean difference (MD) -0.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.28 to 1.89; 62 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (MD -0.21 hours, 95% CI -3.29 to 2.88; 62 participants). However, there was also very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation reduced sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Faster versus slower rotation Two CBA trials and one non-randomised cross-over trial (341 participants) evaluated faster versus slower shift rotation. We were able to meta-analyse data from two studies. There was low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality off-shift (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.23) and very low-certainty evidence that faster shift rotation reduced sleep duration off-shift (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.01; 2 studies, 282 participants). The SMD for sleep duration translated to an MD of 0.38 hours' less sleep per day (95% CI -0.74 to -0.01). One study provided very low-certainty evidence that faster rotations decreased sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Limited shift duration (16 hours) versus unlimited shift duration Two RCTs (760 participants) evaluated 80-hour workweeks with maximum daily shift duration of 16 hours versus workweeks without any daily shift duration limits. There was low-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit increased sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78; which translated to an MD of 0.73 hours' more sleep per day, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 760 participants) and moderate-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit reduced sleepiness during shifts, measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14; which translated to an MD of 0.37 fewer points, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.17; 2 RCTs, 716 participants). Shorter versus longer shifts One RCT, one CBA trial, and one non-randomised cross-over trial (692 participants) evaluated shorter shift duration (eight to 10 hours) versus longer shift duration (two to three hours longer). There was very low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.15; which translated to an MD of 0.13 points lower on a scale of 1 to 5; 2 studies, 111 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.54; which translated to an MD of 0.26 hours' less sleep per day; 2 studies, 121 participants). The RCT and the non-randomised cross-over study found that shorter shifts reduced sleepiness during shifts, while the CBA study found no effect on sleepiness. More compressed versus more spread out shift schedules One RCT and one CBA trial (346 participants) evaluated more compressed versus more spread out shift schedules. The CBA trial provided very low-certainty evidence of no difference between the groups in sleep quality off-shift (MD 0.31 points, 95% CI -0.53 to 1.15) and sleep duration off-shift (MD 0.52 hours, 95% CI -0.52 to 1.56). Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes. There is a need for more high-quality studies (preferably RCTs) for all shift schedule interventions to draw conclusions on the effects of shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers."

Forty women with fibromyalgia were assigned at random in a 1:1 manner to two groups: AT (n = 20) and LBT (n = 20). Two therapeutic exercise programmes, with 60-min sessions, were undertaken three times per week for 12 weeks. Sessions were carried out in groups by a trained physiotherapist. The primary outcome was pain intensity (visual analogue scale). The secondary outcomes were pressure pain threshold (algometer), quality of life (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and physical ability (6-Minute Walk Test). Patients were evaluated at baseline, 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 18 weeks (follow-up). The statistical analysis was per-protocol. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. Effect size was calculated. The mean age was 50 [standard deviation (SD) 9] years, with median body mass index of 27 [interquartile range (IQR) 25-30] kg/m The results suggest that AT is better than LBT for reducing pain intensity and improving sleep quality after 6 weeks of follow-up.

However, efficacy of 5-HTP supplementation for improving sleep quality in older adults is unclear. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of 5-HTP supplementation on sleep quality and gut microbiota composition in older adults. This is a single-blinded, 12-week parallel randomized controlled trial. Thirty older adults (66 ± 3 years) in Singapore were randomly assigned to either consume or not consume 100 mg 5-HTP daily. Every 4 weeks, sleep quality was assessed via both subjective (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index) and objective (actigraphy watch) measures. A global sleep score (GSS) was obtained from the PSQI, where a GSS>5 defines as poor sleeper while a GSS≤5 defines as good sleeper. Blood serotonin level, urine melatonin concentration, gut microbiota composition and stool short chain fatty acids (SCFA) content were assessed at week 0 and 12. This study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04078724 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04078724). 5-HTP supplementation showed an overall favorable effect on certain sleep quality components and an increase in serum serotonin concentration. In particular, at week 12, not good sleepers but poor sleepers with 5-HTP supplementation were able to significantly improve subjective GSS (ΔSL 5-HTP supplementation can improve certain sleep quality components in older adults and this benefit was more prominently observed in poor sleepers. 5-HTP was also able to improve the gut microbiota composition in poor sleepers."

We aimed to assess the relationship between sleep quality and activity level on longitudinal BPV in a cohort of community-dwelling adults (age ≥18) from 17 countries. Using Withings home measurement devices, we examined sleep quality and physical activity over one year, operationalized as mean daily step count and number of sleep interruptions, both transformed into tertiles. The primary study outcome was high BPV, defined as the top tertile of systolic blood pressure standard deviation. Our cohort comprised 29,375 individuals (mean age = 58.6 years) with 127.8±90.1 mean days of measurements. After adjusting for age, gender, country, body mass index, measurement days, mean blood pressure, and total time in bed, the odds ratio of having high BPV for those in the top tertile of sleep interruptions (poor sleep) was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.28-1.47) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.35-1.54) for those in the lowest tertile of step count (physically inactive). Combining these exposures revealed a significant excess relative risk of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04-0.35, p = 0.012), confirming their super-additive effect. Comparing individuals with the worst exposure status (lowest step count and highest sleep interruptions, n = 2,690) to those with the most optimal status (highest step count and lowest sleep interruptions, n = 3,531) yielded an odds ratio of 2.01 (95% CI, 1.80-2.25) for high BPV. Our findings demonstrate that poor sleep quality and physical inactivity are associated with increased BPV both independently and super-additively."

This study aimed to (1) describe the sleep quality of a large sample of Australians with SCI and compare the results to data from an adult control and other clinical populations; (2) examine associations between sleep quality and participant characteristics; and (3) explore the relationship between sleep and outcomes. Cross-sectional data from the Australian arm of the International Spinal Cord Injury (Aus-InSCI) survey from 1579 community-dwelling people aged >18 years with SCI were analysed. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Relationships between participant characteristics, sleep quality and other outcomes were examined with linear and logistic regression. The PSQI was completed by 1172 individuals; 68% reported poor sleep (global PSQI score >5). Subjective sleep quality in people with SCI was poor (mean PSQI = 8.5, SD 4.5) when compared to adults without SCI (PSQI = 5.00, SD 3.37) and with traumatic brain injury (PSQI = 5.54, SD 3.94). Financial hardship and problems with secondary health conditions were significantly associated with worse sleep quality (p < 0.05). Poor sleep quality was strongly associated with lower emotional wellbeing and energy, and greater problems with participation (p < 0.001). Individuals engaged in paid work reported better sleep quality (mean PSQI = 8.1, SD 4.3) than unemployed individuals (mean PSQI = 8.7, SD 4.6; p < 0.05). Following adjustment for age, pre-injury employment, injury severity and years of education, better sleep quality remained strongly associated with being employed (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.98; p = 0.003). This study demonstrated pervasive and impactful relationships between sleep quality and important SCI outcomes. Poor sleep quality was strongly associated with worse emotional wellbeing and vitality, unemployment and lower participation. Future studies should aim to determine whether treating sleep problems can improve outcomes for people living with SCI."

This study aims to investigate pathway effects of exogenous factors on mental health via sleep, and the direct effect of sleep quality on mental health in working Australians. We employ a novel method in public health studies, a quasi-experimental (instrumental variable) approach, which can address reciprocal relationships between sleep and mental health in order to estimate causal effect of sleep quality on mental health in a sample of 19,789 working Australians aged 25-64 from waves 2013, 2017, and 2021 of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey data. We find that high job demand, as a valid instrument, adversely affects sleep quality, and the changes in sleep quality ultimately affect mental health of working Australians. These findings highlight the need for policies that address employment conditions by reducing high work demand or work pressure to mitigate poor sleep quality in the Australian workforce, ultimately improving workers' sleep quality and promoting better mental health, overall health outcomes and productivity."

Self-report surveys were conducted on said physicians during both waves, with 83 and 61 responses in the first and second waves, respectively. The reported presence of insomnia was frequent (71.8%), although it decreased in the second survey. Anxiety was moderate, decreasing from 57.1% to 43.1% between measurements. Overall, depression rates decreased between the two surveys. Substance use was found to have an indirect correlation with personal and professional satisfaction.

Losing an important sense such as smell might have unfavorable consequences on the lives of COVID-19 survivors; however, these unfavorable consequences have not been sufficiently investigated. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study, 81 COVID-19 survivors (51.85% male) answered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire. COVID-19 survivors who lost their smell were more likely to have poor sleep quality, high fatigue severity, and depression symptoms compared to others who did not lose their smell. Most COVID-19 survivors who lost their smell were women and had breathing difficulties. Our knowledge of this relationship will assist in establishing more efficient treatment regimens that consider both psychological and physiological factors. Future research is needed to investigate the causality relationship between poor sleep quality, increased fatigue, and depression symptoms in COVID-19 survivors who experienced loss of the sense of smell."

This study aimed to investigate the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) and sleep quality on the prevalence of multimorbidity in older adults, thus providing a reference for reducing the risk of the prevalence of multimorbidity and improving the health of older adults. A multi-stage random sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey on 3,250 older adults aged 60 years and above in Shanxi Province, China. The chi-square test and multiple logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of SES and sleep quality with the prevalence of multimorbidity of older adults. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 30.31% in older adults aged 60 years and above in Shanxi Province, China. After adjusting for confounders, very low SES (OR = 1.440, 95% CI: 1.083-1.913) and poor sleep quality (OR = 2.445, 95% CI: 2.043-2.927) were associated with the prevalence of multimorbidity. Older adults with low SES and poor sleep quality had the highest risk of the prevalence of multimorbidity (OR = 3.139, 95% CI: 2.288-4.307). SES and sleep quality are associated with the prevalence of multimorbidity in older adults, and older adults with lower SES and poorer sleep quality are at higher risk for the prevalence of multimorbidity."

        "abstract": "This systematic review aims to find effectful healthcare strategies, with special focus on drug-free interventions and physical therapy, as part of the treatment for sleep in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Data search was conducted across seven scientific databases. This review is deposited in the Prospero International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42023452574). Seventeen RCTs from different healthcare fields complied with our inclusion criteria. Two RCTs investigated manual therapy, five RCTs therapeutic exercise, one RCT Fu's subcutaneous needling, two RCTs physical agents (one on balneotherapy and one on cryo-stimulation), two RCTs cognitive-behavioral therapy, and four RCTs pharmacological therapy and their effect on sleep quality and/or quantity in patients suffering from chronic pain. We included the four RCT's in this systematic review with the purpose to be able to compare natural interventions with allopathic ones. As allopathic interventions are more prone to have secondary negative effects than physical therapy, compare the two types of interventions could be in favor of choosing the most effective treatment with the least secondary negative effects. Additionally, two RCTs on neurofeedback and limbic neuromodulation were also included. The results of the included studies suggest that strategies such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, Fu's subcutaneous needling, balneotherapy, cryo-stimulation, neurofeedback, limbic neuromodulation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and pharmacological therapies have positive effects on patients suffering from chronic pain and sleep disturbances, especially when they suffer musculoskeletal pain. Secondary negative effects were found for the possible overuse of certain medicines such as morphine, a huge problem in the United States. Sleep deficiency is an independent risk factor for many diseases, including chronic pain syndrome and therefore more studies are needed to find non-toxic interventions for people suffering sleep disorders associated with systemic diseases and pain."

Previous evidence has demonstrated the positive associations between increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behaviour (SB) with sleep quality. The substitutional relationships between SB, light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) need to be considered when examining how a particular behaviour may impact sleep quality. No studies, to our knowledge, have explored these substitutional relationships in middle-aged adulthood. Using an isotemporal substitution approach, this study examined the associations of replacing sedentary time with physical activity on sleep quality measures in a sample of middle-aged adults in Japan. Data from 683 adults aged 40-64 living in Japan were used. The average daily time spent in SB, LPA, and MVPA was objectively assessed by accelerometers. Two self-reported sleep quality measures were obtained using questionnaires, including rest by sleep and sleep quality. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the associations of SB, LPA, and MVPA with the sleep quality measures stratified by gender. We found that each 60 min unit of SB or LPA replaced with MVPA was favourably associated with rest by sleep among women (β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.07, 0.28, p < 0.001; β = 0.18, 95% CI 0.07, 0.32, p < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant associations between SB, LPA, and MVPA with sleep measures in men across all three models. These findings indicate that higher MVPA has a positive association with sleep quality in middle-aged women."

However, there is a scarcity of research investigating the impact of forest environments on sleep. This study primarily investigated the physiological and psychological effects of sleep in a forest environment. It included a sample of 50 Chinese young adult students. A comparative analysis was conducted to examine the impact of sleeping in a forest environment as opposed to a controlled room setting (control). The researchers collected data on blood pressure, electroencephalography (EEG), and psychological markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure after the participants slept in a forest environment compared to when they slept in a room (control). Moreover, a notable increase in alpha- and beta-wave frequencies was detected in the forest environment. A more pronounced reduction in anxiety scores was observed in those exposed to a forest environment compared to those in the control group. The physiological and psychological data presented in this study demonstrate that engaging in forest leisure positively affects both physical and mental relaxation in young adults."

The relation between epilepsy, sleep, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in culturally distinct environment of Pakistan remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence and predictors of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), poor sleep quality (SQ), and to analyze their association with HRQoL in people with epilepsy (PWE). A study was conducted among PWE attending two tertiary care hospitals of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The EDS, SQ, and HRQoL were evaluated by Urdu versions of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). The study included 200 PWE and 51 healthy controls with mean (SD) ages of 33.1 ± 13.9, 32.9 ± 10.9, and a disease duration of 5.01 ± 6.17, respectively. The majority of the respondents (n = 130, 65%) had poor seizure control, and most of these (n = 88, 68%) were on combination antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. In comparison to controls, a higher number of PWE had EDS by ESS (score ≥ 11, 10% vs. 40%, p-value 0.00), and poor SQ by PSQI (score > 5, 9% vs. 71%, p-value 0.00). A multiple logistic regression analysis reveals that the factors significantly associated with EDS were: female gender; increasing age; seizure control; duration of epilepsy; and combination AED therapy. A second multiple binary logistic regression analysis suggests that factors significantly associated with poor SQ were: increasing age; female gender; poor seizure control; and combination therapy. The Hierarchical multivariate analysis suggests that poor seizure control, EDS, and poor SQ were significant predictors of low HRQoL. The findings suggest high prevalence of EDS and poor SQ in PWE in Pakistan. A significant negative association exists between sleep complaints and HRQoL. During routine clinical consultations, awareness about sleep hygiene practices must be provided to enhance HRQoL."

With increasing reports of sleep disturbances and increasing mental health needs in adolescents, it is imperative that healthcare providers have a strong understanding of the relationship between sleep and mental health, the impact of poor sleep on the school experience, and an understanding of behavioral interventions targeting sleep practices. Recent studies have shown that the relationship between sleep and mental health is complex and multifaceted. While mental health diagnoses and symptoms can negatively influence sleep quality and quantity, so too does poor sleep increase the risk of mental health diagnoses, symptom severity, and suicide risk. Sleep likewise affects the school experience, both positively and negatively. Targeted interventions and prevention programs may be effective in treatment of sleep disturbances for adolescents. Clinicians must be aware of the above associations and their clinical implications. Patients with either mental health or sleep concerns should be screened for potential co-morbid conditions. Improving sleep hygiene practices can improve the sleep experience in adolescents, however, there remains a gap in understanding the best method to improve sleep hygiene practices in this population."

Both adolescents and parents reported their daily levels of sleep quality (morning diaries) and their psychological distress (evening diaries) for 7 days. At the level of between-family differences, parents' sleep quality mediated the association between their baseline reports of romantic relationship satisfaction and daily levels of psychological distress. In addition, adolescents' sleep quality mediated the association between family-level dysfunction and their own psychological distress. After controlling for between-family associations, spikes in parents' and/or adolescents' sleep quality on specific mornings predicted corresponding drops in parents' evening reports of psychological distress on those same days. Finally, parents' and adolescents' sleep quality demonstrated significant levels of concordance across the 7 days of the daily diary. Findings underscore the dynamic and tightly related processes within the family system and the important role that sleep plays in linking them with family members' psychological distress."

This study sought to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the most recent comprehensive evidence for which nutritional supplements have the greatest therapeutic impact on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. A systematic search of the literature, utilizing several databases, including PubMed and Web of Science, was conducted on 29 April 2022. We used developed keywords and MeSH terms for the search. The study eligibility criteria included (1) a randomized control trial; (2) investigating a plant-based therapeutic or natural supplement as the intervention; (3) measuring at least one health outcome of the following: anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, or sleep health outcomes; (4) utilizing validated measurement tools to measure the outcome of interest; (5) written in the English language; (6) peer reviewed; and (7) focused on adults and elderly populations. Following the PRISMA guidelines, 76 studies were included in this review. We used the revised Risk of Bias tool (RoB2) to assess the quality of all included randomized control trials. A qualitative data synthesis was conducted. Overall, we found several valuable insights from the evidence in the literature, including evidence that demonstrates the benefits of probiotics and vitamin B complexes on anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. Implication of Key Findings: This review provides the most updated findings in the literature on the topic, including an abundance of research that was published in the past 5 years. Given the expected rise in negative mental and sleep health outcomes following the pandemic, the supplements and therapeutics identified in this study should be the target of intervention measures to increase their accessibility and affordability and allow them to be incorporated into clinical guidelines of treatment.

However, the role of sleep disturbance in this association remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association of IA with HRQOL in Chinese adolescents and to evaluate the potential mediating role of sleep disturbance. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents attending six randomly selected middle schools in Guangzhou, China. Adolescents self-reported their internet use using the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire. HRQOL and sleep disturbance were assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to assess the association between IA and HRQOL. Baron and Kenny's causal steps method was used to examine the possible mediating role of sleep disturbance. Of the 6473 adolescents included, 23.5% had maladaptive internet use (MIU) and 16.6% had pathological internet use (PIU). Compared to adolescents with adaptive internet use (AIU), those with IA had significantly lower scores across all HRQOL dimensions and summary scales. Mediation analysis revealed that sleep disturbance was a significant mediator. Specifically, sleep disturbance mediated 34.55% of the effects of MIU and 34.06% of the effects of PIU on the HRQOL total scale score , respectively. IA was associated with poorer HRQOL, indicating the needs of preventing IA in Chinese adolescents.

Yoga is a mind-body practice that has been proven to effective in improving physical and mental health. To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated Yoga intervention on mental health measures and sleep quality among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 110 HCPs, including Doctors and nursing staff, with an age range of 20 to 65 years who were recruited through a convenience sampling method and assigned to a Yoga group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 55). The Yoga group received a weekly one-hour Yoga session followed by a 30-minute self-practice three times a week at home for one month. The control group followed routine activity. Heart rate (HR), Blood Pressure, stress measures (Perceived Stress and visual analogue Scale for Stress), COVID-related anxiety, Sleep Quality, Quality of life and Preservative Thinking were assessed before and after the intervention. A significant decrease in stress measures, COVID-19-related anxiety and fear, and perseverative thinking was noticed in the Yoga group. Sleep quality and quality of life also improved significantly. The control group showed no significant change. At one month, the Yoga group showed significantly greater improvement in stress measures, COVID-19-related anxiety and fear, perseverative thinking, sleep quality and quality of life compared to the control group. Yoga practice during the public health crisis would help reduce anxiety and stress and improve sleep among HCPs. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted."

This study aimed to investigate if distress tolerance, an individual's perceived or actual 'capacity to withstand negative psychological states', helps to explain the relationship between sleep and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. College students (N = 187) completed questionnaires using an online survey platform between 6 April 2020, and 6 June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the indirect effect of distress tolerance on the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. Distress tolerance partially accounted for the relationship between sleep quality and perceived stress but did not help to explain the association between sleep quality and depression or anxiety. Two components of distress tolerance, absorption and appraisal, helped to explain the relationship between sleep quality and all mental health outcomes. These findings help explain how distress tolerance relates to mental health when sleep is negatively impacted. Prospective designs replicating these findings are needed and future research may inform how psychological interventions could target distress tolerance in the context of poor sleep, especially during major stressors."

Here we analyze the sleep of 30,082 individuals across 11 countries using 52 million activity records from wearable devices. Our data are consistent with past studies of gender and age-associated sleep characteristics. However, our analysis of wearable device data uncovers differences in recorded vs. self-reported bedtime and sleep duration. The dataset allowed us to study how country-specific metrics such as GDP and cultural indices relate to sleep in groups and individuals. Our analysis indicates that diverse sleep metrics can be represented by two dimensions: sleep quantity and quality. We find that 55% of the variation in sleep quality, and 63% in sleep quantity, are explained by societal factors. Within a societal boundary, individual sleep experience was modified by factors like exercise. Increased exercise or daily steps were associated with better sleep quality (for example, faster sleep onset and less time awake in bed), especially in countries like the U.S. and Finland. Understanding how social norms relate to sleep will help create strategies and policies that enhance the positive impacts of sleep on health, such as productivity and well-being."

Participants were designated to follow evening sleep (15:00-23:00) and morning sleep (09:00-17:00) schedules in a randomized order. Chronotype was confirmed by the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Sleep behaviors and light exposure were recorded using actigraphy. Outcome measures were sleepiness evaluated by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, sleep quality evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and attention performance assessed with psychomotor vigilance test. Differences in outcome between the morning and evening sleep schedules were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. The participants slept for longer durations during evening sleep schedules compared with morning sleep schedules. Lower sleepiness scores, higher sleep quality, and shorter reaction times and less lapse numbers in the psychomotor vigilance test were observed for participants during evening sleep schedules than morning sleep schedules after adjustment for light exposure and sleep duration. Significant interaction effects were observed for reaction time and lapse number between chronotype and sleep schedule, where the differences between sleep schedules were most prominent among those with late chronotypes. It is recommended that night shift workers with shift work disorder arrange to sleep in the evening instead of the morning for better sleep and attention performance, especially those with late chronotypes.

The impact of these symptoms on IVF outcome is however debated. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether sleep quality and psychological health can affect the chances of success of the procedure. Women undergoing IVF were recruited at the time of oocytes retrieval. Women's sleep quality and psychological health was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Baseline characteristics and results of the three scales were compared between women who did and did not succeed. Overall, 263 women were included, of whom 81 had a clinical pregnancy (31%). As expected, successful women were younger, and their ovarian reserve was more preserved. FPI and HADS scores did not differ. Conversely, a statistically significant difference emerged for the PSQI score, the median [interquartile range] in pregnant and non-pregnant women being 4 [3-5] and 5 [3-7], respectively (p = 0.004). The crude and adjusted OR of pregnancy in women with a PSQI > 5 (indicating impaired sleep quality) was 0.46 (95% CI 0.25-0.86, p = 0.02) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.26-0.94, p = 0.03), respectively.

Existing studies suggest that physical exercise is essential to alleviate negative feelings, yet the intrinsic mechanisms by which it affects negative emotions have not been fully revealed. Negative emotions in college students represent a significant issue affecting mental health. This study investigates the relationship between physical exercise and negative emotions among college students, incorporating sleep quality and self-rated health (SRH) as mediators to analyze the pathway mechanism of how physical exercise affects students' negative emotions. A cross-sectional study design was utilized, employing online questionnaires for investigation. The scales included the Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), resulting in the collection of 30,475 valid questionnaires, with a validity rate of 91%. Chain mediation tests and Bootstrap methods were applied for effect analysis. The proportions of university students engaged in low, medium, and high levels of physical exercise were 77.6, 13.1, and 9.3%, respectively. The proportions of students experiencing \"very severe\" levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were 4.5, 10.9, and 3.6%, respectively. Physical exercise was significantly positively correlated with self-rated health ( College students primarily engage in low-intensity physical activity. Sleep quality and self-rated health mediate the impact of physical exercise on students' negative emotions. A certain level of physical activity can directly affect students' emotional states and indirectly influence their negative emotions via sleep and self-rated health. Regular engagement in physical activities primarily positively impacts emotional states by enhancing mood stability and overall emotional resilience."

The degree of its impact, however, is different from place-to-place and person-to-person. Although there is a growing literature on the variable impact of the pandemic on the quality of sleep, loneliness, and mood across different populations (e.g., students, health-workers), little is known about how COVID-19-specific anxiety affects the loneliness feeling and sleep quality among students and employees, specifically, in a low-resource region like Bangladesh. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-related anxiety on the feeling of loneliness and sleep quality of students and professionals in Bangladesh. Additionally, we were interested in comparing the level of COVID-specific anxiety, loneliness, and quality of sleep between these two groups. In total, 211 Bangladeshi students and professionals participated in an online survey in August 2021 when the restriction was still in place. Measures of COVID-19 anxiety, loneliness, and sleep quality scales were used. Regression analysis indicated that overall loneliness and poor sleep quality were strongly predicted by COVID-specific anxiety regardless of being a student or professional. Almost half of the study population (48.3 %) felt severe loneliness and 70.01 % were bad sleepers. Mann-Whitney U test revealed that professionals felt more emotionally lonely, had a higher level of COVID-19-specific anxiety, and had poorer sleep quality than students. A better support structure should be implemented to help the population, particularly, the professionals to lessen their COVID-19-related anxiety and loneliness, and promote better sleep for alleviating stress and improved well-being."

Possible sleep bruxism was determined by the question: \"Has anyone told you that you grind your teeth in your sleep?\" Sleep quality was determined by answering the following question: \"How would you classify the quality of your sleep?\". The outcome was created by combining occurrence of sleep bruxism and poor sleep quality. The Sense of Coherence (SOC) was assessed using the SOC-13 scale. Bullying was investigated using the victim scale of the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire and oral health-related verbal bullying using an item from the Child Perceptions Questionnaire-11-14. Demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and clinical data were also collected. Poisson regression models with robust variance were used. Results were expressed as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 429 adolescents with a mean age of 12.6 (standard deviation 1.3) years were evaluated. The prevalence of bruxism associated with poor sleep quality was 23.7%. Victims of school bullying (PR 2.06; 95%CI: 1.01-4.22) and oral health-related verbal bullying (PR 1.87; 95%CI: 1.18-2.95) presented higher prevalence of bruxism associated with poor sleep quality. Factors such as skin color and SOC were also associated with the outcome. These findings suggest an association between episodes of bullying and bruxism related to poor sleep quality."

        "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based, antioxidant-rich, unsaturated fat dietary pattern that has been consistently associated with lower rates of noncommunicable diseases and total mortality, so that it is considered one of the healthiest dietary patterns. Clinical trials and mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet and its peculiar foods and nutrients exert beneficial effects against inflammation, oxidative stress, dysmetabolism, vascular dysfunction, adiposity, senescence, cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and tumorigenesis, thus preventing age-associated chronic diseases and improving wellbeing and health. Nocturnal sleep is an essential physiological function, whose alteration is associated with health outcomes and chronic diseases. Scientific evidence suggests that diet and sleep are related in a bidirectional relationship, and the understanding of this association is important given their role in disease prevention. In this review, we surveyed the literature concerning the current state of evidence from epidemiological studies on the impact of the Mediterranean diet on nighttime sleep quantity and quality. The available studies indicate that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with adequate sleep duration and with several indicators of better sleep quality. Potential mechanisms mediating the effect of the Mediterranean diet and its foods and nutrients on sleep are described, and gap-in-knowledge and new research agenda to corroborate findings are discussed."

        "abstract": "Sleep serves important biological functions, and influences health and longevity through endocrine and metabolic related systems. Sleep debt, circadian misalignment and sleep disruption from obstructive sleep apnea is widespread in modern society and accumulates with life because recovery sleep is not completely restorative. Accumulated disordered sleep throughout life impacts the ageing process and the development of age-related diseases. When epidemiological and interventional studies are considered collectively, sleep loss and lower sleep duration are associated with lower morning, afternoon and 24-h testosterone; as well as higher afternoon, but not morning or 24-h cortisol. These reciprocal changes imbalances anabolic-catabolic signaling because testosterone and cortisol are respectively the main anabolic and catabolic signals in man. Fixing testosterone-cortisol balance by means of a novel dual-hormone clamp mitigates the induction of insulin resistance by sleep restriction and provided the first proof-of-concept that the metabolic harm from sleep loss can be ameliorated by approaches that do not require sleeping more. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with lower testosterone, even after controlling for age and obesity whereas the conclusion that continuous positive airway pressure therapy has no effect on testosterone is premature because available studies are underpowered and better-quality studies suggest otherwise. High dose testosterone therapy induces OSA, but more physiological dosing may not; and this effect may be transient or may dissipate with longer term therapy. Studies investigating the origin of the diurnal testosterone rhythm, the effect of circadian misalignment on testosterone-cortisol balance, and methods to mitigate metabolic harm, are required."

To evaluate the association of longitudinal sleep patterns with age-related changes in cognitive function in healthy older adults. This cross-sectional study is a retrospective longitudinal analyses of the Seattle Longitudinal Study (SLS), which evaluated self-reported sleep duration (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in older adults. Participants within the SLS were enrolled as part of a community-based cohort from the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound and Health Maintenance Organization of Washington between 1956 and 2020. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to May 2023. The main outcome for this study was cognitive impairment, as defined by subthreshold performance on both the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Sleep duration was defined by self-report of median nightly sleep duration over the last week and was assessed longitudinally over multiple time points. Median sleep duration, sleep phenotype (short sleep, median ≤7 hours; medium sleep, median = 7 hour; long sleep, median ≥7 hours), change in sleep duration (slope), and variability in sleep duration (SD of median sleep duration, or sleep variability) were evaluated. Of the participants enrolled in SLS, only 1104 participants who were administered both the Health Behavior Questionnaire and the neuropsychologic battery were included for analysis in this study. A total of 826 individuals (mean [SD] age, 76.3 [11.8] years; 468 women [56.7%]; 217 apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriers [26.3%]) had complete demographic information and were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model (concordance, 0.76) showed that status as a short sleeper (hazard ratio, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.59-8.50) and higher sleep variability (hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.14-5.49) were significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. In this community-based longitudinal study of the association between sleep patterns and cognitive performance, the short sleep phenotype was significantly associated with impaired cognitive performance. Furthermore, high sleep variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment, highlighting the possibility that instability in sleep duration over long periods of time may impact cognitive decline in older adults."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of day-to-day deviations in sleep parameters with biological ages among 6052 adults participating in the 2011-2014 waves of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sleep parameters, including sleep duration, efficiency, midpoint, and day-to-day deviations in sleep parameters, including standard deviation of sleep duration (sleep variability), standard deviation of sleep midpoint (sleep irregularity), catch-up sleep, and social jetlag, were obtained from 4 to 7 days of 24-h accelerometer recording. We used physiological data to compute measurements of biological aging according to 3 published algorithms: PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal method Biological Age, and homeostatic dysregulation. After adjustment of multiple covariates, we observed that all parameters of day-to-day deviations in sleep were significantly associated with biological aging with larger sleep variability, larger sleep irregularity, more catch-up sleep, and more social jetlag linked with more advanced biological aging. The significant associations of sleep irregularity, catch-up sleep, and social jetlag with biological aging indices remained even after adjustment for sleep duration, efficiency, and midpoint. In this study, we found that day-to-day deviations in sleep parameters are independently associated with biological aging in US general population. Since day-to-day deviation in sleep is a modifiable behavioral factor, our finding suggests that intervention aiming at increasing regularity in sleep patterns may be a novel approach for extending a healthy life span."

To examine the independent association of sedentary behaviors and LPA with healthy aging, and to estimate the theoretical association of replacing sedentary behavior with LPA, MVPA, or sleep with healthy aging. In this cohort study using data from the Nurses' Health Study, participants aged 50 years or older and free of major chronic diseases in 1992 were prospectively followed up for 20 years. Data were analyzed from January to May 2022. Three measures for sedentary behaviors (hours watching television, sitting at work, and other sitting at home) and 2 measures for LPA (hours of standing or walking around at home [LPA-Home] and at work [LPA-Work]). Healthy aging was defined as survival to at least age 70 years with maintenance of 4 health domains (ie, no major chronic diseases and no impairment in subjective memory, physical function, or mental health). The isotemporal substitution model was used to evaluate the potential impact on healthy aging of replacing 1 hour of 1 behavior with equivalent duration of another. Among 45 176 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [6.0] years), 3873 (8.6%) women achieved healthy aging. After adjustment for covariates including MVPA, each increment of 2 hours per day in sitting watching television was associated with a 12% (95% CI, 7%-17%) reduction in the odds of healthy aging. In contrast, each increase of 2 hours per day in LPA-Work was associated with a 6% (95% CI, 3%-9%) increase in the odds of healthy aging. Replacing 1 hour of sitting watching television with LPA-Home (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12), LPA-Work (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.14), or MVPA (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23-1.34) was associated with increased odds of healthy aging. Among participants who slept 7 hours per day or less, replacing television time with sleep was also associated with increased odds of healthy aging. In this cohort study, longer television watching time decreased odds of healthy aging, whereas LPA and MVPA increased odds of healthy aging and replacing sitting watching television with LPA or MVPA, or with sleep in those who slept 7 hours per day or less, was associated with increased odds of healthy aging, providing evidence for rearranging 24-hour behavior to promote overall health."

Rates of major depressive episode in the last year increased 52% 2005-2017 (from 8.7% to 13.2%) among adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 63% 2009-2017 (from 8.1% to 13.2%) among young adults 18-25. Serious psychological distress in the last month and suicide-related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and deaths by suicide) in the last year also increased among young adults 18-25 from 2008-2017 (with a 71% increase in serious psychological distress), with less consistent and weaker increases among adults ages 26 and over. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses separating the effects of age, period, and birth cohort suggest the trends among adults are primarily due to cohort, with a steady rise in mood disorder and suicide-related outcomes between cohorts born from the early 1980s (Millennials) to the late 1990s (iGen). Cultural trends contributing to an increase in mood disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors since the mid-2000s, including the rise of electronic communication and digital media and declines in sleep duration, may have had a larger impact on younger people, creating a cohort effect.

However, distinct ages may exhibit unequal sleep needs. Few studies have addressed the modulation of age on SD associated all-cause mortality (AM). This study aimed to investigate age- and gender-specific associations between SD and AM. Four national cohort studies were conducted: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Data pre-processing such as integration, weighting and interpolation was conducted following cohort-specific user manuals. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to test the nonlinear relationship. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analysis were used to evaluate the association between SD and AM. The moderation of mortality by SD was subsequently investigated in adult, middle-age, elderly and longevity. RCS analysis showed a nonlinear correlation between SD and AM in the four cohorts(P < 0.001). Survival analysis reveals 6-8 h to be the optimal SD. Subgroup analyses showed a higher risk in adults with ≤5 h than ≥9 h (HR: 2.95 [1.90-4.59] vs 1.83 [1.08-3.12]), and a similar risk in middle age (HR: 2.42 [1.76-3.32] vs 2.44 [1.64-3.61]). In contrast, four datasets suggest a higher risk of the elderly being affected by long SD. Adults (HR = 1.82 [1.14-2.92], P = 0.012) and middle age (NHANES: HR = 1.50 [1.04-2.16], P = 0.029; SHARE: HR = 3.04 [1.10-8.41], P = 0.032) significantly increased the risk of short sleep compared to elderly. SD associated mortality risk varies with age. Young adults should avoid poor sleep, while elderly should avoid sleeping too much."

Studies suggest that age, sex, weight change, and concurrent circadian misalignment may modify the effects of sleep restriction on bone metabolism. Interventional studies demonstrate alterations in bone metabolism and structure in response to circadian disruption that could underlie the increased fracture risk seen with night shift work. The effects of sleep and circadian disruption during adolescence may have lifelong skeletal consequences if they adversely impact bone modeling. Data suggest that short sleep and night shift work negatively impact bone metabolism and health. Rigorous studies of prevalent sleep and circadian disruptions are needed to determine mechanisms and develop prevention strategies to optimize lifelong skeletal health."

Self-reported typical sleep characteristics and shift work were not associated with PDAC risk. Considering the role of light at night and shift work in circadian disruption and cancer risk, it is plausible that poor sleep health among a general population may be related to cancer risk through similar sleep and circadian disrupting processes.

This has had widespread impact on views on the optimal sleep duration. However, age, being employed/retired, and blue-/white-collar status, may influence the time available for sleep and thus, confound the association. We investigated the role of these factors on the association between sleep duration and mortality. We used employed and retired participants (N = 25,430) from the Swedish National March Cohort and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the shape of the association. We found a significant U-shaped association in a multivariable model with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10, 1.39) for <5-hr sleep duration, and a HR of 1.30 (95% CI 1.12, 1.51) for ≥9-hr sleep duration, with the lowest HR for 7 hr, but with a span of low HRs from 5 to 8 hr. Unadjusted values showed a pronounced U-shape. Adjusting for age accounted for most of the attenuation in the multivariable model. Stratification into five age groups showed a significant U-shape only in those aged >60.3 years at baseline. The shape of the association did not differ between blue-/white-collar workers, nor between employed and retired groups. We conclude that the U-shaped association between sleep duration and mortality is present only in older individuals."

        "abstract": "The duration of sleep plays a crucial role in the development of physiological functions that impact health. However, little is known about the associations between sleep duration and functional disability among older adults in China. This study aimed to explore the associations between sleep duration and functional disabilities in the older population (aged≥65 years) in China. The data for this cross-sectional study were gathered from respondents 65 years and older who participated in the 2018 survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, an ongoing nationwide longitudinal investigation of Chinese adults. The duration of sleep per night was obtained through face-to-face interviews. Functional disability was assessed according to activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales. The association between sleep duration and functional disability was assessed by multivariable generalized linear models. A restricted cubic-spline model was used to explore the dose-response relationship between sleep duration and functional disability. In total, 5519 participants (n=2471, 44.77% men) were included in this study with a mean age of 73.67 years, including 2800 (50.73%) respondents with a functional disability, 1978 (35.83%) with ADL disability, and 2299 (41.66%) with IADL disability. After adjusting for potential confounders, the older adults reporting shorter (≤4, 5, or 6 hours) or longer (8, 9, or ≥10 hours) sleep durations per night exhibited a notably increased risk of functional disability compared to that of respondents who reported having 7 hours of sleep per night (all P<.05), which revealed a U-shaped association between sleep duration and dysfunction. When the sleep duration fell below 7 hours, increased sleep duration was associated with a significantly lower risk of functional disability (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91; P<.001). When the sleep duration exceeded 7 hours, the risk of functional disability associated with a prolonged sleep duration increased (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29; P<.001). Sleep durations shorter and longer than 7 hours were associated with a higher risk of functional disability among Chinese adults 65 years and older. Future studies are needed to explore intervention strategies for improving sleep duration with a particular focus on functional disability."

Using Medical Subject Headings keywords, we searched Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, the American Psychological Association PsycArticles, and PsychInfo databases to evaluate the association between ACEs and sleep disturbances. ACEs increase the odds of developing chronic short sleep duration, that is, <6 hours of sleep per night compared with optimal sleep duration of 7-9 hours per night during adulthood. The ACEs are positively associated with poor sleep characteristics such as short sleep duration and long-term sleep problems. Clinicians should pay close attention to developmental trauma care, access community health programs, and help develop better coping skills, resiliency, and good sleep habits in their patients."

We demonstrate the socio-ecologial impact of sleep health with findings on gender and couples' relationships as exemplars. Robust gender differences in sleep duration and insomnia are due to biological and socio-ecological factors. Gender differences in insufficient sleep vary by country of origin and age whereas gender differences in insomnia reflect minoritized identities (e.g., sexual, gender). Co-sleeping with a partner is associated with longer sleep and more awakenings. Gender differences and couples' sleep were affected by intersecting social and societal influences, which supports a socio-ecological approach to sleep. Recent and seminal contributions to sleep health highlight the importance of observing individual sleep outcomes in a socio-ecological context. Novel methodology, such as global measures of sleep health, can inform efforts to improve sleep and, ultimately, public health."

We assessed for associations between sleep duration and chronotype on cardiac structure and function. UK Biobank participants with CMR data and without known cardiovascular disease were included. Self-reported sleep duration was categorized as short (<7 h/d), normal (7-9 h/d) and long (>9 h/d). Self-reported chronotype was categories as \"definitely morning\" or \"definitely evening.\" Analysis included 3903 middle-aged adults: 929 short, 2924 normal and 50 long sleepers; with 966 definitely-morning and 355 definitely-evening chronotypes. Long sleep was independently associated with lower left ventricular (LV) mass (-4.8%, P = 0.035), left atrial maximum volume (-8.1%, P = 0.041) and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-4.8%, P = 0.038) compared to those with normal sleep duration. Evening chronotype was independently associated with lower LV end-diastolic volume (-2.4%, P = 0.021), RV end-diastolic volume (-3.6%, P = 0.0006), RV end systolic volume (-5.1%, P = 0.0009), RV stroke volume (RVSV -2.7%, P = 0.033), right atrial maximal volume (-4.3%, P = 0.011) and emptying fraction (+1.3%, P = 0.047) compared to morning chronotype. Sex interactions existed for sleep duration and chronotype and age interaction for chronotype even after considering potential confounders. In conclusion, longer sleep duration was independently associated with smaller LV mass, left atrial volume and RV volume. Evening chronotype was independently associated with smaller LV and RV and reduced RV function compared to morning chronotype. Sex interactions exist with cardiac remodeling most evident in males with long sleep duration and evening chronotype. Recommendations for sleep chronotype and duration may need to be individualized based on sex."

We examined sleep and cognitive data from the UK Biobank (N = 479,420) in middle-to-late life healthy individuals (age 38-73 years) and the relationship with brain structure in a sub-group (N = 37,553). Seven hours of sleep per day was associated with the highest cognitive performance which decreased for every hour below and above this sleep duration. This quadratic relationship remained present in older individuals (>60 years, N = 212,006). Individuals who sleep between six-to-eight hours had significantly greater grey matter volume in 46 of 139 different brain regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampi, precentral gyrus, right frontal pole and cerebellar subfields. Several brain regions showed a quadratic relationship between sleep duration and volume while other regions were smaller only in individuals who slept longer. These findings highlight the important relationship between the modifiable lifestyle factor of sleep duration and cognition as well as a widespread association between sleep and structural brain health."

        "abstract": "Short sleep duration over a prolonged period in childhood could have a detrimental impact on long-term mental health, including the development of psychosis. Further, potential underlying mechanisms of these associations remain unknown. To examine the association between persistent shorter nighttime sleep duration throughout childhood with psychotic experiences (PEs) and/or psychotic disorder (PD) at age 24 years and whether inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) potentially mediate any association. This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Data analysis was conducted from January 30 to August 1, 2023. Nighttime sleep duration was collected at 6, 18, and 30 months and at 3.5, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, and 6 to 7 years. PEs and PD were assessed at age 24 years from the Psychosislike Symptoms Interview. CRP level at ages 9 and 15 years and IL-6 level at 9 years were used as mediators. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) were applied to detect trajectories of nighttime sleep duration, and logistic regressions were applied for the longitudinal associations between trajectories of nighttime sleep duration and psychotic outcomes at 24 years. Path analyses were applied to test CRP and IL-6 as potential mediators. Data were available on 12 394 children (6254 female [50.5%]) for the LCGA and on 3962 young adults (2429 female [61.3%]) for the logistic regression and path analyses. The LCGA identified a group of individuals with persistent shorter nighttime sleep duration across childhood. These individuals were more likely to develop PD (odds ratio [OR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.51-4.15; P < .001) and PEs (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.23-5.95; P < .001) at age 24 years. Increased levels of IL-6 at 9 years, but not CRP at 9 or 15 years, partially mediated the associations between persistent shorter sleep duration and PD (bias-corrected estimate = 0.003; 95% CI, 0.002-0.005; P = .007) and PEs (bias-corrected estimate = 0.002; 95% CI, 0-0.003; P = .03) in young adulthood. Findings of this cohort study highlight the necessity of addressing short sleep duration in children, as persistence of this sleep problem was associated with subsequent psychosis. This study also provides preliminary evidence for future targeted interventions in children addressing both sleep and inflammatory responses."

We conducted a large-scale cross-sectional population-based survey study of Hong Kong children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. A representative sample of students were interviewed to assess their HRQoL using PedsQL and EQ-5D-Y-5L. Multivariable homoscedastic Tobit regression with linear form or restricted cubic spline of predictors was used to analyze the associations between screen time, sleep duration, and HRQoL. Multiple imputation by chained equations was performed to deal with missing data. A total of 7555 respondents (mean age 11.5, SD 3.2; 55.1% female) were sampled. Their EQ VAS scores, PedsQL physical summary scores, and psychosocial summary scores were positively correlated with sleep duration and moderate/vigorous activity but was negatively correlated with screen time. Children and adolescents who had longer exposure to screen, shorter sleep duration, and lower physical activity levels appeared to have poorer HRQoL as assessed by PedsQL and EQ-5D-Y-5L. Advice and guidance on screen time allocation for children and adolescents should be provided at the levels of school, community, and family."

A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINHAL to identify studies with at least one sleep measure and a psychological health outcome. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated by associations between individual components of sleep and psychological health (eg, sleep quality-depression). Reviewed studies (n = 32) included 14,648 participants and yielded 219 ES. ES for anxiety/stress were combined due to insufficient data to analyze individually. Average strengths of associations for sleep duration-depression (ES = .52) and sleep duration-anxiety/stress (ES = .48), sleep quality-depression (ES = .55) and sleep quality-anxiety/stress (ES = .58), and insomnia-depression (ES = .67) ranged from medium to large. Marital status, parity, BMI, and meeting sleep recommendations moderated sleep duration-depression and sleep duration-anxiety/stress. SES, gestational age/trimester, parity, and BMI moderated sleep quality-depression and sleep quality-anxiety/stress associations. Poor sleep quality and depression are prevalent during pregnancy and may negatively impact maternal and fetal outcomes. Moderating effects suggest that pregnant women of different BMI status and gestational age differ in their sleep habits and depression and anxiety/stress levels. Findings highlight the need to better understand the impact of these associations on maternal-fetal outcomes to inform interventions to improve sleep and psychological health."

Studies included children with a mean age between 1 and 18 years old that either described factors affecting the sleep of children who are hospitalized on a non-intensive care unit or reported on sleep-related intervention outcomes. We conducted separate narrative reviews for each of the two aims and then synthesized findings from quantitative and qualitative studies across both aims. Forty-five articles were included for review. Despite most sleep disturbances being attributed to environmental disruptions (e.g. noise, staff interruptions), most interventions targeted the child level using relaxation techniques. Although the majority of interventions were small pilot studies, preliminary findings appear to positively impact sleep duration. The Pediatric Inpatient Sleep Model was proposed to illustrate connections between sleep disturbances, factors influencing sleep, and existing intervention components. Replication studies are needed, including larger-scale sleep promotion interventions among hospitalized children. Given the identification of environmental factors as the main cause of night wakings, environmental modifications are crucial. Additional research examining contributors to intraindividual variability in disrupted sleep patterns during hospitalizations as well as the consequences of these disturbances is warranted."

Adolescents (baseline age 13.6±0.4 years) were recruited from schools in western Sweden (during the COVID-19 outbreak schools were kept open for those under 16 years of age). The COVID-19 pandemic reached Sweden on 31 January 2020. A total of 1316 adolescents answered the 2-year follow-up survey before (unexposed to COVID-19 pandemic, controls) and 584 after 1 February 2020 (COVID19-exposed). Data on stress, psychosomatic symptoms, happiness, relationships with parents and peers, school and health behaviours were collected. Adolescents reported higher levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms and lower levels of happiness at follow-up compared to baseline. These changes occurred to a similar extent in both the control and COVID-19-exposed groups. Likewise, the COVID-19-exposed group showed no deterioration in peer relations or relations with parents versus controls. We did not find any significant differences between groups regarding sleep duration and physical activity."

The primary outcomes included all mental health problems in AR patients. Subgroup analyses based on outcome and AR severity, country, AR diagnosis, recruitment setting, and age were performed. Secondary outcomes included the risk of these problems compared to controls (healthy or without AR). In AR, depression (25%), anxiety (25%), stress (65%), distress (57%), suicidal thoughts (14%) and attempts (4%), poor sleep quality (48%), insomnia (36%), sleep impairment (33%), and insufficient sleep duration <7 h (59%) were prevalent. The severity of these outcomes differed significantly. Patients' country, AR diagnostic method, recruitment method/setting, and age group were significant effect modifiers. Compared to controls, AR resulted in significantly higher risk of depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal attempts and thoughts, insomnia, and sleep impairment. AR patients had significantly lower sleep duration. Mental health problems are very common among AR patients, further exacerbating their sleep quality and duration and intention to suicide."

Cox models were used to estimate the risk of dementia associated with baseline sleep parameters (sleep duration, time in bed (TIB), sleep timing, sleepiness and insomnia). Latent-process mixed models were performed to compare sleep trajectories according to the case-control status. long baseline nighttime and 24-h sleep durations (≥9 h) as well as being persistent or becoming long sleepers during follow-up were associated with dementia incidence. Trajectories of sleep durations and TIB showed faster increases in cases compared with controls up to 12 years before dementia. The mean differences [95%CI] for 24-h sleep duration between cases and controls were: 0.27 h [0.01;0.52], 0.34 [0.09;0.58] and 0.67 [0.44;0.90] at -12, -8 and -2 years, respectively. Bedtime trajectories showed an earlier bedtime in cases up to -8 years. long sleep duration and earlier bedtime may impact dementia incidence."

Here we analyze the sleep of 30,082 individuals across 11 countries using 52 million activity records from wearable devices. Our data are consistent with past studies of gender and age-associated sleep characteristics. However, our analysis of wearable device data uncovers differences in recorded vs. self-reported bedtime and sleep duration. The dataset allowed us to study how country-specific metrics such as GDP and cultural indices relate to sleep in groups and individuals. Our analysis indicates that diverse sleep metrics can be represented by two dimensions: sleep quantity and quality. We find that 55% of the variation in sleep quality, and 63% in sleep quantity, are explained by societal factors. Within a societal boundary, individual sleep experience was modified by factors like exercise. Increased exercise or daily steps were associated with better sleep quality (for example, faster sleep onset and less time awake in bed), especially in countries like the U.S. and Finland. Understanding how social norms relate to sleep will help create strategies and policies that enhance the positive impacts of sleep on health, such as productivity and well-being."

Adolescents ages 14-18 years with T1D completed questionnaires evaluating FOH (Child Hypoglycemia Fear Survey) and sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI). Analyses included linear and logistic regression, t-tests and Fisher's exact tests. Participants included 95 adolescents (52 female) with a median (IQR) age of 16.5 (15.3-17.7) years and a T1D duration of 5.7 (2.5-9.6) years. Analyses showed increased FOH-Worry subscale scores were associated with reduced sleep duration (β = -0.03, p = 0.042, adjusting for BMI z-score, race and ethnicity) and increased sleep disturbances (OR = 1.1, p = 0.038, adjusting for race and ethnicity). Frequent CGM users had longer sleep duration (average 7.5 h) compared with infrequent or non-CGM users (average = 6.8 h; p = 0.029), and pump users had overall improved sleep health as determined by PSQI score (p = 0.019). Technology use did not have significant interactions in the relationships between FOH and sleep duration or sleep disturbances. Worrying about hypoglycaemia was associated with impaired sleep for adolescents with T1D. Diabetes technology users have some sleep improvements, but CGM and pump use do little to alter the relationship between FOH and sleep outcomes."

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library on 08/12/2022 for studies reporting sleep in relation to myopia among children and adolescents. Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent refraction < -0.5 diopter. The primary outcome was the relationship between sleep duration and myopia prevalence. Secondary outcomes include the effect of sleep quality, bedtime, and waketime on myopia prevalence, incidence, and progression. Odds ratio (OR) was estimated with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Eighteen studies (49,277 participants) were included in the review, and six studies (14,116 participants) were included in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome. There was no significant correlation between sleep and myopia prevalence (OR = 0.905, 95% CI = 0.782 to 1.047). Some studies suggested that better sleep quality (2 of 6 studies), earlier bedtime (3 of 5 studies), and later waketimes (2 of 3 studies) had protective effects on myopia. Sleep duration did not affect myopia prevalence in children, while other aspects of sleep had plausible but inconclusive impacts on myopia development and progression.

The study included 9981 participants 6 years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, who had 4-7 days of valid 24-h accelerometer recording with at least one day obtained during weekend (Friday or Saturday night). Of the study participants, 43% showed ≥ 60 min sleep duration standard deviation (SD), 51% experienced ≥ 60 min catch-up sleep, 20% showed ≥ 60 min sleep midpoint SD, and 43% experienced ≥ 60 min social jetlag. American youth and young adults averaged greater sleep variability compared to other age groups. Non-Hispanic Blacks showed greater sleep variability in all parameters compared to other racial groups. There was a main effect of sex on sleep midpoint SD and social jetlag with males averaging slightly more than females. Our study provides important observations on sleep variability parameters of residents of the United States by using objectively measured sleep patterns and will provide unique insights for personalized advice on sleep hygiene."

This study tested the hypothesis that more pro-inflammatory diets during pregnancy are associated with a decrease in sleep quality and shorter sleep duration. The Health in Pregnancy and Postpartum study promoted a healthy lifestyle in pregnant women with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity (n = 207). Data from <16 weeks and 32 weeks gestation were used. Sleep was measured using BodyMedia's SenseWear® armband. Diet was assessed using two 24-hr dietary recalls. Energy-density Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DIITM) scores were calculated from micro and macronutrients. Linear mixed-effects models estimated the impact of the E-DII score on sleep parameters. Women with more pro-inflammatory diets, compared to those with more anti-inflammatory diets, were more likely to be nulliparous (51% vs. 25%, p = 0.03), frequent consumers of fast food (29% vs. 10% consuming on 4-6 days during the previous week, p = 0.01), ever-smokers (21% vs. 6%, p = 0.02), and younger (mean age 29.2 vs. 31.3 years, p = 0.02). For every one-unit increase (i.e., more pro-inflammatory) in the E-DII score, sleep latency increased by 0.69 min (p < 0.01). Among European Americans only, every one-unit higher E-DII was associated with a 2.92-min longer wake-after-sleep-onset (p = 0.02). An E-DII score that is 5 points lower (i.e., more anti-inflammatory) would equate to about 105 min of additional sleep per week among European American women. Anti-inflammatory diets may help to counteract detriments in sleep during pregnancy, especially among European American women. Additional work is needed among African American women.

We analyzed data from the Seventh Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII) collected from 2016 to 2018. With the screenings by age (45 to 64), edentate, and the adequacy of information provided, the analysis was confined to a selected group of respondents of 4407 with measurements for the sleep survey and periodontal health status out of total 24,269. Periodontitis was defined according to the World Health Organization's community periodontal index (CPI) code greater than or equal to three, and severe periodontitis was defined as CPI code 4. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to test the association between sleep and periodontitis controlling the confounding factors. Those who went to bed during the daytime were associated with periodontitis (OR = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 2.07). In a combined sleep time and duration model, those who went to bed at night with a sleep duration of 9 hours or more were associated with periodontitis (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.77) and severe periodontitis (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.02-3.45). WBC count had the highest impact on the association between sleep time and periodontitis. Our findings suggest that an extra-long sleep duration and going to bed during the daytime are associated with periodontitis."

A total of 35,414 children were recruited in the survey. Body mass index (BMI) was converted into three categories: normal weight, overweight and obesity. In multinomial logistic regression model, sleep duration was divided into four groups: very short, short, recommended and long. In restricted cubic splines (RCS), sleep duration was examined as a continuous variable in relation to overweight and obesity. In the very short and short groups, sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity after adjusting for the potential impacts of age, gender, residence, family income, leisure sedentary behavior (SB) and leisure exercise, with OR (Odds Ratio) = 3.01 (95% CI (confidence interval): 2.19-4.15) and OR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.14-1.35), respectively. The adjusted OR of overweight for short sleep duration relative to a recommended sleep duration was 1.17(95% CI: 1.09-1.26). No significant associations of very short sleep with overweight, of long sleep duration with overweight and obesity were found. The RCS curves between sleep duration and overweight and obesity were both inverted J-shaped. To conclude, the shorter the sleep duration, the higher the risk of overweight and obesity in children. Increasing sleep duration would have a positive effect on reducing overweight and obesity rates in Chinese children."

Higher socioeconomic deprivation was associated with shorter sleep and poorer mental health after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, race, education, income, and body mass index) in the multivariable linear regression models. Those in the highest socioeconomically deprived areas had 1.6 and 1.5 times higher odds of short sleep (duration < 6 h) and poor mental health (>14 poor mental health days), respectively, in the logistic regression models. Previous researchers have focused on limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income. We examined the role of a composite area based measure of socioeconomic deprivation in sleep duration and mental health during the first year of COVID-19. Our results suggest the need for a broader framework to understand the associations among socioeconomic deprivation, sleep duration, and mental health during a catastrophic event."

We performed a cross-sectional study of 9991 adult participants of the Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS), as part of the Prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran (PERSIAN). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between short (< 6 h) and long (> 9 h) sleep duration with demographic and lifestyle parameters and common non-communicable diseases. Additionally, we performed stratified analysis to investigate the association of sleep duration with the abovementioned factors and diseases, in groups with and without hypnotic drug use. We found higher odds of SSD significantly associated with age (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001), physical activity (P < 0.001), and depression (P = 0.023). LSD displayed a positive association with the female sex (P < 0.001), opium consumption (P < 0.001), and history of MI (P = 0.045), and a reverse connection with education (P = 0.007), physical activity (P < 0.001) and alcohol consumption (P = 0.027).

Systolic BP dipping level was used to represent nighttime BP dipping. The SD of sleep duration was calculated as the index of sleep variability, and the SD of sleep midpoint was calculated as the index of sleep irregularity. A 1-hour increase in the SD of sleep midpoint was associated with a 1.16% decrease in nighttime BP dipping ( Sleep variability and sleep irregularity are associated with blunted BP dipping in the general population. In addition, data from the present investigation also demonstrate that the ethnic difference in sleep irregularity could partly explain the ethnic difference in BP dipping, an important finding that may help reduce the health disparity between Black participants and European Americans."

        "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between sleep characteristics and college degree attainment. Participants were 968 college students (72% female; mean age 19.7 [1.7]). Participants completed a psychosocial and sleep questionnaire battery followed by one week of daily sleep diaries. Academic degree completion data was obtained from the university registrar 10 years later. Logistic regression examined whether mean and variability in sleep duration and sleep efficiency and insomnia symptoms predicted degree attainment, adjusting for age, gender, semester, grade point average (GPA), and perceived stress. The strongest predictors of degree attainment were female gender (OR = 0.67), greater age (OR = 1.32), GPA (OR = 1.97), and lower intraindividual variability in sleep duration (OR = 0.99). Results highlight the importance of examining variability in sleep duration in addition to mean sleep duration in predicting college retention. Future research should use a combination of objective and subjective measures to explore the impact of sleep factors, including variability, on degree completion and other academic metrics."

This secondary data analysis of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcome Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Sleep Duration and Continuity Study (n = 745) examined associations between mid-pregnancy sleep health indicators, multidimensional sleep health and gestational weight gain (GWG). Sleep domains (i.e. regularity, nap duration, timing, efficiency and duration) were assessed via actigraphy between 16 and 21 weeks of gestation. We defined 'healthy' sleep in each domain with empirical thresholds. Multidimensional sleep health was based on sleep profiles derived from latent class analysis and composite score defined as the sum of healthy sleep domains. Total GWG, the difference between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and the last measured weight before delivery, was converted to z-scores using gestational age- and BMI-specific charts. GWG was defined as low (<-1 SD), moderate (-1 or +1 SD) and high (>+1 SD). Nearly 50% of the participants had a healthy sleep profile (i.e. healthy sleep in most domains), whereas others had a sleep profile defined as having varying degrees of unhealthy sleep in each domain. The individual sleep domains were associated with a 20%-30% lower risk of low or high GWG. Each additional healthy sleep indicator was associated with a 10% lower risk of low (vs. moderate), but not high, GWG. Participants with late timing, long duration and low efficiency (vs. healthy) profiles had the strongest risk of low GWG (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.9, 2.4). Probabilistic bias analysis suggested that most associations between individual sleep health indicators, sleep health profiles and GWG were biased towards the null. Future research should determine whether sleep health is an intervention target for healthy GWG."

These behaviors included dietary patterns, screen time, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, oral hygiene, unsafe sex, and sleep duration and quality. We documented the significant impacts of parental, school, and sociodemographic factors on the adoption of numerous lifestyle behaviors in this age category. Several health consequences could be attributed to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors during childhood and adolescence. For example, poor dietary habits can lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Physical inactivity contributes to the development of musculoskeletal and psychological disorders. Excessive screen time is associated with visual acuity problems, poor sleep, and psychological and behavioral problems. Tobacco use poses a significant risk for severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Risky sexual behaviors are related to sexually transmitted infections and exposure to violence. Short sleep duration is associated with a lack of physical fitness and poor cognitive function. However, potential interventions, such as school-based health programs, community outreach initiatives, and national health policies and regulations, can improve lifestyle behaviors among children and adolescents."

Sleep is significantly correlated with cognitive function, but both cognitive impairment and sleep problems increase with normal aging. This study explored how sleep duration affects cognitive performance among older adults in China. Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2014 and 2018, cognitive function was assessed The empirical study showed a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and increased risk of cognitive impairment. Short (< 6 hours) and long (> 8 hours) sleep durations were positively associated with cognitive impairment. Tests of interactions between sleep duration and sleep quality showed that short sleep durations with fair sleep quality had an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Further, the participants were divided into three groups: normal cognition (MMSE > 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 18 ≤ MMSE score ≤ 24), and severe cognitive impairment (MMSE < 18). First, of the participants with normal cognition at baseline, those who sleeping > 7 h at follow-up and > 7 h at both baseline and 4-year follow-up assessments could increase the risk of cognitive impairment. Second, for individuals with MCI at baseline, those who transitioned to sleeping > 7 h at follow-up period and > 7 h at both baseline and 4-year follow-up assessments had a lower chance of reverting to normal cognition. Excessive sleep may be a major risk for cognitive impairment among older adults. Furthermore, a moderate amount of sleep could be a possible strategy to prevent cognitive impairment."

We characterized sleep duration and its cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with adiposity markers in adolescence. Seven-day accelerometry was performed in a cohort of adolescents enrolled in the SI! Program for Secondary Schools trial in Spain at approximately ages 12 (1216 adolescents, 49.6% girls), 14 (1026 adolescents, 51.3% girls), and 16 (872 adolescents, 51.7% girls) years. Participants were classified as very short sleepers (VSS; <7 h), short sleepers (SS; 7-<8 h), or recommended-time sleepers (RTS; 8-10 h). Adjusted associations between sleep duration and adiposity markers were analysed using generalized linear and Poisson models. At ∼12 years, 33.7% of adolescents met sleep recommendations, and this percentage decreased with advancing age (22.6% at ∼14 and 18.7% at ∼16 years). Compared with RTS, overweight/obesity prevalence ratios at ∼12, 14, and 16 years among SS were 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.30], 1.41 (95% CI: 1.34-1.48), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.77-1.26) and among VSS were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.28-1.32), 1.93 (95% CI: 1.41-2.64), and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.26-1.37). Compared with adolescents who always met sleep recommendations, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was ∼5 times higher in those never meeting recommendations or meeting them only once. Similar trends were observed for the waist-to-height ratio (P = 0.010) and fat mass index (P = 0.024). Most adolescents did not meet sleep recommendations. Shorter sleep duration was independently associated with unfavourable adiposity markers, and such adverse impact was cumulative. Health promotion programmes should emphasize the importance of good sleep habits. This study used a wearable activity tracker to analyse sleep patterns and their association with adiposity markers in a large cohort of adolescents at ages 12, 14, and 16 years.At 12 years, only 34% of adolescents met sleep recommendations (eight or more hours of sleep per day), and this percentage decreased with advancing age (23% at 14 and 19% at 16 years). Adolescents sleeping <8 h a day were more likely to present overweight, obesity, or other adverse adiposity markers than their peers with sufficient sleep.The link between insufficient sleep and adverse adiposity markers was independent of energy intake and physical activity levels, indicating that sleep itself is important. Therefore, health promotion programmes for adolescents should emphasize the importance of good sleep habits."

CMM are a common syndrome in the older adults. There may be an association between sleep duration and CMM in older adults, with both insomnia and sleep deprivation having an impact on the health of older adults. Therefore, it is important to explore the possibility that older adults who sleep for a few hours per day may have a lower prevalence of CMM. The study included 9710 older adults. The sleep duration in this study was assessed by the question \"How many hours of sleep do you currently get in a day? \". Older adults were defined as having CMM when they had two or more of the five categories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke or cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the association among sleep duration and CMM. Restrictive cubic splines were used to examine the shape of the association among sleep duration and the CMM. The STROBE checklist was used for this cross-sectional study. The mean age was 84.78 ± 11.73 years, with 55.5 % being female. Of the total sample, 21.3 % were CMM. When all covariates were adjusted, there was dose-response relationship between sleep duration and CMM. The dose-response relationship between CMM and sleep duration showed that older adults had a lower risk of cardiovascular and metabolic multimorbidity when they slept 9 h and 10 h per day. With the increasing population of older adults, the number of older adults suffering from CMM continues to rise, and adequate sleep time can effectively prevent the occurrence of CMM. We should pay attention to the sleep problem of the older adults. This study provided information for healthcare providers to identify circumstances that increase cardiovascular metabolic multimorbidity and suggest the appropriate sleep duration per day to reduce the risk of disease in older adults. Because of the public database data used in this study, all data were collected by survey agency personnel, so this section is not applicable to this study."

Subjective sleep quality, fatigue were measured daily, with stress and recovery measured weekly. Multi-level models assessed relationships between sleep, and stress, recovery, and fatigue. Objective daily means for sleep duration were 6.3 h (± 1.2 h) and 85.6% (± 5.5%) for sleep efficiency. Main effects were detected for all mean weekly values (p < 0.05). Sleep quality showed the strongest relationships with stress, recovery and fatigue. The best model to explain relationships between, stress, recovery and fatigue, included sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency and awakenings. The reported mean sleep duration of 6.3 h per night may negatively impact training outcomes across BMT. Combining both subjective and objective measures of sleep best explained relationships between sleep metrics stress, fatigue and recovery. Perceived sleep quality was most strongly related to change in stress, recovery, or post-sleep fatigue."

The gender distribution of the participants was even, and 70.98% of them were married. After adjusting for age and sex, the following three factors had a significant impact on daytime functioning: bedtime, sleep onset latency, and sleep duration. (OR = 1.12, P < 0.038, OR = 1.01, P < 0.011, and OR = 0.99, P = 0.01, respectively). We also found that longer sleep onset latency (P = 0.004) and shorter sleep durations (P = 0.029) significantly interfere with daytime functioning. Iranians' sleep characteristics, especially their sleep duration and sleep onset latency, are associated with their daytime function. Interventions on people's sleep hygiene are warranted to promote healthier sleep behaviors among Iranians, considering the high impact of current sleep characteristics on their daily lives."

The study protocol was based on a prospective longitudinal quasi-experimental design. Participants (n = 26; 9 males; mean age, 12.4 ± 1.68 years) were patients in the Postgraduate Orthodontic Clinic, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. All patients received treatment with a cervical headgear having an embedded TheraMon microsensor. Sleep was assessed by wrist-worn actigraphy for 59 ± 19 days. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess average daytime sleepiness, whereas we used the Athens Insomnia Scale for insomnia symptoms. Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) was assessed by the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Patients slept on average 7.35 ± 0.42 h/d. Compared with the lowest sleep duration recommended for their age group, patients had an average chronic sleep deficit of 1.40 ± 0.49 h/d. Patients wore the headgear 90.9% of the days for 10.40 ± 4.17 h/d. However, only 7 (28%) patients reached or exceeded the wear-time recommendation of 12 h/d. In contrast, 2 (8%) patients wore headgear <5 h/d, 11 (44%) 5-10 h/d, and 12 (48%) patients wore headgear >10 h/d. Aggregated by participants, the median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score during the study was 3.40 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.85; range, 0.2-13.6), the median Athens Insomnia Scale score was 3.00 (IQR, 4.25; range, 0-7), and the median Oral Health Impact Profile score was 1.40 (IQR, 4.17; range, 0.0-20.8). Compared with patients who wore the orthodontic appliance >7.8 h/d, patients who wore it <7.8 h/d had worse average daytime sleepiness (P = 0.050) and worse OHRQOL (P = 0.019). Orthodontic treatment with cervical headgear has no substantive negative effect on sleep attributes (quantity and quality), average daytime sleepiness and OHRQOL. However, poor compliance with orthodontic treatment seems to be associated with higher levels of daytime sleepiness."

Prior reviews have focused on a school-aged population. Moreover, it is crucial that research continuously addresses the processes of technology and media use and the implication on sleep. This systematic review examines the evidence of electronic media use related to sleep among 0-15-year-olds. Searches were carried out in four databases (CINAHL, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Medline). Inclusion criteria included age ≤ 15 years, and intervention, cohort, or cross-sectional studies from western countries. Methodological quality was rated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies by two independent reviewers. Data was extracted using a standardized data extraction form. Synthesis was done by summarizing results across studies by age groups of 0-5, 6-12, and 13-15 years within four sleep domains: Bedtime and sleep onset; Sleep quality; Sleep duration; Daytime tiredness. The search identified 10,719 unique studies, of which 109 fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and were assessed for methodological quality. In total, 49 studies were included in the review. The study designs were randomized controlled trials (n = 3), quasi-experimental studies (n = 2), prospective cohort studies (n = 15), and cross-sectional studies (n = 29). Evidence for an association between electronic media use and sleep duration was identified, with stronger evidence for 6-15-years-olds than 0-5-year-olds. The evidence for a relationship between electronic media use and other sleep outcomes was more inconclusive. However, for 6-12-year-old children, there was evidence for associations of electronic media use with delayed bedtime and poor sleep quality. For 13-15-year-olds, there was evidence for associations between screen time and problems falling asleep, and between social media use and poor sleep quality. Overall, electronic media use was generally associated with shorter sleep duration in children and adolescents. Studies with stronger research design and of higher quality are needed to draw solid conclusions about electronic media's impact on other sleep outcomes. Public awareness and interventions could be promoted about the potential negative impact on children's sleep of electronic media devices that are used excessively and close to bedtime."

        "abstract": "Sleep quality is an important clinical construct since it is increasingly common for people to complain about poor sleep quality and its impact on daytime functioning. Moreover, poor sleep quality can be an important symptom of many sleep and medical disorders. However, objective measures of sleep quality, such as polysomnography, are not readily available to most clinicians in their daily routine, and are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for epidemiological and research studies., Several self-report questionnaires have, however, been developed. The present review aims to address their psychometric properties, construct validity, and factorial structure while presenting, comparing, and discussing the measurement properties of these sleep quality questionnaires. A systematic literature search, from 2008 to 2020, was performed using the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus, with predefined search terms. In total, 49 articles were analyzed from the 5734 articles found. The psychometric properties and factor structure of the following are reported: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), SLEEP-50 Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). As the most frequently used subjective measurement of sleep quality, the PSQI reported good internal reliability and validity; however, different factorial structures were found in a variety of samples, casting doubt on the usefulness of total score in detecting poor and good sleepers. The sleep disorder scales (AIS, ISI, MSQ, JSS, LSEQ and SLEEP-50) reported good psychometric properties; nevertheless, AIS and ISI reported a variety of factorial models whereas LSEQ and SLEEP-50 appeared to be less useful for epidemiological and research settings due to the length of the questionnaires and their scoring. The MSQ and JSS seemed to be inexpensive and easy to administer, complete, and score, but further validation studies are needed. Finally, the ESS had good internal consistency and construct validity, while the main challenges were in its factorial structure, known-group difference and estimation of reliable cut-offs. Overall, the self-report questionnaires assessing sleep quality from different perspectives have good psychometric properties, with high internal consistency and test-retest reliability, as well as convergent/divergent validity with sleep, psychological, and socio-demographic variables. However, a clear definition of the factor model underlying the tools is recommended and reliable cut-off values should be indicated in order for clinicians to discriminate poor and good sleepers."

The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an overview of studies published on ARFID and autism in 2022 and the first half of 2023. ARFID and autism are highly heritable conditions that often co-occur. In a large autism cohort, 21% of participants and 17% of their parents presented with avoidant-restrictive features. Of children diagnosed with ARFID, 8.2-54.8% are autistic. More than half of individuals with ARFID also have other neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, or somatic diagnoses. Anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and learning difficulties are particularly common co-occurring issues. Various strategies have been developed to support autistic children with feeding difficulties. It appears that their feeding difficulties, particularly sensory sensitivities, food preferences, and mealtime rituals and routines frequently persist into adolescence and adulthood, but research on optimal support for adults and adolescents is still scarce. Untreated ARFID in autistic individuals may lead to serious complications. Individuals seeking specialist care for autism, eating disorders, or gender dysphoria should be screened for ARFID. More research is needed on how to support autistic adolescents and adults with features of ARFID."

        "abstract": "Physical activity, including walking, has numerous health benefits in older adults, supported by a plethora of observational and interventional studies. Walking decreases the risk or severity of various health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and dementia, while also improving mental well-being, sleep, and longevity. Dose-response relationships for walking duration and intensity are established for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Walking's favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors are attributed to its impact on circulatory, cardiopulmonary, and immune function. Meeting current physical activity guidelines by walking briskly for 30 min per day for 5 days can reduce the risk of several age-associated diseases. Additionally, low-intensity physical exercise, including walking, exerts anti-aging effects and helps prevent age-related diseases, making it a powerful tool for promoting healthy aging. This is exemplified by the lifestyles of individuals in Blue Zones, regions of the world with the highest concentration of centenarians. Walking and other low-intensity physical activities contribute significantly to the longevity of individuals in these regions, with walking being an integral part of their daily lives. Thus, incorporating walking into daily routines and encouraging walking-based physical activity interventions can be an effective strategy for promoting healthy aging and improving health outcomes in all populations. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the vast and consistent evidence supporting the health benefits of physical activity, with a specific focus on walking, and to discuss the impact of walking on various health outcomes, including the prevention of age-related diseases. Furthermore, this review will delve into the evidence on the impact of walking and low-intensity physical activity on specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging, providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms through which walking exerts its beneficial anti-aging effects."

        "abstract": "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and youth worldwide were suddenly confronted with unprecedented consequences. The first line of concern was related to the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. While severe physical health symptomatology including death following infection was found to be less common in children than in adults,1 long-COVID has been identified in the pediatric population with the most prevalent manifestations involving mood symptoms, sleep difficulties, and fatigue.2 Secondly, the measures against COVID-19 carried their own set of risks. Many governments imposed national lockdowns, schools closed, remote learning started operating and social distancing measures prevented families from visiting public places or meeting people from other households. Isolation, disruption of everyday routines, and a sharp and dramatic decrease in physical activity and social interaction levels became the new reality experienced by children and adolescents of all age groups.3 Cross-sectional community studies on children and adolescents conducted early in the course of the pandemic indicated elevated levels of loneliness, anxiety, and behavioral problems in youth samples, even during the initial phases of the outbreak.4 Systematic reviews of mainly cross-sectional studies that followed indicated a significant rise in clinically significant anxiety and depression symptoms among children and adolescents compared to pre-pandemic levels5 and high prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and sleep disorders.6 A recent systematic review that included data from 55,000 children and adolescents from many countries of the world (mean age 11.3 years) reported that anxiety (range = 1.8–49.5%), depression (range = 2.2– 63.8%), irritability (range = 16.7–73.2%) and anger (range = 30.0–51.3%) were frequently reported by children and adolescents during the pandemic.7 However, the experience of the pandemic was not homogenous among all youth. Possible risk factors included the presence of mental health problems before the pandemic, excessive exposure to media, and high COVID-19 caseload in the community, while the presence of any kind of family routines and good parent-child communication were identified as protective factors.7 Females and older adolescents were also reported to be at greater risk for adverse mental health outcomes. In most countries, the spread of the infection, on one hand, and the enforcement of lockdowns and other containment measures, on the other, have put health care under tremendous pressure, leaving families with children with mental health disorders with minimal or inadequate support. Nevertheless, differences were also observed within the group of children with psychiatric or developmental disorders diagnosed before the pandemic. Numerous studies that have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures on children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders reported a significant increase in parental stress, as well as high levels of anxiety, irritability, hyperactivity, stereotypical behavior, and other behavioral problems among children and adolescents.8 Further studies that investigated the issue of neurodevelopmental disorders showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately and adversely affected children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with a recent meta-analysis pointing to a global increase in ADHD symptoms.9 Finally, early concerns about a possible significant increase in suicidality among youth during the pandemic were followed by contradicting findings from relevant studies. On the whole, though, it is suggested that during the pandemic, as previously, higher rates of suicidal ideation than of suicidal behaviors and suicide events were reported among children and adolescents.10 Similar patterns of mental health difficulties to those described above have also been identified in youth in Greece. During the early stages of the pandemic, one-third (35.1%) of the parents reported that their child’s psychological health was considerably affected,11 while a study of final-year high-school students found that the rates of severe depression and anxiety increased significantly during the lockdown.12 Among children and adolescents with pre-existing mental health problems from different parts of the country, no change was found in mood state scores pre- and post-pandemic onset, while several of their daily behaviors worsened during the lockdown, such as reduced sleep or time spent outdoors.13 Such research findings related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures should guide the follow-up of children and young people affected by it and inform the design of effective health strategies and policies in the post-pandemic era with the aim to prevent and mitigate further mental health crises."

        "abstract": "Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia caused by increased platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. First-line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti-D immunoglobulin. For patients who are refractory to these therapies, those who become corticosteroid dependent, or relapse following treatment with corticosteroid, options include splenectomy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin-receptor agonists, alongside a variety of additional immunosuppressive and experimental therapies. Despite recent advances in the management of ITP, many areas need further research. Although it is recognized that an assessment of patient-reported outcomes in ITP is valuable to understand and guide treatment, these measures are not routinely measured in the clinical setting. Consequently, although corticosteroids are first-line therapies for both children and adults, there are no data to suggest that corticosteroids improve health-related quality of life or other patient-related outcomes in either children or adults. In fact, long courses of corticosteroids, in either children or adults, may have a negative impact on a patient's health-related quality of life, secondary to the impact on sleep disturbance, weight gain, and mental health. In adults, additional therapies may be needed to treat overt hemorrhage, but unfortunately the results are transient for the majority of patients. Therefore, there is a need to recognize the limitations of current existing therapies and evaluate new approaches, such as individualized treatment based on the probability of response and the size of effect on the patient's most bothersome symptoms and risk of adverse effects or complications. Finally, a validated screening tool that identifies clinically significant patient-reported outcomes in routine clinical practice would help both patients and physicians to effectively follow a patient's health beyond simply treating the laboratory findings and physical symptoms of ITP. The goal of this narrative review is to discuss management of newly diagnosed and refractory patients with ITP, with a focus on the limitations of current therapies from the patient's perspective."

The hospital environment can have a negative impact on sleep quality, through factors such as noise, light, temperature, and nursing care disruptions. Poor sleep can lead to delays in recovery, wound healing, and increase risk of post-operative infection. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of non-pharmacological sleep interventions for improving inpatient sleep. The primary outcome was sleep quality, the secondary outcome was length of hospital stay, the harm outcome was adverse events. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 17 76 studies identified with 5375 people randomised comparing 85 interventions. Interventions focused on physical sleep aids (n = 26), relaxation (n = 25), manual therapy (n = 12), music (n = 9), psychological therapy (n = 5), light therapy (n = 3), sleep protocols (n = 2), milk and honey (n = 1), exercise (n = 1), and nursing care (n = 1). In meta-analysis, medium to large improvements in sleep quality were noted for sleep aids, relaxation, music, and manual therapies. Results were generally consistent in studies at lower risk of bias. Length of hospital stay and adverse events were reported for some studies, with benefit in some trials but this was not consistent across all interventions. Physical sleep aids, relaxation, manual therapy and music interventions have a strong evidence base for improving inpatient sleep quality. Research is needed to evaluate how to optimise interventions into routine care."

Today we know that our needs and influencers of skin health and skin aging change throughout our life journey due to both extrinsic factors, such as environmental factors and lifestyle factors, as well as our intrinsic factors. Furthermore, we need to consider our microflora, a collection of micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which is a living ecosystem in our gut and on our skin, that can have a major impact on our health. Here, we are viewing a holistic approach to understand the collective effect of the key influencers of skin health and skin aging both reviewing how each of them impact the skin, but more importantly to identify molecular conjunction pathways of these different factors in order to get a better understanding of the integrated \"genome-microbiome-exposome\" effect. For this purpose and in order to translate molecularly the impact of the key influencers of skin health and skin aging, we built a digital model based on system biology using different bioinformatics tools. This model is considering both the positive and negative impact of our genome (genes, age/gender), exposome: external (sun, pollution, climate) and lifestyle factors (sleep, stress, exercise, nutrition, skin care routine), as well as the role of our skin microbiome, and allowed us in a first application to evaluate the effect of the genome in the synthesis of collagen in the skin and the determination of a suitable target for boosting pro-collagen synthesis. In conclusion, we have, through our digital holistic approach, defined the skin interactome concept, as an advanced tool to better understand the molecular genesis of skin aging and further develop a strategy to balance the influence of the exposome and microbiome to protect, prevent, and delay the appearance of skin aging signs and preserve good skin health condition. In addition, this model will aid in identifying and optimizing skin treatment options based on external triggers, as well as helping to design optimal treatments modulating the intrinsic pathways."

Measuring its impact on mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents is crucial. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH-FIT - www.coh-fit.com) is an on-line anonymous survey, available in 30 languages, involving >230 investigators from 49 countries supported by national/international professional associations. COH-FIT has thee waves (until the pandemic is declared over by the WHO, and 6-18 months plus 24-36 months after its end). In addition to adults, COH-FIT also includes adolescents (age 14-17 years), and children (age 6-13 years), recruited via non-probability/snowball and representative sampling and assessed via self-rating and parental rating. Non-modifiable/modifiable risk factors/treatment targets to inform prevention/intervention programs to promote health and prevent mental and physical illness in children and adolescents will be generated by COH-FIT. Co-primary outcomes are changes in well-being (WHO-5) and a composite psychopathology P-Score. Multiple behavioral, family, coping strategy and service utilization factors are also assessed, including functioning and quality of life. Up to June 2021, over 13,000 children and adolescents from 59 countries have participated in the COH-FIT project, with representative samples from eleven countries. Cross-sectional and anonymous design. Evidence generated by COH-FIT will provide an international estimate of the COVID-19 effect on children's, adolescents' and families', mental and physical health, well-being, functioning and quality of life, informing the formulation of present and future evidence-based interventions and policies to minimize adverse effects of the present and future pandemics on youth."

Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider psychological resilience but also to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19."

        "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic outburst, numerous studies have reported on the holistic approach of the disease, which has negative consequences on physical and mental health as well as short- and long-term effects on cognition, independently of age. The context of the pandemic brought significant demands on public health systems, leading to restrictive measures against coronavirus expansion (quarantines, physical distancing policies, etc.). Such measures are reported to increase perceived loneliness and helplessness and may exacerbate feelings of emotional distress.1 Elderly diagnosed with neurocognitive disorders, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, may present multifaceted cognitive deficits accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms, medical comorbidities, and high mortality rates. Furthermore, elderly with MCI/dementia are more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection and disease complications due to decreased compliance with protective measures and multimorbidity. Simultaneously, limited access to health care services, distancing from their loved ones, abrupt changes in their daily routines or cancellation of daycare programs may make them more susceptible to pandemic secondary effects. According to the World Health Organization about 55 million people live with dementia globally. Dementia diagnosis was reported as an independent risk factor for increased mortality rate among the elderly infected with SARS-COV-2.2 Cross-sectional studies conducted all over Europe reported increased cognitive deterioration rate in patients with MCI and dementia during lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period, as well as among dementia patients infected with COVID-19 compared to those not infected.3 Exacerbation of pre-existing sleep/appetite dysregulation and aberrant motor behavior, worsened symptoms of apathy, depression, and agitation, a rise in delirium episodes and disease-related falls and onset of behavioral symptoms during quarantine occurred.4 Also, patients living alone expressed excessive worrying and an overall decline in well-being. However, results from a large cohort study conducted in England failed to distinguish COVID-19 effects on dementia patients' psychological state between 2018 and 2020, possibly due to the small number of dementia patients recruited and disease severity.5 Among the Greek elderly, dementia prevalence rates range between 5-10.8% and 32.4% for MCI incidence.6,7 Only a few studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 quarantine on mental and psychological health of the Greek elderly diagnosed with cognitive disorders. A longitudinal study was conducted between 2018 and 2020 including a rather large number of elderly people with MCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The authors compared the objectively assessed deterioration difference pre- and during the quarantine in terms of cognition, behavior and function level. They concluded that no significant quarantine-related changes were detected in cognition between the three time points, although the possibility that behavioral and psychological deterioration indirectly affected cognitive and functional decline among AD patients cannot be excluded.8 In a cross-sectional study conducted during the first quarantine period (i.e., February to May 2020), critical aspects of everyday life (mood, physical health, communication) as well as compliance with confinement policies were examined based on subjective information provided by caregivers of elderly with MCI or dementia. Based on their findings, the authors report that MCI and dementia patients exhibited a significant overall decline, whereas those with dementia were more likely to deteriorate in terms of neuropsychiatric symptoms (apathy, mood changes, psychomotor anxiety), excessive worrying, and limited compliance with measures against COVID-19 expansion.9 In an effort to minimize possible deleterious effects of the pandemic-related quarantine on the elderly with neurocognitive disorders, telemedicine was implemented instead. Neuropsychological online testing, systematic monitoring of clinical outcome (compliance with pharmacotherapy) and motivational interventions such as physical activity programs were accommodated using user-friendly applications and telephone consultations.10 Nevertheless, limited access to and familiarization with technology, severity of cognitive deficits, and demographic factors (i.e., low educational and socioeconomic status), may have limited positive outcomes in the current population. In conclusion, the combined effect of neurocognitive disorders and the pandemic exceeds the healthcare system's demands, posing in some cases insurmountable challenges. To minimize the negative effect of future similar conditions, focus should be given on the following directions: Patient-oriented, holistic protocols for systematic monitoring of clinical course, future cognitive decline, and timely psychiatric/neuropsychological interventions when necessary. Specialized training for caregivers' and nursing staff focusing on the inclusion of self-hygiene measures in patients' daily routine. Patients' familiarization with online tools both for cognitive enhancement programs and for diagnostic/ monitoring purposes."

Sleep may be required for regulating the body's metabolism, feelings, function, memory storage, brain recovery, and learning. Because of how important these processes are, sleep should be seen as just as important to health as what you eat and how much you exercise. Adults' sleep generally gets shorter and less restful, their sleep starts later and is more broken up, they have more sleep problems, and their rest-activity rhythms get weaker. In addition to receiving enough sleep (quality), healthy sleep habits also include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. Ninety male college students with varying sleep schedules were analyzed for their physical and emotional well-being. By using factor analysis to categorize individuals' sleeping patterns across three dimensions regularity, quality, and quantity. We were able to develop sleep-habit measures. Clustering identified four distinct patterns of sleep behavior: good sleep was defined by regular, high-quality sleep despite being of comparatively brief duration; long sleep was predictable, fairly lengthy, but of minimal quality; short sleep was of excellent quality despite being short and irregular; and poor sleep was erratic, low-quality, and relatively long. The excellent sleepers also had reduced diastolic and systolic and a smaller means waist measurement. In addition, the poor sleepers had the lowest average MCS scores of all of the study groups. Poor sleepers also had the lowest mean scores on the Subjective Depression Scale (SDS). Issues involving glucose or lipid absorption were also more common in the short-term and long poor-sleep categories. Without restful sleep and a regular bedtime routine, it is impossible to maintain excellent mental and physical wellness, even if time and sleep are maintained constantly. Therefore, to produce suitable sleep recommendations for enhanced mental and physical health, we evaluated not only the quantity of sleep but also its consistency and high quality."

Hence, this study highlights the relationship between COVID-19 and insomnia and how insomnia is increasing due to the pandemic. The study's findings summarise that the COVID-19 pandemic has produced ubiquitous mental challenges, including loneliness, anxiety, fear, stress, extreme tiredness, and health concerns. It is also associated with physical issues such as social isolation, juggling work or study, parenting challenges, and significant behavior changes stemming from mass home confinement. There are also economic hardships, financial insecurity, risk, and infection. These factors lead to undoing routines and broken circadian rhythms amid the pandemic, affecting three sleep regulatory processes of the homeostatic sleep drive, the circadian rhythm, and the arousal system. Furthermore, we suggest future research directions to explore (1) long-term health impacts of the pandemic, (2) therapeutic strategies and the implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties, (3) prevention programs and clinical interventions, and (4) nationwide or cross-regional online and practical psychological and sleep management intervention systems and platforms to address the psychological strain of isolation and traumatic experiences of the pandemic."

        "abstract": "Up to 80% of children with autism experience behavioural sleep problems, predominantly relating to bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, sleep dysregulation, and shorter duration, which are associated with increased autistic symptom expression and emotional and behavioural difficulties. Researchers predicted the COVID-19 pandemic would worsen sleep and behavioural difficulties for autistic children, due to their need for routine and certainty. This systematic review is the first to focus on delineating the role of sleep disturbance in exacerbating autistic symptoms and internalising and externalising behaviours during the pandemic. In this PROSPERO registered systematic review, we aggregated and synthesised findings from empirical studies from 2020 onwards that included children with autism and examined sleep outcomes, using narrative and framework synthesis due to the variety of methods and designs employed. We identified additional relevant themes through inductive thematic analysis. Seventy-one studies met the search criteria, and we selected seventeen for review following screening and quality assessment. These studies reported mixed findings; with strongest support for worsening of sleep problems typically experienced by autistic children, including difficulties with sleep regulation and shorter sleep duration. Further, sleep problems were associated with increased expression of autistic characteristics. Preliminary findings of worsening sleep and increased autistic characteristics for autistic children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for ongoing, accessible and flexible service provision during exposure to environmental stressors. We propose that behavioural sleep interventions are well suited to telehealth adaptation and play an important role in supporting families when in-person treatment for sleep problems is not possible."

These include a synthesis of review articles and sources in electronic databases CONCLUSION: SWD is a prevalent and debilitating problem for millions of people living with cancer. If not addressed, SWD can negatively impact physical and psychological recovery from cancer. Multiple factors contribute to SWD among patients with cancer including a variety of physical symptoms related to cancer and its treatment including fatigue, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms. When SWD risk factors are predicted and clinical features evaluated, there are several treatment options and strategies available to help patients in a timely manner. There is a substantial body of evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions and behavioral treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). Growing evidence supports exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction to diminish SWD. Sleep needs to be prioritized in cancer care, but dedicated effort and resources are needed to address the patient, clinician, institutional, and societal barriers to routine sleep evaluation and effective delivery of SWD interventions. It is important for oncology providers to be educated regarding both pharmacologic and nonpharmacological treatments. Strategies for management of SWD in the context of cancer care delivery and future research are discussed in the context of the predictive preventive and personalized medicine framework (PPPM)."

Empirical studies identified in the following databases: MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge/Web of Science, and preprint servers. The findings point to a wide range of consequences for children and adolescents resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which mainly includes an increase in depressive mood symptoms. There is also an increase in anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, as well as potential delays in language and motor development resulting from deprivation of social interaction and the closing of schools. These effects are more severe due to previous neuropsychiatric conditions. For parents, there is an increase in anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic symptoms, which are more accentuated in those who suffered socioeconomic damage due to the pandemic. There was an important increase in situations of violence towards children by parents and caregivers during the pandemic. Also, changes in routine and fear of the pandemic have negatively impacted sleep quality, globally. It is noteworthy that most studies published to date used a cross-sectional design and applied online screening questionnaires. The few studies with a longitudinal design suggest that these changes may have been transitory and more prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic."

One year into the pandemic, over 200 million students still faced disruptions to their education. Nearing the end of another academic year that has occurred entirely during the pandemic, many schools remained fully or partially closed for in-person education, altering routines and representing potential hardships to the next generation and their families. This article will explore the potential impacts of school closures on children and adolescents related to increased screen time, irregular sleep patterns, less balanced diets, learning difficulties, and changes in social interaction. In addition, we note broader familial difficulties likely accompanying the loss of the mitigating effects of schools and their associated support systems, such as parental stress and work responsibilities, loss of employment, intimate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, and parental substance abuse, which appear to have increased during the pandemic. Considering what is known about the impact from previous natural catastrophes, the populations at risk, and the early but not yet definitive data from the current pandemic, we stress the urgent need for robust data as we prepare for a new academic year in the Northern Hemisphere. Although we currently lack consistent and complete data, signs for concern include a rise in pediatric emergency room visits for mental health and substance use issues in many parts of the world. This paper aims to stimulate a discussion about the potential mental health effects of school closures for children and adolescents in the context of a pandemic."

J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1157-1161, 2023-The 75th Ranger Regiment (75RR) is an elite airborne infantry unit that is prepared to deploy on short notice and is resourced to maintain exceptional proficiency and readiness through prolonged deployments. Soldiers must be airborne qualified and pass a number of physical and psychological tests during training to become a member of 75RR. Rangers must maintain a level of physical performance comparable to high-level athletes while also handling operational stressors that include a negative-energy balance, high-energy expenditure, sleep restriction, and completing missions in extreme environments, all of which increase their chance of illness or infection. There are also situations of heighted injury risk, such as parachuting and repelling, which are routinely required in combat operations. Thus far, only one screening tool to assess injury risk has been developed. There are also physical training programs to enhance performance for Rangers in 75RR. This narrative review aims to evaluate the body of literature surrounding performance and health-related research in US Army Rangers to understand how Rangers are impacted during training or operations, to inform future training recommendations, and to identify areas of future research that are warranted and could potentially optimize the health and performance of Rangers during future training or operation events."

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affects all countries and populations worldwide, significantly impacting people with autism with a high risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Approximately 25% of children with autism have an asymptomatic or symptomatic immune deficiency or dysfunction. In addition, they frequently have various comorbid conditions that increase the severity of COVID-19. In addition, severe COVID-19 during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism in the offspring. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could target human nervous system tissues due to its neurotrophic effects. The COVID-19 pandemic intensely impacts many patients and families in the autism community, especially the complex management of autism-associated disorders during the complete lockdown. During the complete lockdown, children with autism had difficulties coping with the change in their routine, lack of access to special education services, limited physical space available, and problems related to food and sleep. Additionally, children with autism or intellectual disabilities are more liable to be abused by others during the pandemic when the standard community supports are no longer functioning to protect them. Early detection and vaccination of children with autism against COVID-19 are highly indicated. They should be prioritized for testing, vaccination, and proper management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss the various effects of COVID-19 on children with autism, the difficulties they face, the increased risk of infection during pregnancy, how to alleviate the impact of COVID-19, and how to correct the inequalities in children with autism."

Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies that report patient experience and perspectives on sleep in dialysis. Patients receiving dialysis. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, reference lists and PhD dissertations were searched from inception to August 2019. All text from the results/conclusion of the primary studies. Thematic synthesis. We included 48 studies involving 1156 participants from 16 countries. We identified six themes: dominating demands of treatment (with subthemes of: demanding and relentless schedule, regret for wasted time); scheduling and control (managing sleep routines, napping and nocturnal sleep disruption, meditative aids); disruptions due to dialysis (unsettled sleep, hypervigilance and worry); symptoms depriving sleep (difficulty falling asleep, constant waking); overwhelmed and without choice (futility of sleep, uncontrollable exhaustion, restlessness is irrepressible); and as a coping mechanism (avoiding anxiety, alleviating symptoms, combating boredom). Most studies were conducted in high-income, English-speaking countries. The treatment and symptom burden of dialysis disrupts and deprives patients of sleep, which leads to overwhelming and uncontrollable exhaustion. Better management of symptoms and effective strategies to manage sleep routines may improve sleep quality for better overall health in patients receiving dialysis."

Even if psychological issues in IBD patients are highly burdened in terms of quality of life, psychiatric comorbidities still receive less attention into routine care than the physical symptoms of the disease. The present review provides an overview of recent literature, focusing on the association between perceived stress and IBD outcomes. For this purpose, the epidemiology of more common psychological comorbidities in IBD and their potential effect on the onset and disease course have been examined. Moreover, therapeutic interventions in the management of these patients have also been evaluated. Screening of patients at high risk of psychological issues is currently an unmet, clinical need in the management of IBD. Under-diagnosed and under-treated mental health disorders in IBD patients may impact outcomes, leading to increased disability and health-care utilization and associated costs. A patient-tailored, integrated model of care in the management of IBD is required to optimize disease outcomes and improve patients' quality of life."

This study analyzed the impact of parental behaviors on children's lifestyles and habits, as well as the trend and intensity of the effect of these behaviors on different age groups. A systematic review of 1504 articles from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and APA PsycNet (as of 22 July 2024) included studies on parents and children aged 4-18 years, focusing on physical activity, sleep, screen time, nutrition, and mental health. Twenty-six studies were analyzed, including 19 cross-sectional and 7 longitudinal studies. The outcomes included physical activity, sedentary behaviors, eating and sleeping habits, mental health, and BMI. Bias was assessed using JBI tools according to the GRADE framework and Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment. The studies involved 89,545 youths and 13,856 parents. The key findings revealed associations between parental physical activity, sleep, dietary habits, mental health, screen time, and their children's BMIs. Parenting styles significantly influence children's behaviors. This review highlights the crucial influence of parenting styles and behaviors on children's physical activity, diet, sleep, and mental health, emphasizing the link between family dynamics and childhood obesity. The findings stress the importance of targeting parental habits in interventions focused on healthy routines and stress management. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine causality, while research involving diverse populations is essential to enhance the applicability of these findings."

        "abstract": "Nocturia (waking to void) is prevalent among older adults. Disruption of the well-described circadian rhythm in urine production with higher nighttime urine output is its most common cause. In young adults, their circadian rhythm is modulated by the 24-h secretory pattern of hormones that regulate salt and water excretion, including antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The pattern of hormone secretion is less clear in older adults. We investigated the effect of sleep on the 24-h secretion of these hormones in healthy older adults. Thirteen participants aged ≥65 yr old underwent two 24-h protocols at a clinical research center 6 wk apart. The first used a habitual wake-sleep protocol, and the second used a constant routine protocol that removed the influence of sleep, posture, and diet. To assess hormonal rhythms, plasma was collected at 8:00 am, 12:00 pm, 4:00 pm, and every 30 min from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am. A mixed-effects regression model was used to compare subject-specific and mean trajectories of hormone secretion under the two conditions. ADH, aldosterone, and ANP showed a diurnal rhythm that peaked during sleep in the wake-sleep protocol. These nighttime elevations were significantly attenuated within subjects during the constant routine. We conclude that sleep has a masking effect on circadian rhythm amplitude of ADH, aldosterone, and ANP: the amplitude of each is increased in the presence of sleep and reduced in the absence of sleep. Disrupted sleep could potentially alter nighttime urine output in healthy older adults via this mechanism."

Its causes remain unknown, although the neurotransmitter imbalance is suggested as a potential factor. This condition is closely associated with hallucinations and a sense of intrusion, often observed in patients with narcolepsy, hypertension, and seizures. A cross-sectional study was conducted in various medical colleges in Karachi, involving 297 participants aged 18 to 30 years. The participants were divided into groups based on gender and year of study. They were surveyed about the frequency of sleep paralysis episodes, their beliefs about the phenomenon, sleep routines, and academic impacts. Among the respondents, a significant number of females (n=209, 70.3%) reported experiencing sleep paralysis. The overall mean age was 20±2.0 years. Correlation analysis revealed an insignificant relationship between depression and mental anxiety (p=0.147). Similarly, no significant association was found when comparing the occurrence of sleep paralysis (p=0.16). However, a notable finding was the significant link between sleep paralysis and its impact on academics (p=0.043). This study highlighted the frequency of sleep paralysis among medical students, particularly among females. Furthermore, it emphasizes the diverse beliefs held by individuals regarding these frightening episodes. To address this neglected issue, it is essential to conduct awareness sessions aimed at understanding and alleviating sleep paralysis in individuals' lives."

Structured interviews were conducted with European experts to collect insights about (I) the personal experience with PRO; (II) the value and impact of PRO in the decision-making process at the national level; and (III) the interest for and use of PRO by national health authorities. Nine neurologists (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, and United Kingdom), three health economists (Portugal, Romania, and Sweden), and one epidemiologist (Slovakia) participated. They all stated that PRO are collected at their own countries in the context of clinical trials and/or specific projects. During everyday clinical practice, PRO are collected routinely/almost routinely in Austria and Sweden and only at the discretion of the treating physicians in Czechia, Denmark, France, Greece, and Portugal. There was complete consensus about the favorable impact that the PRO can have in terms of clinical outcomes, healthcare resources utilization, and general patient satisfaction. Only participants from Portugal and Sweden answered that the PRO are perceived as very important by the National Health Authorities of their respective countries. Differences exist in attitudes and perspectives about PRO in epilepsy across Europe. An active plan is warranted to harmonize the measurement of PRO and ensure they can be relevant to people with epilepsy and health services."

Four themes and 16 subthemes emerged: (1) sleep-related manifestations (n = 14) with four subthemes (sleep disruptors; sleepiness & napping; fatigue & low energy level; decreased cognition), (2) reduced psychological well-being and functioning (n = 14) with seven subthemes (anxiety & feeling vulnerable; hostility; sadness, sense of hopelessness & depression; embarrassment, shame & diminished self-concept; guilt & self-blame; maladaptive coping; self-stigma, (3) impaired physical and role functioning (n = 13) with three subthemes (reduced activities & routine disruption; reduced sexual activities & desire; reduced job performance & participation), (4) impaired social and relational functioning (n = 13) with two subthemes (strained interpersonal relationships; social isolation & loneliness). SA patients experienced sleep-disrupting symptoms and daytime sleepiness/fatigue which adversely impacted physical, psycho-cognitive, and social aspects of their lives in complex interactive ways. This understanding can help facilitate patient-centric care and develop comprehensive patient-reported measures to effect good health outcomes."

Despite the potential utility of TRE for improving health and reducing disease, the feasibility of adherence depends upon a variety of multilevel factors which are largely unexplored. The primary aim of our study was to explore facilitators and barriers of adherence to TRE among community-dwelling individuals. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 24 individuals (50% male; M age: 34, range: 18-57; 58% overweight/obese) who currently or formerly practiced TRE. Thematic analysis identified facilitators of and barriers to TRE adherence at multiple levels of influence (i.e., biological, behavioral, psychosocial, environmental). Key facilitators of adherence included improvements in physical health and energy levels, alignment with other aspects of diet, exercise and sleep patterns, self-monitoring and positive psychological impacts, social support, and busy or regular schedules. Key barriers included negative physical health effects, feelings of hunger and sluggishness, difficulty in skipping valued baseline eating routines or inadequate diet quality during the eating window, misalignment of TRE with 24-h activity behaviors, difficulties with self-monitoring, the need to mitigate negative feelings, social situations that discourage TRE, and irregular or idle schedules. Results illustrate that key drivers of adherence differ across individuals and their unique settings and that multiple drivers of behavior should be considered in the successful implementation of TRE. Findings may inform interventions seeking to tailor TRE schedules to fit individuals' diverse behavioral patterns and preferences, thereby optimizing adherence."

This study investigates sleep habit changes during the pandemic in 528 children 4-12 years old in the US, leveraging data from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. Data collection occurred in July 2019-March 2020 (pre-pandemic) and two pandemic periods: December 2020-April 2021 and May-August 2021. Qualitative interviews were performed in 38 participants. We found no changes in sleep duration, but a shift to later sleep midpoint during the pandemic periods. There was an increase in latency at the first pandemic collection period but no increase in the frequency of bedtime resistance, and a reduced frequency of naps during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews revealed that parents prioritized routines to maintain sleep duration but were more flexible regarding timing. Children from racial/ethnic minoritized communities slept less at night, had later sleep midpoint, and napped more frequently across all collection periods, warranting in-depth investigation to examine and address root causes. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted children sleep, but parental knowledge of the importance of sleep might have played a significant protective role. During the COVID-19 pandemic, US children changed their sleep habits, going to bed and waking up later, but their sleep duration did not change. Sleep latency was longer. Parental knowledge of sleep importance might have played a protective role. Regardless of data collection periods, children from racial/ethnic minoritized communities slept less and went to bed later. This is one of the first study on this topic in the US, including prospective pre-pandemic qualitative and quantitative data on sleep habits. Our findings highlight the pandemic long-term impact on childhood sleep. Results warrants further investigations on implications for overall childhood health."

This study aimed to systematically review and thematically synthesize the qualitative literature reporting the patient experience of gout flares, to inform the development of flare-specific outcome measures. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched in October 2019 to identify original qualitative research articles reporting on the patient experience of gout flares. Methodological quality of all included papers was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. Following data extraction, coding and synthesis was undertaken using reflexive thematic analysis. Sixteen papers reporting the patient experience of gout flares were included. The majority of CASP criteria were met by most studies, indicating good methodological quality. Four predominant and overlapping themes were identified from the thematic analysis: gout flare characteristics (pain, swelling, location, duration and frequency); impact on function and activities of daily living (walking, housework and yard work, self-care, exercise and sports, driving, sleep); effects on social and family life (social participation, inability to plan, employment, dependency, relationships, intimacy); and psychological impact (boredom, irritability, fear, shame and embarrassment, isolation, financial worry, depression and anxiety). Gout flares impact many aspects of patients' lives, including physical and psychological and social and family life. The patient experience of gout flares goes beyond what is routinely measured in research settings. Measurement and reporting methods that capture these aspects of patients' experiences with gout flares would provide more meaningful outcome measures in clinical trials of flare prevention."

Using a systematic review, 166 studies were identified within the period of January 2010 to December 2020 using the PubMed database. Of the 21 studies selected, 13 used both subjective and objective measurement methods. Six studies used only subjective and two studies only objective methods. For subjective assessment, 12 different questionnaires could be identified as well as activity and sleeping logs. Actigraphy and reaction time tests (RTT) were the most common objective methods. In single cases, electrooculography (EOG), pupillometry and ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) were used. Measurement-related limitations due to vessel-related impacts were less often reported than expected. No restrictions of daily routines on board were described, and only single-measurement disturbances due to ship movements were mentioned. The present literature review reveals that there are various routines to measure fatigue, sleepiness, and sleep behaviour on board. A combination of subjective and objective methods often appears to be beneficial. The frequent use of actigraphy and RTT on board suggests good feasibility and reliable measurements with these methods. The use of ambulatory PSG in maritime-like contexts suggests that this method would also be feasible on board."

Short message service (\"text\") messaging has proved a useful adjunct to remote consulting, allowing the transfer of photographs and documents. Maintaining the care of noncommunicable diseases is a core component of pandemic preparedness and telemedicine has developed to enable (for example) remote monitoring of sleep apnoea, telemonitoring of COPD, digital support for asthma self-management and remote delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation. There are multiple exemplars of telehealth instigated rapidly to provide care for people with COVID-19, to manage the spread of the pandemic or to maintain safe routine diagnostic or treatment services. Despite many positive examples of equivalent functionality and safety, there remain questions about the impact of remote delivery of care on rapport and the longer term impact on patient/professional relationships.

Over years, various physical, psychological, biological, and social factors have been investigated to understand their impact on sleep. However, understanding the etiological processes that are involved in causing sleep disturbances (SD) as impacted by stressful phases such as pandemics has not been well studied. Many such etiological and management strategies have surfaced during the latest \"coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The occurrence of these SD in the infected and uninfected individuals poses a need to investigate factors linked to such occurrence during this phase. Some of such factors include stressful practices such as social distancing, masking, vaccines, and medications availability, changes in routines, and lifestyles. As the status of infection improved, a collective term for all the prolonged effects of COVID-19 after the resolution of the primary infection called the post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) surfaced. Apart from impacting sleep during the infectious phase, the aftereffects of this virus left an even greater impact during the PCS. Various mechanisms have been hypothesized to be linked to such SD during the PCS, but the available data are inconclusive. Further, the varied patterns of incidence of these SDs differed by many factors, such as age, gender, and geographical location, making clinical management even more challenging. This review elucidates the impact of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID) disease on sleep health during the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigate different causal relationships, management strategies, and knowledge gaps related to SD during the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "abstract": "The interplay between Islamic prayer timings, particularly Fajr (the predawn prayer) and Isha (the night prayer), and sleep health is a critical area of study, revealing the significant impact of these religious practices on sleep patterns. Astronomical calculations used to determine these prayer times involve observing the sun's position relative to the horizon at specific degrees of twilight, which can vary, potentially leading to differences in sleep duration and quality among Muslims. This variation is influenced by factors like geography and seasonality, especially in regions far from the equator where daylight hours shift dramatically. For instance, during longer summer days in the northern latitudes, the time for Isha can extend late into the night, potentially shortening sleep if adherents rise early for Fajr. Conversely, in winter, earlier nightfalls may allow for longer sleep periods before Fajr. It is important to highlight the challenges Muslims face in balancing their spiritual obligations with the need for restful sleep. The discussion extends to the implications for healthcare providers, who must navigate cultural sensitivities and promote sleep hygiene within the framework of Islamic practice by suggesting flexible sleep schedules, the strategic use of naps, and education on the importance of maintaining consistent sleep routines."

A consistent daily schedule of quality of sleep makes a world of difference to our health and well-being. Despite its importance, so many individuals have trouble sleeping well. Poor quality sleep has such a detrimental impact on many aspects of our lives; it affects our thinking, learning, memory, and movements. Further, and most poignantly, poor quality sleep over time increases the risk of developing a serious medical condition, including neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we focus on a potentially new non-pharmacological treatment that improves the quality of sleep. This treatment, called photobiomodulation, involves the application of very specific wavelengths of light to body tissues. In animal models, these wavelengths, when applied at night, have been reported to stimulate the removal of fluid and toxic waste-products from the brain; that is, they improve the brain's inbuilt house-keeping function. We suggest that transcranial nocturnal photobiomodulation, by improving brain function at night, will help improve the health and well-being of many individuals, by enhancing the quality of their sleep."

The relation between epilepsy, sleep, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in culturally distinct environment of Pakistan remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence and predictors of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), poor sleep quality (SQ), and to analyze their association with HRQoL in people with epilepsy (PWE). A study was conducted among PWE attending two tertiary care hospitals of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The EDS, SQ, and HRQoL were evaluated by Urdu versions of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). The study included 200 PWE and 51 healthy controls with mean (SD) ages of 33.1 ± 13.9, 32.9 ± 10.9, and a disease duration of 5.01 ± 6.17, respectively. The majority of the respondents (n = 130, 65%) had poor seizure control, and most of these (n = 88, 68%) were on combination antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. In comparison to controls, a higher number of PWE had EDS by ESS (score ≥ 11, 10% vs. 40%, p-value 0.00), and poor SQ by PSQI (score > 5, 9% vs. 71%, p-value 0.00). A multiple logistic regression analysis reveals that the factors significantly associated with EDS were: female gender; increasing age; seizure control; duration of epilepsy; and combination AED therapy. A second multiple binary logistic regression analysis suggests that factors significantly associated with poor SQ were: increasing age; female gender; poor seizure control; and combination therapy. The Hierarchical multivariate analysis suggests that poor seizure control, EDS, and poor SQ were significant predictors of low HRQoL. The findings suggest high prevalence of EDS and poor SQ in PWE in Pakistan. A significant negative association exists between sleep complaints and HRQoL. During routine clinical consultations, awareness about sleep hygiene practices must be provided to enhance HRQoL."

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has presented a novel pedagogical challenge in dealing with the sudden shift from classic instruction to emergency remote teaching (ERT). It had an impact on the well-being and mental health of lecturers, increasing burnout risk. A cross-sectional, quantitative, qualitative and analytical online study was conducted to collect participants' sociodemographic data, responses to ERT open-ended questions and mental health assessments using relevant instruments (CBI for burnout, Resilience Scale, DASS for depression, anxiety and stress, SWLS for satisfaction with life). High personal burnout levels were found in 41.2% of participants, high work-related burnout in 37.3% and high student-related burnout in 15.7%. Satisfaction with life, sleep routine changes and stress were determinants for personal burnout; stress and resilience for work-related burnout; satisfaction of life and sleep routine changes for students-related burnout. Opportunities for pedagogical innovation were pointed out as the main advantages to ERT, while the main negative impacts were on practical lessons and social interaction. Students and lecturers' safety and adequate institutional support might be insured, considering their expectations and needs, promoting mental health. Combining the advantages of online and traditional methods in a so-called \"blended learning\" approach, with close collaboration and communication between all those involved, appears to achieve better results."

This study was carried out in collaboration with the 13 associations of family caregivers of persons with dementia that are part of a Regional Federation. This partnership worked towards bettering patient care and proposing improvements to the public health system. A multi-institutional cross-sectional study. A total of 462 primary family caregivers of persons with dementia from north-west Spain were included. Data were collected between January and April 2019 with an anonymous self-administered validated questionnaire (ICUB-97) based on Virginia Henderson's nursing care model. The most affected needs in family caregivers are those related to \"recreational activities\", \"communication\" and \"rest and sleep\". Statistically significant differences between male and female participants' pattern of care and health-related impacts were found, especially in issues related to work and family reconciliation. Care plans should be developed taking gender perspective into account. From a nurse model point of view, more research is necessary to reduce health disparities. This study provides an assessment of gender differences in care and the impact on caregivers' health. Regarding the specific health conditions of female caregivers and from a holistic point of view, these findings could provide novel and interesting data that might help to implement gender perspective in nursing care plans, generally invisible in routine clinical practice."

The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing literature on how COVID-19 impacted K-12 students' eating patterns, physical activity, and sleep in the United States. Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search was conducted between October and December 2021. Inclusion criteria were studies focused on COVID-19 and eating patterns, physical activity, and sleep in students enrolled in K-12 schools since March 2020. International studies were excluded. Mixed findings were observed for eating patterns whereby the consumption of unhealthful savory and sweet items and healthful snacks (e.g., fruit and vegetables) increased. Reductions in physical activity and disrupted sleep routines were also observed. Heterogeneity in methodological procedures may limit the generalizability of these findings. In the United States, preliminary data suggest that select health-promoting behaviors were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that prolonged unhealthful eating patterns, physical inactivity, and poor sleep contribute to chronic disease risk, initiatives that increase health-promoting behaviors are warranted."

Ecological momentary assessment PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine EMS workers employed at an emergency medical service provider in Central New York. Participants completed 8 daily assessments that inquired about sleep quality and anger. EMS workers who typically experienced poorer sleep quality reported greater anger levels; for instance, workers who routinely experienced poor sleep quality reported anger levels that were 18%-35% higher compared to workers receiving fair sleep quality. Regardless of their typical sleep quality, days when workers experienced poorer sleep than usual was characterized by higher levels of anger: on a day when a worker experienced poorer sleep quality than usual for them, their anger levels were 5% higher on that day regardless of their typical sleep quality. EMS workers regularly experiencing poor sleep quality experience more anger. However, even workers who typically have better sleep quality experience anger elevations following poor sleep. These findings suggest that interventions targeting both between- and within-person factors impacting sleep may be important for addressing sleep quality's influence on anger in the EMS profession."

Concept analysis. Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMED, Web of Science, and JSTOR) and definitions from online dictionaries. Rodgers' Evolutionary method was applied to guide the concept analysis to identify and determine the attributes, antecedents, and consequences. Sleep quality is defined as an individual's self-satisfaction with all aspects of the sleep experience. Sleep quality has four attributes: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset. Antecedents include physiological (e.g., age, circadian rhythm, body mass index, NREM, REM), psychological (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression), and environmental factors (e.g., room temperature, television/device use), and family/social commitments. Good sleep quality has positive effects such as feeling rested, normal reflexes, and positive relationships. Poor sleep quality consequences include fatigue, irritability, daytime dysfunction, slowed responses, and increased caffeine/alcohol intake. Sleep quality is essential, and poor sleep quality contributes to disease and poor health outcomes. Given the extensive consequences of poor sleep quality, nurses and clinicians are vital in instructing the importance of good sleep."

Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment predispose individuals to poor metabolic health and promote weight gain and have received increased research attention in the past 10 years. Insufficient sleep is defined as sleeping less than recommended for health benefits, whereas circadian misalignment is defined as wakefulness and food intake occurring when the internal circadian system is promoting sleep. This Review discusses the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in humans on appetite hormones (focusing on ghrelin, leptin and peptide-YY), energy expenditure, food intake and choice, and risk of obesity. Some potential strategies to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disruption on metabolic health are provided and future research priorities are highlighted. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic functions. Furthermore, modern working patterns, lifestyles and technologies are often not conducive to adequate sleep at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting it (for example, late-night screen time, shift work and nocturnal social activities). Efforts are needed to highlight the importance of optimal sleep and circadian health in the maintenance of metabolic health and body weight regulation."

In this framework, the aim of this work was to link current understanding about insomnia mechanisms with current knowledge about mental health dysregulatory mechanisms. The focus of the present work was on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, which represent important challenges in clinical practice. Literature searches were conducted on clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic implications for insomnia comorbid with these mental disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Insomnia may play an important role as a risk factor, a comorbid condition and transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders including mood/anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Insomnia may also play a role as a marker of disrupted neuroplasticity contributing to dysregulation of different neurobiological mechanisms involved in these different mental conditions. In this framework, insomnia treatment may not only foster normal sleep processes but also the stress system, neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. Insomnia treatment may play an important preventive and neuroprotective role with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia being the treatment with important new evidence of efficacy for insomnia, psychopathology, and indices of disrupted neuroplasticity. On the other hand, pharmacological pathways for insomnia treatment in these mental conditions are still not well defined. Therapeutic options acting on melatonergic systems and new therapeutic options acting on orexinergic systems may represents interesting pathways of interventions that may open new windows on insomnia treatment in mental disorders."

Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness."

Lack of sleep has shown to produce deficits in memory consolidation and plays an important role in brain development and brain plasticity in the several developmental stages of the human brain. At the cellular level, circadian cycles coordinate complex mechanism that \"turn on and off\" genes and cellular structures regulating individual cell functions to impact global organ and systems physiological activities. At the end a perfect and coordinated equilibrium in the mental, emotional and physiological is the goal of this complex process. Sleep impacts memory, learning, mood, behavior, immunological responses, metabolism, hormone levels, digestive process and many more physiological functions. We present a review of three basic aspects related with sleep: a. brain electrical activity during the sleep and neuroanatomic correlation with mechanism related with memory and learning; b. circadian cycles and impact in several physiological systems; c some examples of clinical disorders associated with sleep disorders and impact in learning and memory. Las investigaciones recientes demuestran que mientras estamos tranquilamente durmiendo nuestro cerebro está muy ocupado procesando la información obtenida a lo largo del día. Asimismo, la falta de sueño ocasiona problemas en la consolidación de la memoria. El sueño juega un papel fundamental en el adecuado desarrollo del cerebro en crecimiento y muchos de los fenómenos de plasticidad cerebral ocurren durante el sueño. A nivel celular, los ciclos circadianos coordinan complejos mecanismos de \"encender y apagar\" genes y estructuras que regulan individualmente y colectivamente las funciones de cada célula del organismo y a su vez de cada órgano, cada sistema fisiológico, para finalmente producir un perfecto equilibrio en el funcionamiento mental, emocional y sistémico del individuo. El sueño influye en los procesos de memoria, aprendizaje, estados de ánimo y comportamiento, en las respuestas inmunológicas, procesos metabólicos, niveles de hormonas, digestión y muchas más funciones fisiológicas.

The foundation of sleep and wake promotion is laid primarily by the \"fast-acting\" neurotransmitters: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for sleep and glutamate for wake. External to these primary systems are a host of modulatory systems that are characterized by two flip-flop switches of mutually inhibitory neurotransmitter systems that facilitate transitions between wake and sleep as well as non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and REM sleep. Additional mechanisms are in place to help coordinate the sleep-wake states with environmental, metabolic, and behavioral demands. The complexity of the evolutionarily preserved sleep-wake and circadian systems, the proportion of the day dedicated to the natural sleeping period, as well as the neurocognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration caused by deficient sleep highlight the importance of defining, assessing, and optimizing the sleep health of our patients and ourselves. Exciting discoveries continue to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sleep and wake state coordination, reinforcing fundamental healthy practices and paving the way for new interventions that preserve and promote optimal neurologic health."

The aim of this scoping review is to investigate how various physiological signals recorded during sleep or wakefulness relate to objective measures of cognitive or physical performance and subjectively perceived sleep quality to inform conceptual understanding of the elusive, amorphous, and multi-dimensional construct of sleep quality. We also aimed to suggest priorities for future areas of research in sleep quality and performance. We searched six databases ultimately yielding 439 studies after duplicate removal. Sixty-five studies were selected for full review. In general, correlations between objectively measured sleep and objective performance or subjectively assessed sleep quality were weak to moderate. Slow wave sleep was moderately correlated with better performance on tasks of vigilance, motor speed, and executive function as well as better subjective sleep quality and feeling well-rested, suggesting that slow wave sleep may be important for sleep quality and optimal daytime performance. However, these findings were inconsistent across studies. Increased sleep fragmentation was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality in both polysomnographic and actigraphic studies. Studies which simultaneously assessed physiologic sleep measures, performance measures and subjective sleep perception were few, limiting the ability to evaluate correlations between subjective and objective outcomes concurrently in the same individuals. Factors influencing the relationship between sleep quality and performance include circadian variability, sleep inertia, and mismatch between sleep stages studied and outcome measures of choice. Ultimately, the determination of \"quality sleep\" remains largely subjective and inconsistently quantifiable by current measures. Methods evaluating sleep as a continuous measure rather than traditional sleep stages may provide an intriguing approach to future studies of sleep and performance. Future well-designed studies using novel measures of sleep or multimodal ambulatory wearables assessing the three domains of sleep and performance (objective sleep physiology, objective performance, and subjective sleep quality) are needed to better define quality sleep."

Sleep debt, circadian misalignment and sleep disruption from obstructive sleep apnea is widespread in modern society and accumulates with life because recovery sleep is not completely restorative. Accumulated disordered sleep throughout life impacts the ageing process and the development of age-related diseases. When epidemiological and interventional studies are considered collectively, sleep loss and lower sleep duration are associated with lower morning, afternoon and 24-h testosterone; as well as higher afternoon, but not morning or 24-h cortisol. These reciprocal changes imbalances anabolic-catabolic signaling because testosterone and cortisol are respectively the main anabolic and catabolic signals in man. Fixing testosterone-cortisol balance by means of a novel dual-hormone clamp mitigates the induction of insulin resistance by sleep restriction and provided the first proof-of-concept that the metabolic harm from sleep loss can be ameliorated by approaches that do not require sleeping more. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with lower testosterone, even after controlling for age and obesity whereas the conclusion that continuous positive airway pressure therapy has no effect on testosterone is premature because available studies are underpowered and better-quality studies suggest otherwise. High dose testosterone therapy induces OSA, but more physiological dosing may not; and this effect may be transient or may dissipate with longer term therapy. Studies investigating the origin of the diurnal testosterone rhythm, the effect of circadian misalignment on testosterone-cortisol balance, and methods to mitigate metabolic harm, are required."

The gut-brain-axis represents the core rationale setting the stage for a relatively new discipline of study defined as \"nutritional psychiatry\". Research on this matter will help to better understand the relation between food and mood, sleep quality, cognition, and mental health in general."

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were identified via the Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO online databases. Investigations measuring exercise performance under 'control' (i.e., normal sleep, > 6 h in any 24 h period) and 'intervention' (i.e., sleep loss, ≤ 6 h sleep in any 24 h period) conditions were included. Performance tasks were classified into different exercise categories (anaerobic power, speed/power endurance, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), strength, endurance, strength-endurance, and skill). Multi-level random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted, including subgroup analyses to explore the influence of sleep-loss protocol (e.g., deprivation, restriction, early [delayed sleep onset] and late restriction [earlier than normal waking]), time of day the exercise task was performed (AM vs. PM) and body limb strength (upper vs. lower body). Overall, 227 outcome measures (anaerobic power: n = 58; speed/power endurance: n = 32; HIIE: n = 27; strength: n = 66; endurance: n = 22; strength-endurance: n = 9; skill: n = 13) derived from 69 publications were included. Results indicated a negative impact of sleep loss on the percentage change (% Sleep loss appears to have a negative impact on exercise performance. If sleep loss is anticipated and unavoidable, individuals should avoid situations that lead to experiencing deprivation or late restriction, and prioritise morning exercise in an effort to maintain performance."

There are no systematic reviews of the overall maternal outcomes of maternal postpartum depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate both the infant and the maternal consequences of untreated maternal postpartum depression. We searched for studies published between 1 January 2005 and 17 August 2016, using the following databases: MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials registry. A total of 122 studies (out of 3712 references retrieved from bibliographic databases) were included in this systematic review. The results of the studies were synthetized into three categories: (a) the maternal consequences of postpartum depression, including physical health, psychological health, relationship, and risky behaviors; (b) the infant consequences of postpartum depression, including anthropometry, physical health, sleep, and motor, cognitive, language, emotional, social, and behavioral development; and (c) mother-child interactions, including bonding, breastfeeding, and the maternal role. The results suggest that postpartum depression creates an environment that is not conducive to the personal development of mothers or the optimal development of a child. It therefore seems important to detect and treat depression during the postnatal period as early as possible to avoid harmful consequences."

To investigate the associations of type of diet and duration of sleep with the development of T2D. Data derived from the UK Biobank baseline investigation (2006-2010) were analyzed for this cohort study between May 1 and September 30, 2023. The association between sleep duration and healthy dietary patterns with the risk of T2D was investigated during a median (IQR) follow-up of 12.5 (11.8-13.2) years (end of follow-up, September 30, 2021). For the analysis, 247 867 participants were categorized into 4 sleep duration groups: normal (7-8 hours per day), mild short (6 hours per day), moderate short (5 hours per day), and extreme short (3-4 hours per day). Their dietary habits were evaluated based on population-specific consumption of red meat, processed meat, fruits, vegetables, and fish, resulting in a healthy diet score ranging from 0 (unhealthiest) to 5 (healthiest). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the development of T2D across various sleep duration groups and healthy diet scores. The cohort comprised 247 867 participants with a mean [SD] age of 55.9 [8.1] years, of whom 52.3% were female. During the follow-up, 3.2% of participants were diagnosed with T2D based on hospital registry data. Cox regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables, indicated a significant increase in the risk of T2D among participants with 5 hours or less of daily sleep. Individuals sleeping 5 hours per day exhibited a 1.16 adjusted HR (95% CI, 1.05-1.28), and individuals sleeping 3 to 4 hours per day exhibited a 1.41 adjusted HR (95% CI, 1.19-1.68) compared with individuals with normal sleep duration. Furthermore, individuals with the healthiest dietary patterns had a reduced risk of T2D (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.88]). The association between short sleep duration and increased risk of T2D persisted even for individuals following a healthy diet, but there was no multiplicative interaction between sleep duration and healthy diet score. In this cohort study involving UK residents, habitual short sleep duration was associated with increased risk of developing T2D. This association persisted even among participants who maintained a healthy diet. To validate these findings, further longitudinal studies are needed, incorporating repeated measures of sleep (including objective assessments) and dietary habits."

Disruption to the quality, continuity, and timing of sleep can precipitate or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in susceptible individuals, while treatments that target sleep-circadian disturbances can alleviate psychopathology. Conversely, psychiatric symptoms can reciprocally exacerbate poor sleep and disrupt clock-controlled processes. Despite progress in elucidating underlying mechanisms, a cohesive approach that integrates the dynamic interactions between psychiatric disorder with both sleep and circadian processes is lacking. This review synthesizes recent evidence for sleep-circadian dysfunction as a transdiagnostic contributor to a range of psychiatric disorders, with an emphasis on biological mechanisms. We highlight observations from adolescent and young adults, who are at greatest risk of developing mental disorders, and for whom early detection and intervention promise the greatest benefit. In particular, we aim to a) integrate sleep and circadian factors implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood, anxiety, and psychosis spectrum disorders, with a transdiagnostic perspective; b) highlight the need to reframe existing knowledge and adopt an integrated approach which recognizes the interaction between sleep and circadian factors; and c) identify important gaps and opportunities for further research."

The current profiles of sleep habits and disturbances, particularly the differences between workdays and free days, are unknown in the contemporary US. To comprehensively evaluate sleep habits on workdays and free days and the prevalence of sleep disturbances among US adults. This study is a cross-sectional analysis of US nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017-2020) among adults aged 20 years or older. Data analysis was performed from February to May 2022. The main outcomes were means and/or distributions of sleep habits, including sleep duration and sleep-wake timing on workdays and free days, sleep debt (ie, the difference between sleep duration on free days and mean weekly sleep duration), and social jet lag (ie, the difference between the midpoint between sleep and wake time on workdays and free days). Prevalence of trouble sleeping (ie, participants told a doctor or other health professional that they have trouble sleeping) and daytime sleepiness (ie, self-reported feeling of being overly sleepy during the day ≥5 times per month) were also determined. A total of 9004 individuals (mean [SE] age, 48.3 [0.53] years; 4635 women [51.9%]; 3158 non-Hispanic White [62.8%]) were included in the current study. The mean sleep duration was 7.59 hours (95% CI, 7.54 to 7.64 hours) on workdays and 8.24 hours (95% CI, 8.17 to 8.31 hours) on free days (difference, 0.65 hour). The mean sleep and wake times were at 11:02 pm (95% CI, 10:57 pm to 11:17 pm) and 6:41 am (95% CI, 6:36 am to 6:45 am), respectively, on workdays and 11:25 pm (95% CI, 11:21 pm to 11:35 pm) and 7:41 am (95% CI, 7:37 am to 7:46 am), respectively, on free days (differences, 0.23 hour for sleep time and 1.00 hour for wake time). On workdays, 23.1% (95% CI, 21.3% to 24.9%) of adults slept less than 7 hours and 25.4% (95% CI, 24.1% to 26.6%) went to sleep at midnight or later; the corresponding percentages changed to 12.9% (95% CI, 11.6% to 14.1%) and 40.9% (95% CI, 38.4% to 43.5%), respectively, on free days. Furthermore, the mean sleep debt was 0.73 hours (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.77 hours), and mean social jet lag was 1.10 hours (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.15 hours); 30.5% (95% CI, 26.8% to 33.3%) of adults experienced 1 hour or more of sleep debt, and 46.5% (95% CI, 42.6% to 50.3%) experienced 1 hour or more of social jet lag. The prevalence of trouble sleeping was 29.8% (95% CI, 28.2% to 31.5%), and that of daytime sleepiness was 27.2% (95% CI, 25.0% to 29.5%). In 2017 to 2020, US adults showed variability in sleep habits between workdays and free days, with longer sleep duration and later sleep-wake phases on free days, and high percentages of US adults experienced long-term sleep deprivation, chronic social jet lag, and frequent sleep disturbances. These findings provide evidence to further investigate potential approaches to optimize overall US sleep health."

Despite this perceived importance, there are numerous circumstances that can reduce sleep quantity and quality in athletic populations. Because of the effects of sleep loss on various physical, neurophysiological, and cognitive parameters, such perturbations can have consequences for performance and recovery outcomes. Although peer-reviewed literature examining the interaction between sleep, performance, and recovery in athletes is increasing, understanding of these issues remains equivocal. Perhaps most pertinently, the effect of sleep on sport performance does not align with a one-size-fits-all approach and rather depends on numerous factors such as type of sport, scheduling, time of the season, and the intraindividual requirements for sleep. The relationship between brain plasticity and memory, which in turn can influence learning processes and long-term memory consolidation, suggests that sleep may play an important role in learning new skills and tactics for both elite and developing athletes. The aim of this special issue review was to analyze the evidence of sleep loss on sport performance and recovery, with a specific focus on elite athletes. An assessment of these sleep-compromising situations that elite athletes may face during a typical season and practical considerations for alleviating these issues is also provided to further the understanding for medical professionals, scientists, and applied sporting practitioners alike."

Several forms of epilepsy predominantly or exclusively manifest during sleep and seizures tend to arise especially from light NREM sleep. Diagnostic interictal epileptiform discharges on the electroencephalogram are also most likely to be activated during deep NREM sleep stage N3. Epileptiform discharges and antiepileptic medications may in turn detrimentally impact sleep. Co-morbid sleep disorders also have the potential to worsen seizure control.

Access to and use of interactive electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, portable gaming devices) and social media have become deep-rooted elements of adolescents' lives and are associated with poor sleep. Additionally, there is evidence of increases in poor mental health and well-being disorders in adolescents; further linked to poor sleep. This review aimed to summarise the longitudinal and experimental evidence of the impact of device use on adolescents' sleep and subsequent mental health. Nine electronic bibliographical databases were searched for this narrative systematic review in October 2022. Of 5779 identified unique records, 28 studies were selected for inclusion. A total of 26 studies examined the direct link between device use and sleep outcomes, and four reported the indirect link between device use and mental health, with sleep as a mediator. The methodological quality of the studies was generally poor. Results demonstrated that adverse implications of device use (i.e., overuse, problematic use, telepressure, and cyber-victimisation) impacted sleep quality and duration; however, relationships with other types of device use were unclear. A small but consistent body of evidence showed sleep mediates the relationship between device use and mental health and well-being in adolescents. Increasing our understanding of the complexities of device use, sleep, and mental health in adolescents are important contributions to the development of future interventions and guidelines to prevent or increase resilience to cyber-bullying and ensure adequate sleep."

Younger people spend more time on social media than other age groups, and are more likely to be impacted by social media use. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to synthesise the evidence on the associations between social media use, mental health, and sleep of young individuals. Electronic databases PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched using an established methodology and pre-determined search terms for studies that reported the association between social media use, mental health, and sleep. The search yielded 6108 articles, of which 182 (n = 1,169,396) were eligible for the systematic review, and 98 (n = 102,683) could be included in the meta-analyses. The systematic review identified a high level of heterogeneity in the study results. Meta-analyses found small but significant positive associations between social media use, depression, and anxiety. In addition, problematic social media use was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and negatively associated with wellbeing. Geographical location, anxiety measure type, study design, age, and gender were identified as potential moderators. Associations for specific social media platforms as well as some moderator effects were not examined due to an insufficient number of studies. This study provides important evidence of an association between social media use/ problematic social media use, mental health, and sleep. The findings support future longitudinal research to identify the directions and underlying mechanisms of the inter-relationship between these variables."

Previous literature tends to support that SMU is associated with poor sleep and mental health issues in youth, despite some conflicting findings. In this scoping review, we summarized relevant studies published within the past 3 years, highlighted the impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, while also examined the possible underlying mechanisms involved. Future direction and intervention on rational use of SMU was discussed. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies demonstrated the negative impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health, with preliminary evidence indicating potential benefits especially during the COVID period at which social restriction was common. However, the limited longitudinal research has hindered the establishment of directionality and causality in the association among SMU, sleep, and mental health. Recent studies have made advances with a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, which is of public health importance and will contribute to improving sleep and mental health outcomes while promoting rational and beneficial SMU. Future research should include the implementation of cohort studies with representative samples to investigate the directionality and causality of the complex relationships among SMU, sleep, and mental health; the use of validated questionnaires and objective measurements; and the design of randomized controlled interventional trials to reduce overall and problematic SMU that will ultimately enhance sleep and mental health outcomes in youth."

        "abstract": "To develop and present consensus findings of the National Sleep Foundation sleep timing and variability panel regarding the impact of sleep timing variability on health and performance. The National Sleep Foundation assembled a panel of sleep and circadian experts to evaluate the scientific evidence and conduct a formal consensus and voting procedure. A systematic literature review was conducted using the NIH National Library of Medicine PubMed database, and panelists voted on the appropriateness of 3 questions using a modified Delphi RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method with 2 rounds of voting. The literature search and panel review identified 63 full text publications to inform consensus voting. Panelists achieved consensus on each question: (1) is daily regularity in sleep timing important for (a) health or (b) performance? and (2) when sleep is of insufficient duration during the week (or work days), is catch-up sleep on weekends (or non-work days) important for health? Based on the evidence currently available, panelists agreed to an affirmative response to all 3 questions. Consistency of sleep onset and offset timing is important for health, safety, and performance. Nonetheless, when insufficient sleep is obtained during the week/work days, weekend/non-work day catch-up sleep may be beneficial."

We aimed to improve self-reported sleep for patients on a general medicine ward as measured by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) as well as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) question addressing quietness at night. We utilized a non-pharmacologic sleep hygiene bundle composed of a short script with sleep hygiene prompts, such as whether patients would like the shades closed or the lights turned off, as well as a sleep package including an eye mask, earplugs, lavender scent pad, and non-caffeinated tea. Relaxing music was played at bedtime and signs promoting the importance of quietness at night were placed around the unit. Front-line champions were identified to aid with implementation. A total of 931 patients received the intervention. In a sample of surveyed patients, we observed an increase in the RCSQ global score from 6.0 (IQR 3.0-7.0) to 6.2 (IQR 4.0-7.8) from the pre- to post- intervention periods (p = 0.041), as well as increases in three of the five individual survey components. Additionally, HCAHPS \"quietness at night\" score increased on the unit from 34.1% pre-intervention to 42.5% post-intervention. A nonpharmacologic sleep hygiene protocol paired with provider education and use of champions was associated with modest improvements in patients' perceived sleep and unit HCAHPS scores."

We analysed data from 10 212 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2005-2018). Self-report questionnaires were used to collect data on sleep duration, sleepiness, and trouble sleeping, classified into three categories: healthy, intermediate, and poor sleep patterns. Healthy sleep was defined as sleeping seven to nine hours per night with no self-reported sleepiness or trouble sleeping, while intermediate and poor sleep patterns indicated one and two to three sleep problems, respectively. The oxidative balance score (OBS) was calculated based on twenty oxidative stress-related exposures to dietary and lifestyle factors, with a higher score indicating greater antioxidant exposure. Survey-based multivariable-adjusted regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of sleep patterns or OBS alone and combined with the total and specific CVD risk. Participants with poor sleep patterns had a higher likelihood of developing CVD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.45, P < 0.05), while an inverse association was found between OBS and CVD risk (quartile (Q) 4 vs Q1: OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.47-0.94, P = 0.02, P for trend <0.05). There was an interaction between sleep patterns and OBS (P for interaction = 0.03). Participants with unhealthy (intermediate and poor) sleep patterns and pro-oxidant OBS (Q1 and Q2) were significantly associated with increased risk of total CVD (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.42-3.74, P < 0.05), as well as angina and congestive heart failure, but not coronary heart disease (CHD). Stratified analysis showed that among individuals without hyperlipidaemia, participants with both unhealthy sleep patterns and pro-oxidant OBS exhibited a higher risk of CHD compared to those with healthy sleep patterns and antioxidative OBS. Unhealthy sleep patterns and reduced oxidative balance are positively associated with an increased risk of overall and specific CVD. Interventions that target healthy sleep habits and antioxidant-rich diets and lifestyles may be important for reducing the risk of CVD."

        "abstract": "In today's research environment, children's diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors are commonly studied in the context of health, independent of their effect on cognition and learning. Moreover, there is little overlap between the two literatures, although it is reasonable to expect that the lifestyle factors explored in the health-focused research are intertwined with cognition and learning processes. This thematic review provides an overview of knowledge connecting the selected lifestyle factors of diet, physical activity, and sleep hygiene to children's cognition and learning. Research from studies of diet and nutrition, physical activity and fitness, sleep, and broader influences of cultural and socioeconomic factors related to health and learning, were summarized to offer examples of research that integrate lifestyle factors and cognition with learning. The literature review demonstrates that the associations and causal relationships between these factors are vastly understudied. As a result, current knowledge on predictors of optimal cognition and learning is incomplete, and likely lacks understanding of many critical facts and relationships, their interactions, and the nature of their relationships, such as there being mediating or confounding factors that could provide important knowledge to increase the efficacy of learning-focused interventions. This review provides information focused on studies in children. Although basic research in cells or animal studies are available and indicate a number of possible physiological pathways, inclusion of those data would distract from the fact that there is a significant gap in knowledge on lifestyle factors and optimal learning in children. In a climate where childcare and school feeding policies are continuously discussed, this thematic review aims to provide an impulse for discussion and a call for more holistic approaches to support child development."

To examine whether evening screen time is associated with sleep duration and quality that night in youths. This repeated-measures cohort study was performed from March to December 2021 in participant homes in Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants included healthy youths aged 11 to 14.9 years. Data were analyzed from October to November 2023. Objectively measured screen time, captured using wearable or stationary video cameras from 2 hours before bedtime until the first time the youth attempted sleep (shut-eye time) over 4 nonconsecutive nights. Video data were coded using a reliable protocol (κ = 0.92) to quantify device (8 options [eg, smartphone]) and activity (10 options [eg, social media]) type. Sleep duration and quality were measured objectively via wrist-worn accelerometers. The association of screen use with sleep measures was analyzed on a night-by-night basis using mixed-effects regression models including participant as a random effect and adjusted for weekends. Of the 79 participants (47 [59.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 12.9 [1.1] years), all but 1 had screen time before bed. Screen use in the 2 hours before bed had no association with most measures of sleep health that night (eg, mean difference in total sleep time, 0 minutes [95% CI, -3 to 20 minutes] for every 10 minutes more total screen time). All types of screen time were associated with delayed sleep onset but particularly interactive screen use (mean difference, 10 minutes; 95% CI, 4 to 16 minutes for every additional 10 minutes of interactive screen time). Every 10 minutes of additional screen time in bed was associated with shorter total sleep time (mean difference, -3 minutes; 95% CI, -6 to -1 minute). The mean difference in total sleep time was -9 minutes (95% CI, -16 to -2 minutes) for every 10 minutes of interactive screen use and -4 minutes (95% CI, -7 to 0 minutes) for passive screen use. In particular, gaming (mean difference, -17 minutes; 95% CI, -28 to -7 minutes for every 10 minutes of gaming) and multitasking (mean difference, -35 minutes; 95% CI, -67 to -4 minutes on nights with vs without multitasking) were associated with less total sleep time. In this repeated-measures cohort study, use of an objective method showed that screen time once in bed was associated with impairment of sleep, especially when screen time was interactive or involved multitasking. These findings suggest that current sleep hygiene recommendations to restrict all screen time before bed seem neither achievable nor appropriate."

Of 591 eligible study members, 401 completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regression analyses, men who reported poor sleep quality were significantly more likely to have a poor SPPB score, even after adjustment for confounding factors (OR = 2.54, 95% CI 1.10-5.89, P= .03). The direction of the relationship was reversed among women, where those who reported poor sleep were less likely to have a low SPPB score (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.85, P = .02). Poor sleep quality was associated with poorer hand-grip strength among women (regression coefficient = -0.34 z score, 95% CI -0.64, -0.04, P = .03), but this relationship was not observed among men (regression coefficient = 0.28 z score, 95% CI -0.01, 0.57, P = .06).

        "abstract": "Objectives Unhealthy dietary profiles contribute to the elevated risk of chronic diseases for shift workers. There has been limited investigation into factors associated both with shift work and diet, such as sleep and mood, that may further influence food intake among shift workers. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between shift work, sleep, mood, and diet. Methods Shift working nurses [N=52; 46 female; age: mean 39.8 (SD 12.4) years] participated in a 14-day, repeated measures, within- and between-subjects design study. Analyses included data from 40 nurses over 181 shifts. Food diaries were completed for a minimum of three days per shift type (morning, afternoon, night). Foodworks nutrition software was used to determine energy intake in kilojoules and macronutrient intake (as a percentage of total energy intake). Mood (happiness, anxiety, depressive mood, stress, and tiredness) was measured using visual analog scales. Sleep was estimated using actigraphy. Demographic and work-related variables (covariates) were measured using a modified version of the Standard Shiftwork Index. A path analysis was conducted using generalized structural equation modelling with a random effect of participant ID. Predictors were selected using purposive selection of covariates (an alternative to stepwise modelling) and final models included important predictors only. Results Compared to night and morning shifts, results showed that working an afternoon shift was associated with a lower energy intake (β= -1659.4, P<0.01) and lower levels of stress (β= -5.6, P<0.01). Higher levels of stress were associated with a higher energy intake (β=35.3, P<0.01) and a higher percentage of fat (ß=0.1, P=0.05) and saturated fat (β=0.1, P<0.01). Compared to the other shift types, morning shift was associated with lower carbohydrates (β= -4.3, P<0.01) and night shift was associated with lower protein (β= -2.7, P=0.03). Lower sleep efficiency was associated with a higher carbohydrate intake (β= -0.4, P<0.01) and a lower protein intake (β=0.25, P<0.01) Conclusions Results suggest that compared to nights and mornings, afternoon shifts were associated with reduced energy consumption. Negative mood (stress, depression, and anxiety) mediated the association between shift type and energy intake. Negative mood was also associated with higher fat intake. Dietary interventions for shift workers should consider the role of mood as well as shift type."

People are most often at home during dusk and dawn, and light exposure at home - either natural or from electric light - may therefore contribute substantially to sleep and well-being. However, very little research has focused on the effects of home lighting on sleep and well-being, and even less research has investigated the effects of light exposure during twilight. Therefore, a literature study was performed to collect studies on light exposure at home during dusk and dawn. Studies looking at light exposure during dusk and dawn have focused on either electric light intervention (i.e., dusk and dawn simulation) at home or in the laboratory or daylight exposure in the bedroom (i.e., the presence and type of curtains in the bedroom). Most research has focused on dawn simulation during the darker months of the year, often using sunrise alarms. In general, study results pointed to the importance of twilight light exposure at home for sleep and well-being. These results may depend on the characteristics of the user, such as age or chronotype."

However, little is known about whether objectively measured sleep duration and quality influence cognition in midlife, a period of importance for understanding the direction of the association between sleep and dementia. We examined the association between sleep duration and quality, measured when participants were in their mid-30s to late 40s, and midlife cognition assessed 11 years later among Black and White adults. As part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study, sleep duration and quality were assessed objectively using wrist actigraphy and subjectively by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 2003-2005. During 2015-2016, we evaluated midlife cognition using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Stroop test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Letter Fluency and Category Fluency tests. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between sleep parameters and poor cognitive performance, which was defined as a score that was >1 SD below the mean score. The 526 participants (58% women and 44% Black) had a mean age of 40.1 ± 3.6 years at baseline, a mean sleep duration of 6.1 ± 1.1 hours, and mean sleep fragmentation index (calculated as the sum of the percentage of time spent moving and the percentage of immobile periods ≤1 minute) of 19.2 ± 8.1%, and 239 (45.6%) participants reported poor sleep as defined by a PSQI global score of >5. After adjustment for demographics, education, smoking, body mass index, depression, physical activity, hypertension, and diabetes, those in the highest vs lowest tertile of sleep fragmentation index had over twice the odds of having poor cognitive performance (>1 SD below the mean) on the DSST (odds ratio [OR] = 2.97; 95% CI 1.34-6.56), fluency (OR = 2.42; 95% CI 1.17-5.02), and MoCA test (OR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.06-4.94). The association between sleep fragmentation and cognitive performance did not differ by race or sex. Objective sleep duration or subjective sleep quality was not associated with cognition in midlife. Actigraphy-measured high sleep fragmentation rather than sleep duration was associated with worse cognition among middle-aged Black and White men and women. Sleep quality is important for cognitive health even as early as midlife."

In France, a culture of sleeping separately has emerged, and the practice of co-sleeping has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). International recommendations tend to advise against co-sleeping and to devalue it as a practice.Material and methods : Two focus groups with co-sleepers (n=6) complemented by ten in-depth interviews were organized to identify the motivations and organization that mothers and their partners have when it comes to practicing co-sleeping with their children. A content analysis of what was said in the interviews by individuals and couples enabled us to find out more about the needs that co-sleeping responds to, as well as parents' co-sleeping practices.Results : Co-sleeping, made taboo by SIDS, responds to emotional and practical factors. The couple's life does not seem to be negatively impacted by it. The positive relationship it allows parents to have with their children is valued. Recommendations may often describe this way of sleeping as \"unsafe,\" but co-sleepers support this parenting practice, along with breastfeeding.Conclusion : The results highlight the health education importance for co-sleepers. Being educated about co-sleeping will ensure that their practice is safe and will mean that they do not isolate themselves socially to hide it because they only have partial knowledge of the SIDS safety measures."

        "abstract": "Sleep is a modifiable behavior that can be targeted in interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging. This study aims to (i) identify the sleep duration trend in US adults; (ii) investigate the relationship between sleep duration and phenotypic age; and (iii) explore the role of exercise in this relationship. Phenotypic age as a novel index was calculated according to biomarkers collected from US adults based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Sleep information was self-reported by participants and discerned through individual interviews. The principal analytical method employed was weighted multivariable linear regression modeling, which accommodated for the complex multi-stage sampling design. The potential non-linear relationship was explored using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model. Furthermore, subgroup analyses evaluated the potential effects of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors on the primary study outcomes. A total of 13,569 participants were finally included in, thereby resulting in a weighted population of 78,880,615. An examination of the temporal trends in sleep duration revealed a declining proportion of individuals with insufficient and markedly deficient sleep time since the 2015-2016 cycle. Taken normal sleep group as a reference, participants with extreme short sleep [β (95% CI) 0.582 (0.018, 1.146), p = 0.044] and long sleep [β (95% CI) 0.694 (0.186, 1.203), p = 0.010] were both positively associated with phenotypic age using the fully adjusted model. According to the dose-response relationship between sleep duration and phenotypic age, long sleep duration can benefit from regular exercise activity, whereas short sleep duration with more exercise tended to have higher phenotypic age. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between short and long sleep durations and phenotypic age. This study represents an important step forward in our understanding of the complex relationship between sleep and healthy aging. By shedding light on this topic and providing practical exercise recommendations for promoting healthy sleep habits, researchers can help individuals live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives."

Women have a higher prevalence of insomnia disorder and restless legs syndrome (RLS) versus men, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more likely as women age. Hormonal transitions are important to consider in women's sleep. For women, insomnia, OSA, and RLS are predictive of depression, and insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing are predictive of Alzheimer disease. These findings underscore the importance of assessment, treatment, and future research examining sleep and mental health in women, given their unique and increased vulnerability."

Good sleep hygiene behaviours promote sleep quality and are beneficial to overall mental wellbeing. We aimed to examine if sleep hygiene behaviours may mediate the association between health literacy/e-health literacy and mental wellbeing. Adult Iranian subjects (n = 9775; mean [SD] age = 36.44 [11.97] years; 67.3% females) completed the Health Literacy Instrument for Adults, eHealth Literacy Scale, three items on sleep hygiene behaviour that have been used in prior research and the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Data were then subjected to structural equation modelling (SEM) including 500 bootstrapping resampling to examine whether sleep hygiene is a mediator in the relationship between health literacy/e-health literacy and mental wellbeing. Both health literacy and e-health literacy were significantly associated with mental wellbeing (r = .63 for health literacy and .39 for e-health literacy; p < .001) and sleep hygiene behaviours (r = .58 for health literacy and .36 for e-health literacy; p < .001). Sleep hygiene behaviours were significantly associated with mental wellbeing (r = .42; p < .001). Moreover, SEM that incorporated bootstrapping approaches indicated that sleep hygiene behaviours were significant mediators in the association between health literacy/e-health literacy and mental wellbeing. We conclude that health literacy and e-health literacy are associated with mental health wellbeing in the Iranian population. Additionally, the association could be mediated via sleep hygiene behaviours. The study was co-designed with healthcare providers from the vice-Chancellor's Office for Health Affairs of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences as equal partners. Moreover, the women's health volunteers were involved in the design of the study."

A search was conducted for studies related to sleeping rules topics: sleep regularity, regular exercise, alcohol, caffeine, napping, relaxation and meditation, food intake and light exposure. In applying these sleep hygiene principles, it is essential to pay attention to individual variables such as age, genetic predisposition, health status, and substance (caffeine, alcohol) possible dependence."

Curtailed or fragmented sleep may be particularly damaging during adolescence, when sleep disruption by delayed chronotypes and societal pressures coincides with our brains preparing for adult life via intense refinement of neural connectivity. These vulnerabilities converge on the prefrontal cortex, one of the last brain regions to mature and a central hub of the limbic-cortical circuits underpinning decision-making, reward processing, social interactions and emotion. Even subtle disruption of prefrontal cortical development during adolescence may therefore have enduring impact. In this review, we integrate synaptic and circuit mechanisms, glial biology, sleep neurophysiology and epidemiology, to frame a hypothesis highlighting the implications of adolescent sleep disruption for the neural circuitry of the prefrontal cortex. Convergent evidence underscores the importance of acknowledging, quantifying and optimizing adolescent sleep's contributions to normative brain development and to lifelong mental health."

Consequently, the search of sleeping well and sufficiently aims to be happy, healthy, and being productive at work, social and family levels. Therefore, one of the fundamental pillars of health is sleeping an adequate number of hours, follow regular sleep-wake habits and identify sleep disorders. There is a wide variety of sleep disorders that may impact the patient quality of life such as obstructive sleep apnea, chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome. The need to study sleep and its disturbances made the appearance of Sleep Medicine. This is a relatively new discipline that was born in the second half of the twentieth century and aims to promote good sleep hygiene and detect and treat those sleep disorders impairing the subject quality of life. Moreover, the field has expanded to fields such as the evaluation of pediatrics, women, aging, shift work, sports, forensic aspects, and its socioeconomic impact."

Recommended cessation treatment includes offering pharmacotherapy, counseling which should emphasize the rapid risk reduction that occurs after quitting and adequate follow-up contacts. Although most research on cardiovascular disease in relation to tobacco use has focused upon cigarette smoking, we also review available data related to other combustible tobacco products, smokeless tobacco, electronic nicotine delivery systems and second-hand smoke. We discuss the implications of smoking on clinical management of patients with heart disease and newer developments with potential relevance to treatment of such patients."

More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco's effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions. These efforts associated with innovative policy regulations (aimed at reducing nicotine content or eliminating tobacco products) have the potential to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and nicotine use and their enormous adverse impact on population health."

Importantly, recent data by the World Health Organizations (WHO) indicate that in the last two decades global tobacco use has significantly dropped, which was largely driven by decreased numbers of female smokers. Despite such advances, the use of e-cigarettes and waterpipes (shisha, hookah, narghile) is an emerging trend, especially among younger generations. There is growing body of evidence that e-cigarettes are not a harm-free alternative to tobacco cigarettes and there is considerable debate as to whether e-cigarettes are saving smokers or generating new addicts. Here, we provide an updated overview of the impact of tobacco/waterpipe (shisha) smoking and e-cigarette vaping on endothelial function, a biomarker for early, subclinical, atherosclerosis from human and animal studies. Also their emerging adverse effects on the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and the circadian clock are summarized. We briefly discuss heat-not-burn tobacco products and their cardiovascular health effects. We discuss the impact of the toxic constituents of these products on endothelial function and subsequent CVD and we also provide an update on current recommendations, regulation and advertising with focus on the USA and Europe. As outlined by the WHO, tobacco cigarette, waterpipe, and e-cigarette smoking/vaping may contribute to an increased burden of symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to severe health consequences."

There is substantial evidence that adolescent e-cigarette use leads to use of combustible tobacco products. E-cigarette companies commonly advertise that e-cigarettes contain nicotine, flavoring chemicals, and humectants (propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin), but toxicants, ultrafine particles, and carcinogens have also been found in e-cigarette solutions and emissions, many of which are known to cause adverse health effects. Most major e-cigarette brands are owned by big tobacco companies that use similar marketing and advertising strategies to attract youth users as they did with traditional tobacco products. In this review, we provide an overview of e-cigarettes and vape devices with an emphasis on the impact for the pediatric population. We describe the vast array of e-cigarette devices and solutions, concern for nicotine addiction, and the scientific background on the known health harms. There are accompanying visual depictions to assist in identifying these products, including newer e-cigarette products and JUUL. Because current federal regulations are insufficient to protect youth from e-cigarette use, exposure, and nicotine addiction, there are recommendations for pediatricians and pediatric health care providers to counsel and advocate for a tobacco-free lifestyle for patients and families."

HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2α, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence. Research seems to be necessary to assess the frequency of HTP use and its potential negative health effects."

'Poor'-rated studies predominated (23;43%), in particular, for global (4;66%) and AMEA (16;50%). Health outcomes differed between SLT-products and regions; those in AMEA were associated with higher mortality (overall, cancer, Coronary heart disease (CHD), respiratory but not cardiovascular disease (CVD)), and morbidity (CVD, oral and head and neck cancers), with odds ratios up to 38.7. European studies showed no excess mortality (overall, CVD, from cancers) or morbidity (ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, oral, head and neck, pancreatic or colon cancers) from several meta-analyses; single studies reported elevated risk of rectal cancer and respiratory disorders. Pooled study data showed protection against developing Parkinson's disease. US studies showed mixed results for mortality (raised overall, CHD, cancer and smoking-related cancer mortality; no excess risk of respiratory or CVD mortality). Morbidity outcomes were also mixed, with some evidence of increased IHD, stroke and cancer risk (oral, head and neck). No studies reported on switching from cigarettes to SLT-products. Our review demonstrates stark differences between different SLT-products in different regions, ranging from zero harm from European snus to greatly increased health risks in AMEA. The literature on the safety profile for SLT-products for harm reduction is incomplete and potentially misinforming policy and regulation."

Products are attractive to adolescents, with more than 1:10 American adolescents uses them. The use of nicotine and tobacco products by adolescents puts their health at risk and may, in some instances, lead to nicotine addiction. Those providing healthcare for adolescents have an opportunity to provide advice and signpost people to resources to help them stop using such products. There is also a need for legislation to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products."

We highlight how the inclusion of nicotine or flavouring compounds in e-liquids can impact lung toxicity. Finally, we consider the paradox of the safer cigarette: the toxicities of e-cigarettes that can mitigate their potential to serve as a harm reduction tool in the fight against traditional cigarettes, and we summarise the research needed in this underinvestigated area."

However, most COPD smokers do not seem to respond to smoking cessation interventions and may benefit by lessening the negative health effects of long-term cigarette smoke exposure by switching to non-combustible nicotine delivery alternatives, such as heated tobacco products (HTPs) and e-cigarettes (ECs). Compared with conventional cigarettes, HTPs and ECs offer substantial reduction in exposure to toxic chemicals and have the potential to reduce harm from cigarette smoke when used as tobacco cigarette substitutes. In this review, we examine the available clinical studies and population surveys on the respiratory health effects of ECs and HTPs in COPD patients. The current research on the impact of ECs and HTPs on COPD patients' health is limited, and more high-quality studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. However, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the available literature for health professionals looking to advise COPD patients on the use of these products. While ECs and HTPs may offer some benefits in reducing harm from cigarette smoke, their long-term effects on COPD patients' health are still unclear."

        "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration most recently announced its intention to ban menthol cigarettes and cigars nationwide in April 2021. Implementation of the ban will require evidence that it would improve public health. This paper simulates the potential public health impact of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars through its impacts on smoking initiation, smoking cessation and switching to nicotine vaping products (NVPs). After calibrating an established US simulation model to reflect recent use trends in cigarette and NVP use, we extended the model to incorporate menthol and non-menthol cigarette use under a status quo scenario. Applying estimates from a recent expert elicitation on the behavioural impacts of a menthol ban, we developed a menthol ban scenario with the ban starting in 2021. We estimated the public health impact as the difference between smoking and vaping-attributable deaths and life-years lost in the status quo scenario and the menthol ban scenario from 2021 to 2060. As a result of the ban, overall smoking was estimated to decline by 15% as early as 2026 due to menthol smokers quitting both NVP and combustible use or switching to NVPs. These transitions are projected to reduce cumulative smoking and vaping-attributable deaths from 2021 to 2060 by 5% (650 000 in total) and reduce life-years lost by 8.8% (11.3 million). Sensitivity analyses showed appreciable public health benefits across different parameter specifications. Our findings strongly support the implementation of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars."

Although international research on tobacco packaging has been thorough and comprehensive, the risk perception of visual elements in tobacco packaging varies by country, race, and smoking status. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the risk perceptions of visual elements in tobacco packaging among young and middle-aged people in selected cities in China. This study used a questionnaire to construct an index system for visual elements of tobacco packaging and used it to design a related questionnaire. Our group conducted an online questionnaire survey among 296 young people (18-44 years old) in selected cities in China between 16 June and 26 June 2022. The results of the influence of visual elements of tobacco packaging on the perception of tobacco health risks in the youth group were analyzed by SPSS 26.0. A chi-square test analysis yielded differences in the perception of tobacco package color among youths with different smoking status. A linear regression analysis revealed that age group and visual elements were significant, and five groups of visual element comparisons had an effect on the youth group. First, there were differences in the perceptions of tobacco products among participants with different smoking status. Secondly, the more youthful the respondents were, the greater the probability that they were able to identify that the picture fitness warnings had a greater probability of making them conscious of the fitness dangers of smoking ("

Within this time frame, several core tobacco control measures were implemented, the impact of which is outlined within this manuscript. Key successful legislative actions implemented in this time frame led to greater availability of information and further regulation of additives, the banning of mentholated cigarettes, enhanced pictorial package warnings and a regulatory framework for e-cigarettes. While repeated cross-sectional data indicated a 12.5% relative reduction in smoking prevalence after implementation of the TPD, the differential regulation of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco compared with other products, such as cigarillos, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products, may have also led to product displacement. Moreover, as the TPD could not keep up with the ever-changing nicotine product landscape, further adaptations may be needed."

These products include electronic cigarettes, waterpipes/hookah, cigars/cigarillo, smokeless tobacco, and heat-not-burn cigarettes. The observed increase in the use of ETRPs is multifactorial and complex but appears to be mainly driven by efforts from the major tobacco companies to reinvent themselves, and present more appealing and allegedly safe(r) tobacco products. However, it is becoming apparent that these products produce substantial amounts of toxic chemicals, many of which have been shown to exert negative health effects, including in the context of the cardiovascular system. Thus, there has been research efforts, albeit limited in general, to characterize the health impact of these products on occlusive/thrombotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we will discuss the potential impact of ETRPs on thrombosis-based CVD. Specifically, we will review how these products and the major chemicals they produce and/or emit can trigger key players in the process of thrombosis, namely inflammation, oxidative stress, platelets, coagulation, and the vascular endothelium, and the relationship between these effects."

We conducted a structured literature search for empirical studies across three electronic databases through January 10, 2024. Outcomes included ONP product characteristics, use patterns, beliefs and perceptions, toxicity, and marketing and sales. Sixty-two studies were included, 17 were industry-funded. Most studies were from the United States. While large variations across studies were observed in ONP youth prevalence estimates, nationally representative U.S. studies find current use at 1.5% and lifetime use below 2.5% through 2023. Between 35% and 42% of U.S. adolescents and young adults have heard of ONPs, and 9-21% of tobacco-naïve youth were susceptible to trying them. U.S. adult-use estimates varied widely (0.8%-3% current; 3%-16% lifetime use) and were limited to populations with a history of tobacco use. The chemical composition of ONPs suggests fewer harmful/potentially harmful compounds at lower levels than cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (SLT), except formaldehyde. Industry-funded studies find substantially less cytotoxicity compared to cigarettes and suggest that higher nicotine-strength ONPs can deliver nicotine at levels comparable to or higher than SLT or cigarettes, although with slower nicotine release than cigarettes. Evidence on the cytotoxicity of ONPs relative to SLT is mixed. ONPs appear to be less toxic than cigarettes and deliver comparable nicotine, presenting an alternative for combustible product users, although key data are mainly available from industry-funded studies. Data from independent research is critically needed. Industry marketing of ONPs may encourage initiation in youth and situational and dual use in adults. The review provides an initial assessment of the potential role of ONPs in harm reduction and aims to determine unintended consequences of their use (youth uptake and dual-use) and identify populations that disproportionately use the product. This information is essential for tobacco regulatory bodies in determining the net public health impact of nicotine pouches."

This paper presents insights from three research activities from the preparatory phase of the development of a new self-report health and functioning measure. A scoping literature review was conducted to identify the positive and negative impact of TNP use on health and functioning. Focus groups (n = 29) on risk perception and individual interviews (n = 40) on perceived dependence in people who use TNPs were reanalyzed in the context of health and functioning, and expert opinion was gathered from five key opinion leaders and five technical consultants. Triangulating the findings of the review of 97 articles, qualitative input from people who use TNPs, and expert feedback helped generate a preliminary conceptual framework including health and functioning and conceptually-related domains impacted by TNP use. Domains related to the future health and functioning measurement model include physical health signs and symptoms, general physical appearance, functioning (physical, sexual, cognitive, emotional, and social), and general health perceptions. This preliminary conceptual framework can inform future research on development and validation of new measures for assessment of overall health and functioning impact of TNPs from the consumers' perspective."

Products like Juul were not on the market 2 years ago; thus, frequent updates on the topic are essential. Studies have begun to demonstrate that users of the newer pod systems are exposed to high levels of nicotine, as well as other chemicals. These products are highly marketed, with a strong emphasis on how adolescents can use them surreptitiously. This is concerning to researchers, and other studies have continued to demonstrate that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to go on to use combusted tobacco. Further research has also failed to demonstrate that e-cigarettes are useful for people wishing to quit smoking combusted tobacco. E-cigarettes and vaping systems are not safe products and should not be used by adolescents."

To evaluate the effect of applying plain packaging to tobacco products on cardiovascular events and mortality in Argentina, we used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-Argentina, a local adaptation of a well-established computer simulation model that projects cardiovascular and mortality events for the population 35-94 years old using local demographic and consumption data, during the period 2015-2024. After a literature review, we estimated that the implementation of plain packaging of tobacco products would result in an absolute decrease in tobacco prevalence of 0.55% (base-case scenario) and performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a higher and lower decrease of 1.01% and 0.095%, respectively. Over the 2015-2024 period, the decrease in smoking prevalence associated with plain packaging (0.55%) is projected to avert 1880 myocardial infarctions (MI), 820 strokes and 4320 total deaths in Argentina. The higher estimate of smoking prevalence reduction (1.01%) would translate into 3450 fewer MIs, 1490 fewer strokes and 7920 fewer deaths, while the lower estimate of smoking prevalence reduction (0.095%) would result in 330 fewer MIs, 140 fewer strokes and 750 fewer deaths. The implementation of plain packaging of tobacco products could reduce cardiovascular events in Argentina, even in the absence of other tobacco control measures. Actual health benefits are likely higher than those presented here, since plain packaging may be most impactful by preventing young people from initiating smoking."

We summarized the data as themes and codes using the principles of inductive qualitative thematic analysis within structured rational constructivist framework. In total, 13 studies met inclusion criteria were included. Major strategies adopted by tobacco industries to tackle the pricing and taxation changes were increased tax absorption, differential taxation based on price, cigarette length/size which ensures modest increase in the net price of cigarettes. This in turn influences the tobacco users in terms of brand loyalty and switching as they prefer to stay with factory-made cigarettes or shift to a cheaper alternative or illegal product rather than decreasing/quitting tobacco use. Absorption of excise tax and differential taxation are the common pricing strategies adopted by tobacco industries in Global South. These strategies together with external determinants impact the price-related tobacco control interventions."

        "abstract": "The burden of disease attributable to tobacco use in Latin America is very high. Our objective was to evaluate the 10-year potential impact of current legislation related to cigarette packaging and warnings and expected effects of moving to a higher level of strategies implementing cigarette plain packaging on health and cost outcomes in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, using a microsimulation model. We used a probabilistic state-transition microsimulation model, considering natural history, costs, and quality of life losses associated with main tobacco-related diseases. We followed up individuals in hypothetical cohorts and calculated health outcomes annually to obtain aggregated long-term population health outcomes and costs. We performed a literature review to estimate effects and analyzed studies and information from ministries, relevant organizations, and national surveys. We calibrated the model comparing the predicted disease-specific mortality rates with local statistics. Current graphic warnings already in place in each country could avert, during 10 years, 69 369 deaths and 638 295 disease events, adding 1.2 million years of healthy life and saving USD 5.3 billion in the seven countries. If these countries implemented plain packaging strategies, additional 155 857 premature deaths and 4 133 858 events could be averted, adding 4.1 million healthy years of life and saving USD 13.6 billion in direct health care expenses of diseases attributable to smoking. Latin American countries should not delay the implementation of this strategy that will alleviate part of the enormous health and financial burden that tobacco poses on their economies and health care systems. Tobacco smoking is the single most preventable and premature mortality cause in the world. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, supported by the World Health Organization, introduced a package of evidence-based measures for tobacco control. This study adds evidence on the potential health effects and savings of implementing cigarette plain packaging in countries representing almost 80% of the Latin American population; findings are valuable resources for policy makers in the region."

        "abstract": "There is some evidence that paternal health behaviours during and around pregnancy could be associated with offspring health outcomes. However, the impact that paternal health behaviours during pregnancy can have on offspring mental health is understudied and remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in PubMed describing studies of potentially modifiable paternal health behaviours (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption and physical activity) in the prenatal period in relation to offspring mental health. GRADE was used to measure risk of bias. Eight studies were included and categorized by paternal health behaviour and offspring mental health outcome investigated. The narrative synthesis provided evidence of association between paternal health behaviours around pregnancy and offspring mental health problems, with the strongest evidence shown for tobacco use. Grouped by analysis type, two separate meta-analyses showed evidence of paternal smoking during pregnancy being associated with greater odds of ADHD in offspring (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.99; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39). The small number of studies that have investigated paternal prenatal effects on offspring mental health, and the limited sample sizes of those studies, makes it challenging to draw firm conclusions. Although existing studies suggest that paternal tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption in the prenatal period are associated with poorer offspring mental health, (particularly hyperactivity/ADHD), further investigation of potential paternal effects is required, using methods that allow stronger inference to determine whether associations are causal. More research has focused on the impact mothers’ behaviours (such as smoking or alcohol use) during and around pregnancy may have on their children’s health, with less research investigating the role paternal health behaviours may play.This review captured what research was currently available that investigated the impact of paternal alcohol, tobacco, caffeine use, and physical activity during pregnancy on children’s mental health.We showed that this area is currently under researched, finding only eight studies. However, of the research that was already published we found evidence of paternal health behaviours having an impact on children’s mental health. The strongest evidence was shown for paternal smoking during pregnancy having a negative impact on children’s hyperactivity/ADHD. No studies measured paternal caffeine use or physical activity around pregnancy. This review highlights the lack of research that has investigated the association between paternal modifiable health behaviours around pregnancy and offspring mental health. Despite including four different types of paternal health behaviours and a broad definition of offspring mental health across any age, only eight studies were shown. This review suggests further research within this area is needed which may influence health warnings to potential fathers to be both before conception and during pregnancy."

Various United Nations agencies share interests in mitigating the environmental costs of tobacco. Since 2000, transnational tobacco industry consolidation has accelerated, spotlighting the specific companies responsible for the environmental and human harms along the tobacco production chain. Simultaneously, corporate social responsibility norms have led the industry to disclose statistics on the environmental harms their business causes. Yet, independent and consistent reporting remain hurdles to accurately assessing tobacco's environmental impact. This article is the first to analyze publicly available industry data on tobacco manufacturing pollution. Tobacco's significant environmental impact suggests this industry should be included in environmental analyses as a driver of environmental degradation influencing climate change. Countries aiming to meet UN Sustainable Development Goals must act to reduce environmental harms caused by the tobacco industry."

To evaluate the potential differential effects of alternative tobacco products on lung inflammatory responses and efficacy of vaccination in comparison to CC. Mice were exposed to emissions from EC, HTP, CC, or air for 8 weeks. BAL and lung tissue were analyzed for markers of inflammation, lung damage, and oxidative stress. Another group was exposed for 12 weeks and vaccinated and challenged with a bacterial respiratory infection. Antibody titers in BAL and sera and pulmonary bacterial clearance were assessed. EC- and HTP-aerosols significantly augmented lung immune cell infiltrates equivalent to that achieved following CC-exposure. HTP and CC significantly increased neutrophil numbers compared to EC. All products augmented numbers of B cells, T cells, and pro-inflammatory IL17A HTP and EC-aerosols induced a proinflammatory pulmonary microenvironment, lung damage, and suppressed efficacy of vaccination."

Between 2010 and mid-2019, ten states and two large counties adopted ENDS taxes. We use two large national surveys (Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System) to estimate the impact of ENDS taxes on youth tobacco use. We find that ENDS taxes reduce youth ENDS consumption, with estimated ENDS tax elasticities of -0.06 to -0.21. However, we estimate sizable positive cigarette cross-tax effects, suggesting economic substitution between cigarettes and ENDS for youth. These substitution effects are particularly large for frequent cigarette smoking. We conclude that the unintended effects of ENDS taxation may considerably undercut or even outweigh any public health gains."

Evidence suggests that increasing the excise tax of tobacco products is a consistently effective tool for reducing tobacco use and is an efficient mechanism for increasing government revenues. However, less research has been conducted in low/middle-income countries where other tobacco forms are common. This paper presents insights from our work on the economics of waterpipe tobacco smoking conducted in the Eastern Mediterranean Region where waterpipe smoking originated and is highly prevalent. The specific areas related to economics of waterpipe smoking considered herein are: price elasticity, taxation, government revenue, expenditure and healthcare costs. This paper aims to provide practical guidance for researchers investigating the economics of waterpipe tobacco with potential implications for other novel tobacco products. We present lessons learnt across five thematic areas: data, demand, taxes, equity and health modelling. We also highlight knowledge gaps to be addressed in future research. Research implications include designing comprehensive assessment tools that investigate heterogeneity in waterpipe smoking patterns; accounting for cross-price elasticity of demand with other tobacco products; exploring the change in waterpipe tobacco smoking in response to a tax increase and analysing the equity impact of waterpipe tobacco control interventions."

We extend linear regression models by controlling both the serial correlation and endogeneity bias problems. We also observe the properties in the ARMA(2,2) data generating process. We document that tobacco tends to affect the USA's future economy but not Indonesia. In our robustness check, we conduct a SUR analysis to control the contemporaneous correlations among Asian markets. We further document that tobacco variables tend not to affect the economy in the Asian markets. Our results show that the contribution of tobacco commodity to the economy is overstated.

We adapted an existing multistate life table model, using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and other data inputs, including diseases contributing >5% of the GBD estimated disability-adjusted life years lost in the Solomon Islands in 2016. Tax effects used price increases and price elasticities to change cigarette smoking prevalence. The TFG was modelled by no uptake of smoking among those 20 years and under after 2016. Under business as usual (BAU) smoking prevalence decreased over time, and decreased faster under the tax intervention (especially for younger ages). For example, for 20-year-old males the best estimated prevalence in 2036 was 22.9% under BAU, reducing to 14.2% under increased tax. Eradicating tobacco in 2016 would achieve 1510 undiscounted HALYs per 1000 people alive in 2016, over the remainder of their lives. The tax intervention would achieve 370 HALYs per 1000 (24.5% of potential health gain), and the TFG 798 HALYs per 1000 people (52.5%). By time horizon, 10.5% of the HALY gains from tax and 8.0% from TFG occur from 2016 to 2036, and the remainder at least 20 years into the future. This study quantified the potential of two tobacco control policies over maximum health gains achievable through tobacco eradication in the Solomon Islands."

Health warning labels (HWLs) can inform the adverse effects associated with smoking. Thus, their application to waterpipe offers a favourable policy to limit WTS epidemic. This study assessed the effectiveness of pictorial HWLs and their placements on waterpipe parts (device, tobacco and charcoal package) on several communication outcomes. We conducted a randomised cross-over experimental study among 276 waterpipe smokers (aged 18-34) between 13 and 26 August 2021. Participants observed three conditions: pictorial HWLs on tobacco packages, pictorial HWLs on three parts of the waterpipe (device, tobacco and charcoal package) and text only on tobacco package in random order. Participants completed baseline and postexposure assessments evaluating HWL effectiveness on attention, reaction, attitudes and beliefs, perceived effectiveness of HWLs and intention to quit WTS. Planned comparisons using Friedman test followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test for multiple comparisons were conducted. Compared with text only, pictorial HWLs elicited greater attention (p=0.011), higher cognitive elaboration (p=0.021), perceived message effectiveness (p=0.007), negative affect reactions (p<0.01) and greater psychological reactance (p=0.01). No significant differences were found for most communication outcomes between pictorial HWLs on three parts of the waterpipe compared with tobacco package only. Pictorial HWLs on tobacco package were superior to text only for several communication outcomes. These findings provide strong evidence for potential implementation of pictorial HWLs on waterpipe tobacco packages to increase smokers' awareness of the health effects of WTS and correct false safety perceptions."

There is a lack of evidence in Albania, as well as in most of Eastern Europe and middle-income countries, regarding the effect of price on smoking experimentation. The study aims to assess the effect of price and tobacco control policies on youth smoking experimentation in Albania. We used microdata from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey in Albania for 2004, 2009, 2015 and 2020. We constructed a pseudo-longitudinal dataset and estimated a split-population model to assess the hazard of smoking experimentation. Price is a significant predictor of smoking experimentation among teenagers in Albania for both males and females (p<0.001). Being male increases the odds for smoking experimentation by more than 50% as compared with females (p<0.001), whereas females appear to be more price sensitive. Peer and parent smoking are also important determinants for smoking experimentation. Introducing penalties for smokers and legal entities violating smoke-free policies implemented in 2014 is also associated with a lower hazard of smoking experimentation. Price is a significant predictor of smoking experimentation among teenagers in Albania for both males and females. A combination of increasing taxes and strengthening the rule of law to control tobacco use in public spaces, in addition to public awareness campaigns targeting both youth and smoking parents, could help to significantly reduce the probability of smoking experimentation."

Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from nationally representative Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys (1999-2000; 2004-2005 and 2011-2012). Outcomes were: any bidi/cigarette consumption in the household and monthly consumption of bidi/cigarette sticks per person. A difference-in-differences two-part model was used to compare changes in bidi/cigarette consumption between NTCP intervention and control districts, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and time-based heterogeneity. There was an overall decline in household-reported bidi and cigarette consumption between 1999-2000 and 2011-2012. However, compared with control districts, NTCP districts had no significantly different reductions in the proportions of households reporting bidi (adjusted OR (AOR): 1.03, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.28) or cigarette (AOR: 1.01 to 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.26) consumption, or for the monthly per person consumption of bidi (adjusted coefficient: 0.07, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.28) or cigarette (adjusted coefficient: -0.002, 95% CI: -0.26 to 0.26) sticks among bidi/cigarette consuming households. Our findings indicate that early implementation of the NTCP may not have produced reductions in tobacco use reflecting generally poor performance against the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control objectives in India. This study highlights the importance of strengthening the implementation and enforcement of tobacco control policies in LMICs to achieve national and international child health and premature NCD mortality reduction targets."

This review focused on systematically identifying and synthesizing evidence of longitudinal studies that evaluate different GHW formats and specifically considered GHW influence on perceived risk of tobacco use and quit intentions. Ten databases were systematically searched for relevant records in December 2017 and again in September 2019. Thirty-five longitudinal studies were identified and analyzed in terms of the formatting of GHWs and the outcomes of perceived risk and quit intentions. Quality assessment of all studies was conducted. This review found graphics exceeding 50% of packs were the most common ratio for GHWs, and identified an ongoing reliance on negatively framed messages and limited source attribution. Perceived harms and quit intentions were increased by GHWs. However, wear-out effects were observed regardless of GHW format indicating the length of time warnings are present in market warrants ongoing research attention to identify wear out points. Quit intentions and perceived harm were also combined into a cognitive response measure, limiting the evaluation of the effects of each GHW format variables in those cases. In addition, alternative GHW package inserts were found to be a complimentary approach to traditional GHWs. This review demonstrated the role of GHWs on increasing quit intentions and perceptions of health risks by evaluating quality-assessed longitudinal research designs. The findings of this study recommend testing alternate GHW formats that communicate quit benefits and objective methodologies to extend beyond self-report."

This is concerning since 300 million individuals around the globe are users of smokeless tobacco. Significant evidence has shown that microbial metabolic activities mediate the formation of carcinogens during manufacturing. In recent years, studies have revealed a series of additional health impacts that include lesions and inflammation of the oral mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as alterations of the endogenous microbiota. These findings are due to recent developments in molecular technologies that allowed researchers to better examine the microbial component of these products. This new information illustrates the scale of the STP microbiota and its diversity in the finished product that is sold for consumption. Additionally, the application of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics has provided the tools to look at phylogenies across bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic groups, their functional capacities, and viability. Here we present key examples of tobacco microbiology research that utilizes newer approaches and strategies to define the microbial component of smokeless tobacco products. We also highlight challenges in these approaches, the knowledge gaps being filled, and those gaps that warrant further study. A better understanding of the microbiology of STP brings vast public health benefits. It will provide important information for the product consumer, impact manufacturing practices, and provide support for the development of attainable and more meaningful regulatory goals. KEY POINTS: Newer technologies allowed quicker and more comprehensive identification of microbes in tobacco samples, encapsulating microorganisms difficult or impossible to culture. Current research in smokeless tobacco microbiology is filling knowledge gaps previously unfilled due to the lack of suitable approaches. The microbial ecology of smokeless tobacco presents a clearer picture of diversity and variability not considered before."

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoke contains highly reactive free radicals thought to play an important role in tobacco smoke-induced harm. Previously, large variations in free radical and toxicant output have been observed in commercial cigarettes. These variations are likely because of cigarette design features (paper, filter, and additives), tobacco variety (burley, bright, oriental, etc.), and tobacco curing methods (air, sun, flue, and fire). Previous reports show that tobacco varieties and curing methods influence the production of tobacco smoke constituents like the tobacco-specific carcinogen nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). We evaluated free radical, nicotine, and NNK production in cigarette smoke from cigarettes produced with 15 different types of tobacco. Gas-phase free radicals were captured by spin trapping with N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and particulate-phase radicals were captured on a Cambridge Filter pad (CFP). Both types of radicals were analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nicotine and NNK were extracted from the CFP and analyzed by gas chromatography flame ionization detection and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Gas-phase radicals varied nearly 8-fold among tobacco types with Saint James Perique tobacco producing the highest levels (42 ± 7 nmol/g) and Canadian Virginia tobacco-producing the lowest levels (5 ± 2 nmol/g). Nicotine and NNK levels in smoke varied 14-fold and 192-fold, respectively, by type. Gas-phase free radicals were highly correlated with NNK levels (r = 0.92, p < .0001) and appeared to be most impacted by tobacco curing method. Altogether, these data suggest that tobacco types used in cigarette production may serve as a target for regulation to reduce harm from cigarette smoking. Variations in cigarette free radical and NNK levels vary based on the tobacco variety and curing method. Reducing the ratio of high-producing free radical and NNK tobacco types offer a potential tool for regulators and producers looking to reduce toxicant output from cigarettes."

This review was based on many sources mainly: International Legal Consortium, International Tobacco Control, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, FCTC, expert group visits and published literature. The FCTC provided a framework that applies to all forms of tobacco and this encouraged some parties to adopt control measures against NCTP and to incorporate them into their national tobacco control plans. Although a number of countries have adopted measures specifically targeted towards smokeless and waterpipe tobacco, greater global progress is needed. The strongest achievements have been in protection from exposure to tobacco smoke; controlling advertising, promotion and sponsorship; controlling sales to and by minors; education, communication and public awareness; and packaging and labelling of NCTP. Countries which adopted broad definitions of tobacco products have demonstrated encouraging trends in curbing their use. Future work should address the deep-rooted social acceptance of NCTP, the laxity in their control, their exclusion from regulations in some countries and the failure to subject them to increased taxation. Control measures should also specifically target the initiation risk to youth and adolescents and all factors that contribute to that such as banning flavourings and promotions through social media. Stronger global surveillance of NCTP use, tracking of policy implementation and evaluation of policy impact will provide important evidence to assist parties in fully implementing the FCTC to control their use."

This commentary aims to highlight research gaps, particularly in toxicity research, and provide guidance on priority research questions for the tobacco regulatory community. Disposable flavoured ENDS have become the most popular device class among youth and may contain higher nicotine levels than JUUL devices. They also exhibit enhanced harmful and potentially harmful constituents production, contain elevated levels of synthetic coolants and pose environmental concerns. Synthetic nicotine and flavour capsules are innovations that have recently enabled the circumvention of Food and Drug Administration oversight. Coil-less ENDS offer the promise of delivering fewer toxicants due to the absence of heating coils, but initial studies show that these products exhibit similar toxicological profiles compared with JUULs. Each of these topic areas requires further research to understand and mitigate their impact on human health, especially their risks to young users."

        "abstract": "Despite the quantum of research findings on tobacco epidemic, a review on the formation characteristics of nicotine, aldehydes and phenols, and their associated etiological risks is still limited in literature. Accordingly, knowledge on the chemical properties and free radical formation during tobacco burning is an important subject towards unravelling the relationship between smoking behaviour and disease. This review investigates how scientific efforts have been advanced towards understanding the release of molecular products from the thermal degradation of tobacco, and harm reduction strategies among cigarette smokers in general. The mechanistic characteristics of nicotine and selected aldehydes are critically examined in this review. For the purpose of this work, articles published during the period 2004-2021 and archived in PubMed, Google Scholar, Medley, Cochrane, and Web of Science were used. The articles were selected based on the health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco burning kinetics, tobacco cessation and tobacco as a precursor for emerging diseases such as Covid-19. The toxicity of cigarette smoke is directly correlated with its chemical composition derived from the pyrolysis of tobacco stem and leaves. Most of the harmful toxic substances are generated by pyrolysis during smoking and depends on pyrolysis conditions. Detailed studies have been conducted on the kinetics of nicotine by use of robust theoretical models in order to determine the rate constants of reactions in nicotine and those of nicotine dissociation via C-C and C-N scission, yielding pyridinyl and methyl radicals, respectively. Research has suggested that acetaldehyde enhances the effect of nicotine, which in turn reinforces addiction characteristics whereas acrolein and crotonaldehyde are ciliatoxic, and can inhibit lung clearance. On the other hand, phenol affects liver enzymes, lungs, kidneys, and the cardiovascular system while The characteristics of chemical release during tobacco burning are very important in the tobacco industry and the cigarette smoking community. Understanding individual chemical formation from cigarette smoking will provide the necessary information needed to formulate sound tobacco reform policies from a chemical standpoint. Nonetheless, intense research is needed in this field in order to prescribe possible measures to deter cigarette smoking addiction and ameliorate the grave miseries bedevilling the tobacco smoking community."

This study used concept mapping, a mixed-method participatory approach, to identify impacts of COVID-19 on cigarette smokers. Cigarette smokers across the United States (U.S.) were recruited to complete this online, multi-step study. Of the 126 participants who were invited to participate in this study, 91 participants (mean age = 40.9; SD = 11.3) completed at least one of the three study tasks (i.e., brainstorming, sorting, and rating). Participants completed a brief demographic survey and brainstormed statements that completed a focus prompt: \"A specific way that Coronavirus/COVID-19 has impacted/affected my cigarette use, smoking behaviors, tobacco purchasing behaviors, and/or other tobacco-related behaviors is.\" After duplicate statements were removed, participants sorted the final list of 87 statements by similarity of content and rated how true statements were from them (1-Definitely NOT true to 7-Definitely true). Nine thematic clusters were identified: Smoking More, Smoking to Cope/Reduce Stress, Change in Smoking Behaviors Due to COVID-19, Concerns about Smoking and COVID-19 Risk, Social Impacts, Maintaining and Rationing Cigarette Supply, Impacts on Obtaining Cigarettes, Use of Other Tobacco Products/Drugs, and Minimal/No Impacts/Concerns of COVID-19. The highest rated cluster (i.e., most true) was the Smoking More cluster followed by the Concerns about Smoking and COVID-19 Risk cluster. The highest rated statement in the study was the statement \"Smoking keeps me calm\". Cigarette smokers may endure additional impacts of COVID-19, such as increased COVID-19 health burdens, stressors related to risk of exposure, social stigma and isolation, financial burdens, and increased toxicant exposure from increased smoking frequency."

Researchers have been tirelessly developing suitable techniques to assess these products' emissions, toxicity, and public health impact. The nonclinical testing of tobacco products to assess the chemical profile of emissions is needed for evidence-based regulations. This testing has largely relied on targeted analytical methods that focus on constituent lists that may fall short in determining the toxicity of newly designed tobacco products. Nontargeted analysis (NTA), or the process of identifying and quantifying compounds within a complex matrix without prior knowledge of its chemical composition, is a promising technique for tobacco regulation, but it is not without challenges. The lack of standardized methods for sample generation, sample preparation, chromatographic separation, compound identification, and data analysis and reporting must be addressed so that the quality and reproducibility of the data generated by NTA can be benchmarked. This review discusses the challenges and highlights the opportunities of NTA in studying tobacco product constituents and emissions."

Data on prices, tax rates and tax revenue are used to estimate a benchmark scenario prior to the GST implementation in 2017-2018. Using own-price elasticity of demand for tobacco products, we estimate the impact of GST at the state level and the aggregate state-wise impact to obtain the national level impact. We predict that the statutory GST rate of 28% plus compensation cess will increase the price of cigarettes, The GST has increased the complexity of the tax system for tobacco products. In particular, for cigarettes, the specific cess constitutes the majority of tax revenue, and therefore, it must be revised regularly to protect revenue and keep real prices from falling. In addition, India should reintroduce excise taxation on all tobacco products, at least in part, on top of the GST, to make them less affordable and to smooth the transition after the expiration of the compensation cess."

An estimated 15.4% of all deaths in the world are attributable to tobacco smoking. The present review aims to describe addiction to tobacco smoking and vaping. Tobacco and vaping devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug, which explains why smoking is so prevalent and persistent. Electronic cigarettes are a group of novel nicotine or tobacco products that have rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Electronic cigarette devices allow for the use of other drugs, including THC, while the lax regulation may allow for the introduction of toxic compounds that can lead to acute or subacute toxicity, such as the e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury that has been linked to vitamin E acetate. In addition, regular vapers and heated tobacco devices emit toxins, although at lower concentrations than burned tobacco. However, more and more side effects have been identified. No new effective treatment for nicotine addiction has been developed recently, despite its huge adverse impact on overall health and other outcomes. As for the primary line of medications, the last one started in 2006, the varenicline, demonstrating a low interest in developing new medications against smoking, an unacceptable state of affairs, given the huge impact of smoking on morbidity and mortality."

E-cigarettes are sometimes regarded as a less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking, and there is some evidence of their potential role as a smoking cessation aid. However, there are concerns about their health consequences, particularly in users who are not tobacco smokers, and also when used long term. Given the mode of delivery of these products, there is potential for oral health consequences. Over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of studies conducted to explore their oral health effects. In vitro studies have reported a range of cellular effects, but these are much less pronounced than those resulting from exposure to tobacco smoke. Microbiological studies have indicated that e-cigarette users have a distinct microbiome, and there is some indication this may be more pathogenic compared to nonusers. Evidence of oral health effects from clinical trials is still limited, and most studies to date have been small in scale and usually cross-sectional in design. Epidemiological studies highlight concerns over oral dryness, irritation, and gingival diseases. Interpreting data from e-cigarette studies is challenging, given the different populations that have been investigated and the continual emergence of new products. Overall, studies reveal potential oral health harms, underscoring the importance of efforts to reduce use in nonsmokers. However, in smokers who are using e-cigarettes as an aid to help them quit, the benefits of quitting tobacco smoking may outweigh any negative oral health impacts of e-cigarette use, particularly in the short term. Future research is needed to understand the clinical significance of some of the biological changes observed by following different cohorts of users longitudinally in carefully designed clinical studies and pragmatic trials supported by high-quality in vitro studies."

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were screened for literature. Eligibility criteria included clinical studies published between 2006 and 2022 that compare e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes on periodontal health (bleeding on probing (BoP), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL), marginal bone loss (MBL), tooth loss, molecular inflammation markers, salivary flow rate). Meta-regression analysis was used to examine the influence of moderator variables. Sixteen studies were found to be eligible for qualitative synthesis. Individual analyses showed that cigarette smokers had significantly higher PI, PD, AL, and MBL and increased concentrations of proinflammatory mediators than e-cigarette users and non-smokers. Meta-analysis revealed a 0.33-fold lower chance for BoP in e-cigarette users compared to smokers (p = 0.03), whereby meta-regression failed to detect any effects regarding the age of users and frequency of smoking. A 0.01-fold decreased chance for positive BoP in e-cigarette users compared with non-smokers was seen (p < 0.01). The current findings suggest that that e-cigarette use might be considered a healthier alternative to cigarette smoking concerning periodontal health. Even so, harmful effects of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) usage on periodontal health were seen as well. However, a definitive decision on this research question remains elusive due to the absence of randomized controlled trials. Electronic cigarettes, marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, are becoming increasingly popular. Evidence on the use of electronic cigarettes as a cessation aid and its beneficial impact compared to cigarette smoke remains inconclusive, so the analysis conducted in this review addresses a recent question of high clinical relevance."

HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2α, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence. Research seems to be necessary to assess the frequency of HTP use and its potential negative health effects."

We analyzed data from 7059 participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) diagnosed with an initial primary lung cancer (IPLC) between 1993 and 2017.

We conducted validation studies using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (N = 3423 IPLC cases) and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (N = 4731 IPLC cases) cohorts and pooled the SPLC risk estimates using random effects meta-analysis. Overall, 163 MEC cases (2.3%) developed SPLC. Smoking pack-years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18 per 10 pack-years, p < 0.001) and smoking intensity (HR = 1.30 per 10 cigarettes per day, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased SPLC risk. Individuals who met the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's screening criteria at IPLC diagnosis also had an increased SPLC risk (HR = 1.92; p < 0.001). Validation studies with the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition revealed consistent results. Meta-analysis yielded pooled HRs of 1.16 per 10 pack-years (p Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for SPLC. Smoking cessation may reduce the risk of SPLC. Additional strategies for SPLC surveillance and screening are warranted."

We assessed the acute effects of TC, EC and sham smoking on blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nervous system. Methods: We studied 12 normotensive male habitual smokers (mean age 33 years) free of cardiovascular disease. The study design was randomized and sham controlled with three experimental sessions (sham smoking, TC smoking and EC smoking). After baseline measurements at rest, the subjects were then asked to smoke (puffing habits left uncontrolled) two TC cigarettes containing 1.1 mg nicotine, EC smoking or simulated smoking with a drinking straw with a filter (sham smoking), in line with previous methodology. Results: EC smoking at 5 and 30 min compared to baseline was accompanied by the augmentation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (p < 0.001 for all). The muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) decrease was significant during both TC and EC sessions (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and was similar between them (−25.1% ± 9.8% vs. −34.4% ± 8.3%, respectively, p = 0.018). Both MSNA decreases were significantly higher (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) than that elicited by sham smoking (−4.4% ± 4.8%). Skin sympathetic nerve activity increase was significant in both TC and EC groups (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and similar between them (73.4% ± 17.9% and 71.9% ± 7%, respectively, p = 0.829). Conclusions: The unfavorable responses of sympathetic and arterial pressure to EC smoking are similar to those elicited by TC in healthy habitual smokers."

        "abstract": "A good old gateway theory that electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are widely recognized as safer tobacco substitutes. In actuality, demographics also show that vaping cannibalizes smoking, the best explanation of the data is the \"common liability\". However, the utilization of e-cigarette products remains a controversial topic at present. Currently, there has been a widespread and substantial growth in e-cigarette use worldwide owing to their endless new flavors and customizable characteristics. Furthermore, e-cigarette has grown widespread among smokers as well as non-smokers, including adolescents and young adults. And some studies have shown that e-cigarette users are at greater risk to start using combustible cigarettes while e-cigarettes use was also observed the potential benefits to people who want to quit smoking or not. Although it is true that e-cigarettes generally contain fewer toxic substances than combustible cigarettes, this does not mean that the chemical composition in e-cigarettes aerosols poses absolutely no risks. While concerns about toxic substances in e-cigarettes and their widespread use in the population are reasonable, it is also crucial to consider that e-cigarettes have been associated with the potential for promoting smoking cessation and the clinically relevant improvements in users with smoking-related pathologies. Meanwhile, there is still short of understanding of the health impacts associated with e-cigarette use. Therefore, in this review, we discussed the health impacts of e-cigarette exposure on oral, nasal, pulmonary, cardiovascular systems and brain. We aspire for this review to change people's previous perceptions of e-cigarettes and provide them with a more balanced perspective. Additionally, we suggest appropriate adjustments on regulation and policy for e-cigarette to gain greater public health benefits."

While electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been advocated as harm reduction alternatives to tobacco products, recent studies have revealed potential detrimental effects, highlighting the urgent need for further research into the molecular and health impacts of e-cigarettes. Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to dissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or e-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, cervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and indirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci [cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG)] clustered into four functional groups, including detoxification or growth signaling, based on cell type and anatomic site. Loci hypermethylated in buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with NOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor receptor signaling also exhibited elevated methylation in cancer tissue and progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and hypermethylation of these sites predicted lung cancer development in buccal samples collected from smokers up to 22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a potential role in driving carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also hypermethylated in e-cigarette users with a limited smoking history. This study sheds light on the cell type-specific changes to the epigenetic landscape induced by smoking-related products. The use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes elicits cell- and exposure-specific epigenetic effects that are predictive of carcinogenesis, suggesting caution when broadly recommending e-cigarettes as aids for smoking cessation."

Meta-analysis of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) studies indicate 13% lower pooled, adjusted relative risks of cardiovascular events with every 1% improvement in FMD. This study sought to determine the early vascular impact of switching from TC to EC in chronic smokers. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized control trial with a parallel nonrandomized preference cohort and blinded endpoint of smokers ≥18 years of age who had smoked ≥15 cigarettes/day for ≥2 years and were free from established cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomized to EC with nicotine or EC without nicotine for 1 month. Those unwilling to quit continued with TC in a parallel preference arm. A propensity score analysis was done to adjust for differences between the randomized and preference arms. Vascular function was assessed by FMD and pulse wave velocity. Compliance with EC was measured by carbon monoxide levels. Within 1 month of switching from TC to EC, there was a significant improvement in endothelial function (linear trend β = 0.73%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41 to 1.05; p < 0.0001; TC vs. EC combined: 1.49%; 95% CI: 0.93 to 2.04; p < 0.0001) and vascular stiffness (-0.529 m/s; 95% CI: -0.946 to -0.112; p = 0.014). Females benefited from switching more than males did in every between-group comparison. Those who complied best with EC switch demonstrated the largest improvement. There was no difference in vascular effects between EC with and without nicotine within the study timeframe. TC smokers, particularly females, demonstrate significant improvement in vascular health within 1 month of switching from TC to EC. Switching from TC to EC may be considered a harms reduction measure. (Vascular Effects of Regular Cigarettes Versus Electronic Cigarette Use [VESUVIUS]; NCT02878421; ISRCTN59133298)."

The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize what is known about the impact of smoking and smoking cessation on disease-specific outcomes for seven common neurological disorders. We included 67 studies on the association of smoking and smoking cessation on disease-specific outcomes. For multiple sclerosis, smoking was associated with greater clinical and radiological disease progression, relapses, risk for disease-related death, cognitive decline, and mood symptoms, in addition to reduced treatment effectiveness. For stroke and transient ischemic attack, smoking was associated with greater rates of stroke recurrence, post-stroke cardiovascular outcomes, post-stroke mortality, post-stroke cognitive impairment, and functional impairment. In patients with cognitive impairment and dementia, smoking was associated with faster cognitive decline, and smoking was also associated with greater cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, but not motor symptom worsening. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who smoked faced increased mortality. Last, in patients with cluster headache, smoking was associated with more frequent and longer cluster attack periods. Conversely, for multiple sclerosis and stroke, smoking cessation was associated with improved disease-specific outcomes. In summary, whereas smoking is detrimentally associated with disease-specific outcomes in common neurological conditions, there is growing evidence that smoking cessation may improve outcomes. Effective smoking cessation interventions should be leveraged in the management of common neurological disorders to improve patient outcomes."

Studies were reviewed qualitatively in the text, and central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal endothelial characteristics (endothelial cell density, endothelial cell variability, average of endothelial cell size and endothelial cell hexagonality) were introduced for quantitative analyses. Eighteen studies (2077 were smokers and 6429 non-smokers) were identified, of which 17 studies provided data eligible for one or more of the quantitative analyses. When compared to non-smokers, smokers had a higher CCT (+3.3 μm, 95% CI: +0.9 to +5.7 μm, p = 0.007) and a lower endothelial cell density (-140 cells/mm Tobacco use is associated with a higher CCT and lower corneal endothelium cell density, but the clinical impact of these findings is small. Further studies are warranted on patients with a priori poor corneal health, where smoking may constitute an important risk of further progression, for example upon anterior segment surgery."

Totally, 1020 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 3144 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and 1405 patients with diabetes were included in the analysis.

The association between smoking and health care utilization and medical costs in people with CHD group was similar to that in people with COPD; however, there were no significant associations in people with diabetes. This study reveals that the impact of smoking on health care utilization and medical costs varies among patients with COPD, CHD, and diabetes.

We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking with sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C). Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent quitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs attenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in adults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential methylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary intake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K array were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero smoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy drugs. Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with Illumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers within a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood.

Within this time frame, several core tobacco control measures were implemented, the impact of which is outlined within this manuscript. Key successful legislative actions implemented in this time frame led to greater availability of information and further regulation of additives, the banning of mentholated cigarettes, enhanced pictorial package warnings and a regulatory framework for e-cigarettes. While repeated cross-sectional data indicated a 12.5% relative reduction in smoking prevalence after implementation of the TPD, the differential regulation of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco compared with other products, such as cigarillos, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products, may have also led to product displacement. Moreover, as the TPD could not keep up with the ever-changing nicotine product landscape, further adaptations may be needed."

Subgingival plaques were collected from 40 individuals, including smokers of either cigarettes, medwakh, or shisha, and non-smokers seeking dental treatment at the University Dental Hospital in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The entire (~ 1500 bp) 16S rRNA bacterial gene was fully amplified and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore technology. Subjects were compared for the relative abundance and diversity of subgingival microbiota, considering smoking and periodontal condition. The relative abundances of several pathogens were significantly higher among smokers, such as Prevotella denticola and Treponema sp. OMZ 838 in medwakh smokers, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar in cigarette smokers, Streptococcus sanguinis and Tannerella forsythia in shisha smokers. Subgingival microbiome of smokers was altered even in subjects with no or mild periodontitis, probably making them more prone to severe periodontal diseases. Microbiome profiling can be a useful tool for periodontal risk assessment. Further studies are recommended to investigate the impact of tobacco cessation on periodontal disease progression and oral microbiome."

Nicotine, a component of tobacco smoke, has been identified as a premorbid neuroprotectant in other neurological disorders. This study aims to provide better understanding of relationships between tobacco smoking and nicotine use and effect on outcome/recovery from TBI. PubMed database, SCOPUS, and PTSDpub were searched for relevant English-language papers. Twenty-nine human clinical studies and nine animal studies were included. No nicotine-replacement product use in human TBI clinical studies were identified. While smoking tobacco prior to injury can be harmful primarily due to systemic effects that can compromise brain function, animal studies suggest that nicotine as a pharmacological agent may augment recovery of cognitive deficits caused by TBI. While tobacco smoking before or after TBI has been associated with potential harms, many clinical studies downplay correlations for most expected domains. On the other hand, nicotine could provide potential treatment for cognitive deficits following TBI by reversing impaired signaling pathways in the brain including those involving nAChRs, TH, and dopamine. Future studies regarding the impact of cigarette smoking and vaping on patients with TBI are needed ."

Maternal smoking is positively associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and gestational diabetes (GDM), but negatively associated with preeclampsia (PE). In this review, we examine epidemiological, clinical and laboratory studies of smoking effects on immunoregulation during pregnancy, trophoblast function, and placental vasculature development and metabolism. We aim to identify effects of tobacco smoke components on specific placental compartments or cells, which may contribute to the understanding of the influences of maternal smoking on placenta function in normal and pathological pregnancies. Data corroborates that in any trimester, smoking is unsafe for pregnancy and that its detrimental effects outweigh questionable benefits. The effects of maternal smoking on the maternal immune regulation throughout pregnancy and the impact of different tobacco products on fetal growth have not yet been fully understood. Smoking cessation rather than treatment with replacement therapies is recommended for future mothers because also single components of tobacco and its smoke may have detrimental effects on placental function."

While tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases related to the four main groups-cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes-its impact on neuropsychiatric risk is rather elusive. The aim of this review article is to emphasize the importance of smoking as a potential risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease and to identify central pathophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship. There is strong evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies indicating that smoking may increase the risk of various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dementia/cognitive decline, schizophrenia/psychosis, depression, anxiety disorder, and suicidal behavior induced by structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system, mainly centered on inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. From a public health perspective, preventive measures and policies designed to counteract the global epidemic of smoking should necessarily include warnings and actions that address the risk of neuropsychiatric disease."

However, their health effects, especially those associated with long-term use, remain largely uncertain. We conducted an umbrella review of the cardiopulmonary and carcinogenic risks of e-cigarette use, distinguishing between short-term and long-term health effects. The search for systematic reviews was conducted across four electronic databases through 25 January 2022. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 quality appraisal tool. Seventeen systematic reviews, including five meta-analyses, were included in our umbrella review. There was a clear underreporting of e-cigarette devices and e-liquid types, e-cigarette and cigarette exposure, and the health and smoking status of study participants. Overall, the findings suggest that short-term use of e-cigarettes may be associated with acute cardiopulmonary risks, although to a lesser extent than cigarette use. Long-term e-cigarette use may have pulmonary/respiratory benefits in those who switch from chronic cigarette smoking, particularly in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence on intermediate and long-term carcinogenic effects is lacking. This umbrella review underscores the urgent need for systematic reviews with better adherence to established reporting guidelines, consistent definitions of duration of e-cigarette use, a focus on newer devices, and accounting for the impacts of former or current smoking."

These products include electronic cigarettes, waterpipes/hookah, cigars/cigarillo, smokeless tobacco, and heat-not-burn cigarettes. The observed increase in the use of ETRPs is multifactorial and complex but appears to be mainly driven by efforts from the major tobacco companies to reinvent themselves, and present more appealing and allegedly safe(r) tobacco products. However, it is becoming apparent that these products produce substantial amounts of toxic chemicals, many of which have been shown to exert negative health effects, including in the context of the cardiovascular system. Thus, there has been research efforts, albeit limited in general, to characterize the health impact of these products on occlusive/thrombotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we will discuss the potential impact of ETRPs on thrombosis-based CVD. Specifically, we will review how these products and the major chemicals they produce and/or emit can trigger key players in the process of thrombosis, namely inflammation, oxidative stress, platelets, coagulation, and the vascular endothelium, and the relationship between these effects."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of active smoking in adults with asthma is similar in the total population. Smoking is associated with worse clinical control of the disease, a rapid reduction of lung function and a variable response to corticoids. Tobacco consumption negatively affects the quality of life of asthmatic patients as well as increasing the number of medical visits and hospital admissions due to exacerbations. Moreover, smoking entails a higher risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular comorbidities and death in asthmatic patients. Nevertheless, current asthma guidelines do not include specific recommendations on the management of smoking asthmatic patients and the treatment of the smoking habit in this subpopulation. For this reason, a narrative review of the literature was carried out for consensus using a nominal group methodology developed throughout 2019 to extract practical recommendations that would allow the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in smokers, as well as the treatment of smoking in asthmatics, to be improved. The conclusions and recommendations were validated at the SEPAR national congress of the same year. Among the most relevant, the need to address smoking in people with asthma through health advice, pharmacological treatment and behavioral therapy was emphasized, as this is a factor that negatively impacts the symptoms, prognosis and response to asthma treatment. In smokers with suspected asthma, the presence of emphysema and the differential diagnosis of other diseases should be evaluated and the impact of smoking on the result of diagnostic tests should be considered. It is also concluded that smoking reduces the response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, which is why combined therapy with bronchodilators is recommended. La prevalencia de tabaquismo activo en adultos con asma es similar a la de la población general. El tabaquismo se asocia con un peor control clínico de la enfermedad, una disminución acelerada de la función pulmonar y una respuesta irregular a la terapia con glucocorticoides. El consumo de tabaco impacta negativamente en la calidad de vida de los pacientes asmáticos y provoca un incremento en el número de visitas y de hospitalizaciones por exacerbaciones. Además, el tabaquismo aumenta el riesgo de cáncer de pulmón, comorbilidades cardiovasculares y muerte en pacientes asmáticos. A pesar de todo ello, las guías actuales del manejo del asma no incluyen recomendaciones específicas para el manejo de los pacientes asmáticos fumadores. Por este motivo, se procedió a una revisión narrativa de la literatura para un consenso mediante metodología de grupo nominal desarrollada a lo largo del año 2019 para extraer recomendaciones prácticas que permitieran mejorar el diagnóstico y el tratamiento del asma en fumadores, así como el tratamiento del tabaquismo en asmáticos. Las conclusiones y recomendaciones fueron validadas en el congreso nacional de la SEPAR del mismo año. Entre las más relevantes, se incidió en la necesidad de abordar el tabaquismo en las personas con asma mediante consejo sanitario, tratamiento farmacológico y terapia conductual, al ser un factor que impacta negativamente en la sintomatología, el pronóstico y la respuesta al tratamiento del asma. En el fumador con sospecha de asma, se debe evaluar la presencia de enfisema y el diagnóstico diferencial de otras enfermedades y considerar el impacto del tabaquismo en el resultado de las pruebas diagnósticas. También se concluye que el hábito tabáquico reduce la respuesta al tratamiento con corticoides inhalados, por lo que se recomienda terapia combinada con broncodilatadores."

Specific mechanisms by which toxins present in smoke impair cell repair are still being researched and are of prime interest for developing more effective treatments. Current literature suggests toxins present in cigarette smoke and aerosolized e-vapor trigger abnormal intercellular responses, damage mitochondrial function, and consequently disrupt the homeostasis of the organelle's biochemical processes by increasing reactive oxidative species. Increased oxidative stress sets off a cascade of molecular events, disrupting optimal mitochondrial morphology and homeostasis. Furthermore, smoking-induced oxidative stress may also amalgamate with other health factors to contribute to various pathophysiological processes. An increasing number of studies show that toxins may affect mitochondria even through exposure to secondhand or thirdhand smoke. This review assesses the impact of toxins present in tobacco smoke and e-vapor on mitochondrial health, networking, and critical structural processes, including mitochondria fission, fusion, hyper-fusion, fragmentation, and mitophagy. The efforts are focused on discussing current evidence linking toxins present in first, second, and thirdhand smoke to mitochondrial dysfunction."

        "abstract": "While accumulating evidence suggests that people modified their smoking during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it remains unclear whether those most at risk for tobacco-related health disparities did so. The current study examined changes in smoking among several vulnerable smoker populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based survey was distributed in 2020 to 709 adults with socioeconomic disadvantage, affective disorders, or opioid use disorder who participated in a previous study investigating the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on smoking. Current smoking status and rate, and adoption of protective health behaviors in response to the pandemic (eg social distancing, mask wearing) were examined. Among 332 survey respondents (46.8% response rate), 84.6% were current smokers. Repeated measures ANOVA showed that current cigarettes/day (CPD) was higher during COVID than pre-COVID (12.9 ± 1.0 versus 11.6 ± 1.0; p < .001). Most respondents had adopted protective health behaviors to prevent infection (>79% for all behaviors). More than half indicated that they were still leaving their homes specifically to buy cigarettes (64.6%) and were buying more packs per visit to the store (54.5%) than pre-COVID. Individuals unemployed at the time of the survey experienced greater increases in CPD (from 11.4 ± 1.4 to 13.3 ± 1.4, p = .024) as did those with higher levels of anxiety (from 11.5 ± 1.1 to 13.6 ± 1.1, p < .001). Smoking increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in this sample of adults from vulnerable populations, even while most adopted protective health measures to prevent infection. Unemployment and anxiety might identify those at greatest risk for increases in tobacco use. Individuals from populations especially vulnerable to smoking might be at risk for greater harm from cigarette smoking during times of pandemic-related stress. Public health interventions are warranted to ameliorate increases in smoking among these populations. Special attention should be paid to those experiencing unemployment and high anxiety."

This review evaluates the reach and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for smoking. Historically, the reach of smoking treatment has been low, and therefore its impact has been limited, but new reach strategies such as digital interventions and health care system changes offer great promise. Pharmacotherapy tends to be more effective than psychosocial intervention when used clinically, and newer pharmacotherapy strategies hold great promise of further enhancing effectiveness. However, new approaches are needed to advance psychosocial interventions; progress has stagnated because research and dissemination efforts have focused too narrowly on skill training despite evidence that its core content may be inconsequential and the fact that its mechanisms are either unknown or inconsistent with supporting theory. Identifying effective psychosocial content and its mechanisms of action could greatly enhance the effectiveness of counseling, digital, and web interventions."

Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), miRNAs expression, and histone modifications, belong to possible underlying mechanisms linking maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes and later child's development. The aims of this review were to provide an update on (1) the main results of epidemiological studies on the impact of in utero exposure to maternal tobacco smoking on epigenetic mechanisms, and (2) the technical issues and methods used in such studies. In contrast with miRNA and histone modifications, DNAm has been the most extensively studied epigenetic mechanism with regard to in utero exposure to maternal tobacco smoking. Most studies relied on cord blood and children's blood, but placenta is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool, especially for markers of pregnancy exposures. Some recent studies suggest reversibility in DNAm in certain genomic regions as well as memory of smoking exposure in DNAm in other regions, upon smoking cessation before or during pregnancy. Furthermore, reversibility could be more pronounced in miRNA expression compared to DNAm. Increasing evidence based on longitudinal data shows that maternal smoking-associated DNAm changes persist during childhood. In this review, we also discuss some issues related to cell heterogeneity as well as downstream statistical analyses used to relate maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy and epigenetics. The epigenetic effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy have been among the most widely investigated in the epigenetic epidemiology field. However, there are still huge gaps to fill in, including on the impact on miRNA expression and histone modifications to get a better view of the whole epigenetic machinery. The consistency of maternal tobacco smoking effects across epigenetic marks and across tissues will also provide crucial information for future studies. Advancement in bioinformatic and biostatistics approaches is key to develop a comprehensive analysis of these biological systems."

The neurotoxic properties of nicotine are associated with fetal neurodevelopmental disorders and perinatal morbimortality. Recent research has demonstrated the effects of nicotine toxicity on genetic and epigenetic alterations. Smoking cessation strategies including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) show lack of clear evidence of effectiveness and safety in pregnant women. Limited trials using randomized controls concluded that the intermittent use formulation of NRT (gum, sprays, inhaler) in pregnant women is safe because the total dose of nicotine delivered to the fetus is less than continuous-use formulations (transdermal patch). Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) were hyped as a safer alternative during pregnancy. However, refill liquids of ENDS are suspected to be cytotoxic for the fetus. Animal studies revealed the impact of ENDS on neural stem cells, showing a similar risk of pre- and postnatal neurobiological and neurobehavioral disorders to that associated with the exposure to traditional tobacco smoking during early life. There is currently no clear evidence of impact on fetal brain development, but recent research suggests that the current guidelines should be reconsidered. The safety of NRT and ENDS is increasingly being called into question. In this review, we discuss the special features (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism) of nicotine, NRT, and ENDS during pregnancy and postnatal environmental exposure. Further, we assess their impact on pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment."

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the influence of cigarette smoking on outcomes post adjuvant RT in breast cancer patients. OVID Medline, Cochrane and Embase were searched and 1893 articles were identified. A total of 71 articles were included in the review. Study type, published year and sample size, age, systemic therapies, RT techniques and treatment side effects were collected if available. The review found 198 different outcomes which fell into 7 categories and similar outcomes were recorded. 40% of skin reaction outcomes, 50% of cardiovascular outcomes, 71% of reconstruction outcomes, 29% of pulmonary function outcomes, 33% of mortality outcomes and 42% of secondary recurrence outcomes reported significant differences between smokers and non-smokers. None of the articles reported non-smokers to have a higher risk than smokers. Cigarette smoking can pose a higher risk of post-treatment complications that can influence an individual's quality of life, survival rate and/or recurrence risk. This review further assessed the impact of smoking on various patient outcomes and side-effects in the adjuvant breast RT setting. The information provided in this review suggest that smoking cessation programs would help educate patients to understand their risks of being a current or former smoker when undergoing RT."

In this study, we examine the relationship between maternal prenatal smoking, infant TL, and maternal report of early childhood symptoms of ADHD. One-hundred and eighty-one mother-infant dyads were followed prospectively for the infant's first 18 months of life. Prenatal smoking was assessed from maternal report and medical records. TL was measured from infant buccal swab DNA obtained across the first 18 months of life. ADHD symptoms were obtained from maternal report on the Child Behavior Check List. Multiple regression models tested the relation between prenatal smoking and both ADHD symptoms and infant TL. Additional analyses tested whether the change in infant TL influenced the relation between prenatal smoking and ADHD symptoms. Sixteen percent of mothers reported prenatal smoking. Infant TL at 4, 12, and 18 months of age were correlated. Consistent with previous cross-sectional studies linking shorter offspring TL to maternal prenatal smoking, maternal prenatal smoking predicted greater telomere shortening from four to 18 months of infant age (β = - 5.797, 95% CI [-10.207, -1.386]; p = 0.010). Maternal depression was positively associated with both prenatal smoking (odds ratio (OR): 4.614, 95% CI [1.733, 12.282]; p = 0.002) and child ADHD symptoms (β = 4.713, 95% CI [2.073, 7.354]; p = 0.0006). To prevent confounding, analyses examined the relation between TL, ADHD symptoms, and prenatal smoking only in non-depressed mothers. In non-depressed mothers, infant TL attrition across the first 18 months moderated the relation between smoking and child ADHD. The findings extend previous studies linking prenatal smoking to shorter infant TL by providing data demonstrating the effect on TL trajectory. The relation between prenatal smoking and early infant ADHD symptoms was moderated by the change in TL. The findings provide novel initial evidence suggesting that TL dynamics are one mechanistic pathway influencing the relation between maternal prenatal smoking and ADHD."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the total number of couples visiting an infertility clinic is on the rise. Tobacco smoking is considered one of the major factors leading to male infertility. In this study, we aimed to systematically investigate the impact of tobacco smoking on semen quality in infertile male participants. Online databases (Cochrane Central database of Randomized Controlled Trials and the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE respectively) were searched for relevant English publications that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this analysis. The clinical endpoints which were assessed included semen parameters (oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and azoospermia), morphological defects of spermatozoa and the hormones involved in reproduction. RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze the data whereby mean difference (MD) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated to represent the results. Sixteen studies with a total number of 10,823 infertile male participants (5257 smokers and 5566 non-smokers) were included. Results of this analysis showed oligozoospermia to be significantly higher in smokers (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05-1.59; P = 0.02). Morphological defect of spermatozoa (MD: 2.44, 95% CI: 0.99-3.89; P = 0.001) was also significantly higher in smokers whereby significant head (MD: 1.76, 95% CI: 0.32-3.20; P = 0.02), neck (MD: 1.97, 95% CI: 0.75-3.18; P = 0.002) and tail (MD: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.35-2.22; P = 0.007) defects were observed. However, smoking did not affected the pH (MD: 0.04, 95% CI: [- 0.03-0.11]; P = 0.30) and motility (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.97-2.09; P = 0.07) of spermatozoa. Additionally, tobacco smoking did not cause any dis-balance in hormones which were involved in reproduction. In conclusion, with reference to the clinical endpoints which were studied in this analysis, tobacco smoking was associated with a lower sperm count and an increase in the number of morphological defects of spermatozoa. However, the pH and motility of spermatozoa as well as the production of hormones which were involved in reproduction were not affected in this population of infertile males."

        "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLWH) in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era may lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV. Yet, smoking rates are more than twice as high among PLWH than the general population, contributing not just to mortality but to other adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits (neuroHIV). There is growing evidence that synergy with chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation that persists despite ART may be one mechanism by which tobacco smoking contributes to neuroHIV. This review will summarize the differential effects of nicotine vs tobacco smoking on inflammation in addition to the effects of tobacco smoke components on HIV disease progression. We will also discuss biomarkers of inflammation via neuroimaging as well as biomarkers of nicotine dependence (e.g., nicotine metabolite ratio). Tobacco smoking and nicotine may impact ART drug metabolism and conversely, certain ARTs may impact nicotine metabolism. Thus, we will review these bidirectional relationships and how they may contribute to neuroHIV and other adverse outcomes. We will also discuss the effects of tobacco use on the interaction between peripheral organs (lungs, heart, kidney) and subsequent CNS function in the context of HIV. Lastly, given the dramatic rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, we will discuss the implications of vaping on these processes. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of addressing tobacco use among PLWH, more research is necessary at both the preclinical and clinical level to disentangle the potentially synergistic effects of tobacco use, nicotine, HIV, cognition and immune dysregulation, as well as identify optimal approaches to reduce tobacco use. Graphical Abstract Proposed model of the relationships among HIV, ART, smoking, inflammation, and neurocognition. Solid lines represent relationships supported by evidence. Dashed lines represent relationships for which there is not enough evidence to make a conclusion. (a) HIV infection produces elevated levels of inflammation even among virally suppressed individuals. (b) HIV is associated with deficits in cognition function. (c) Smoking rates are higher among PLWH, compared to the general population. (d) The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) is associated with smoking behavior. (e) HIV and tobacco use are both associated with higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, and elevated levels of chronic stress. These factors may represent other mechanisms linking HIV and tobacco use. (f) The relationship between nicotine, tobacco smoking, and inflammation is complex, but it is well-established that smoking induces inflammation; the evidence for nicotine as anti-inflammatory is supported in some studies, but not others. (g) The relationship between tobacco use and neurocognition may differ for the effects of nicotine (acute nicotine use may have beneficial effects) vs. tobacco smoking (chronic use may impair cognition). (h) Elevated levels of inflammation may be associated with deficits in cognition. (i) PLWH may metabolize nicotine faster than those without HIV; the mechanism is not yet known and the finding needs validation in larger samples. We also hypothesize that if HIV-infection increases nicotine metabolism, then we should observe an attenuation effect once ART is initiated. (j) It is possible that the increase in NMR is due to ART effects on CYP2A6. (k) We hypothesize that faster nicotine metabolism may result in higher levels of inflammation since nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties."

Arsenic exposure affects the drinking water of millions of people worldwide. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even in low concentrations, increases the risk of developing various cancers. Smoking is also one of the leading causes of bladder, prostate and kidney cancers. Accordingly, this research reviews the relationship between arsenic exposure and smoking with three kinds of urinary tract cancers (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney cancer) due to their widespread concern for their negative impact on public health globally. In this review, we have gathered the most current information from scientific databases [PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ISI web of science] regarding the relationship between arsenic exposure and tobacco smoking with the risk of bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer. In several studies, a significant relationship was determined between the incidence and mortality rate of the above-mentioned cancers in humans with arsenic exposure and tobacco smoking. The decrease or cessation of smoking and consumption of arsenic-free water significantly declined the incidence of bladder, prostate, and kidney cancers."

We have previously reported a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of exposure to smoking imagery in films on the risk of smoking uptake in young people. This study updates that review, and includes studies of the effects of exposure to media vaping imagery on vaping uptake. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and IBSS) were searched to August 2020 for studies reporting the association between exposure to smoking/vaping in films and smoking/vaping uptake in adolescents. Two authors independently screened papers, extracted data, and assessed quality. This review included 26 studies. Exposure to high levels of smoking imagery in films was associated with an increased likelihood of having ever smoked in nine cross-sectional studies and of smoking uptake in 11 longitudinal studies. Vaping imagery in films was associated with increased likelihood of ever vaping in two cross-sectional studies and vaping uptake in five longitudinal studies. This review concluded that exposure to smoking imagery in films increases the risk of smoking among young people. It is likely that a similar association exists between exposure to vaping imagery and vaping uptake. Therefore, this review recommends introduction of new policies to minimize the impact of this in films which contain smoking or vaping and are likely to be viewed by children and adolescents."

The aim of this article is to map, in the Portuguese context, how educational inequalities in smoking emerge from pre-adolescence until young adulthood. This study used longitudinal data from the EPITeen Cohort, which recruited adolescents enrolled in schools in Porto, Portugal. We included the 1,038 participants followed at ages 13 (2003/2004), 17, 21, and 24 years. We computed the odds ratio (OR) for the prevalence of smoking states (never smoking, experimenter, less-than-daily, daily and former smoker) and the incidence of transitions between these states, as function of age and education, stratified by sex. We also added interaction terms between age and education. Educational inequalities in daily smoking prevalence, with higher prevalence among those with lower educational level, emerged at 17 years old and persisted until higher ages. They were formed in a cumulative way by the increased risk of experimenting between 13 and 17 years, and increased risk of becoming daily smoker between 17 and 21 years. The incidence of smoking cessation was higher among the higher educated. Inequalities were formed similarly for women and men, but with lower level and showed no significance among women. These results highlight that actions to prevent smoking should also take in account the potential impact in smoking inequalities, and should focus not only on middle adolescence but also on late adolescence and early adulthood."

Between-subjects randomised experiment using a 2 (e-cigarette retail display visibility: high vs low)×2 (proportion of e-cigarette images: 75% vs 25%) factorial design. Online via the Qualtrics survey platform. UK children aged 13-17 years (n=1034), recruited through a research agency. Participants viewed 12 images of retail displays that contained e-cigarette display images or unrelated product images. E-cigarette display images were either high or low visibility, based on a conspicuousness score. Participants were randomised to one of four groups, with e-cigarette display visibility and proportion of e-cigarette images, compared with images of unrelated products, manipulated: (1) 75% e-cigarettes, high visibility; (2) 25% e-cigarettes, high visibility; (3) 75% e-cigarettes, low visibility; (4) 25% e-cigarettes, low visibility. The primary outcome was susceptibility to smoking (among never smokers only). Secondary outcomes were susceptibility to using e-cigarettes (among never vapers only), and perceptions of smoking and e-cigarette harm (all participants). Neither e-cigarette retail display visibility, nor the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed, appeared to influence susceptibility to smoking (visibility: OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.13, p=0.24; proportion: OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.82, p=0.054 (reference: low visibility, not susceptible)).Planned subgroup analyses indicated that exposure to a higher proportion of e-cigarette images increased susceptibility to smoking among children who visited retail stores more regularly (n=524, OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.43, p=0.034), and those who passed the attention check (n=880, OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.031).In addition, neither e-cigarette retail display visibility nor the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed, appeared to influence susceptibility to using e-cigarettes (visibility: OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43, p=0.65; proportion: OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64, p=0.18).Greater visibility of e-cigarette retail displays reduced perceived harm of smoking (mean difference (MD)=-0.19, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.04, p=0.016). There was no evidence that the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed had an effect (MD=-0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.09, p=0.40).Perceived harm of e-cigarette use did not appear to be affected by e-cigarette retail display visibility (MD=-0.12, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.05, p=0.16) or by the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed (MD=-0.10, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.07, p=0.24). There is no evidence in the full sample to suggest that children's susceptibility to smoking is increased by exposure to higher visibility e-cigarette retail displays, or to a higher proportion of e-cigarette images. However, for regular store visitors or those paying more attention, viewing a higher proportion of e-cigarette images increased susceptibility to smoking. In addition, viewing higher visibility e-cigarette images reduced perceived harm of smoking.

We explored the effect of county-level SFO strength with smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence in Indiana. We obtained county-level lung cancer incidence from the Indiana State Cancer Registry and county-level characteristics from the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission's policy database between 1995 and 2016. Using generalized estimating equations, we performed multivariable analyses of smoking prevalence and age-adjusted lung cancer rates with respect to the strength of smoke-free ordinances at the county level over time. Of Indiana's 92 counties, 24 had a SFO by 2011. In 2012, Indiana enacted a state-wide SFO enforcing at least moderate level SFO protection. Mean age-adjusted lung cancer incidence per year was 76.8 per 100,000 population and mean smoking prevalence per year was 25% during the study period. Counties with comprehensive or moderate SFO had a smoking prevalence 1.2% (95% CI [-1.88, -0.52]) lower compared with counties with weak or no SFO. Counties that had comprehensive or moderate SFO also had an 8.4 (95% CI [-11.5, -5.3]) decrease in new lung cancer diagnosis per 100,000 population per year compared with counties that had weak or no SFO. Counties with stronger smoke-free air ordinances were associated with decreased smoking prevalence and fewer new lung cancer cases per year. Strengthening SFO is paramount to decreasing lung cancer incidence."

The potential impact of these technologies in the fight against smoking addiction and on improving quitting rates must be systematically evaluated. The aim of this report is to identify and appraise the most promising smoking detection and quitting technologies (e.g., smartphone apps, wearable devices) supporting smoking reduction or quitting programs. We searched PubMed and Scopus databases (2008-2019) for studies on mobile health technologies developed to assist smokers to quit using a combination of Medical Subject Headings topics and free text terms. A Google search was also performed to retrieve the most relevant smartphone apps for quitting smoking, considering the average user's rating and the ranking computed by the search engine algorithms. All included studies were evaluated using consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, such as applied methodologies and the performed evaluation protocol. Main outcome measures were usability and effectiveness of smoking detection and quitting technologies supporting smoking reduction or quitting programs. Our search identified 32 smoking detection and quitting technologies (12 smoking detection systems and 20 smoking quitting smartphone apps). Most of the existing apps for quitting smoking require the users to register every smoking event. Moreover, only a restricted group of them have been scientifically evaluated. The works supported by documented experimental evaluation show very high detection scores, however the experimental protocols usually lack in variability (e.g., only right-hand patients, not natural sequence of gestures) and have been conducted with limited numbers of patients as well as under constrained settings quite far from real-life use scenarios. Several recent scientific works show very promising results but, at the same time, present obstacles for the application on real-life daily scenarios."

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the magnitude and consistency of association reported by those studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis was guided by the PRISMA protocol. Relevant epidemiological studies on the topic were extracted from four main databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. We conducted a narrative assessment of the studies that did not report effect estimates. Inverse variance-weighted random effect meta-analysis was used to combine studies reporting effect sizes to estimate pooled adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022350901). Nineteen observational studies, published between 1973 and 2021 with a total of 1.25 million study participants were included in the final review. Of these, fifteen studies (79 %) reported reduced academic achievement in offspring exposed to maternal prenatal tobacco smoking. The eight primary studies (sample size = 723,877) included in the meta-analysis together suggested a 49 % higher risk of reduced academic achievement in offspring exposed to maternal prenatal tobacco smoking when compared to non-exposed offspring (Pooled odds ratio = 1.49, 95 % CI:1.17-1.91). Our review found a positive association between maternal prenatal tobacco smoking and offspring reduced academic achievement. However, variation in the adjustment of potential confounders and significant heterogeneity across included studies limited more conclusive inference. Mechanistic studies to identify causal pathways and specific academic impacts are needed to inform targeted developmental programs to assist child learning and academic performance."

First, to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of Preventive Medicine and its role in disseminating research on cigarette smoking by providing an abridged summary of smoking research published in the journal from inception through June 23, 2022. Second, to review experimental reports to identify contributions to innovations in tobacco control and regulatory efforts to reduce cigarette smoking. We searched PubMed using the search terms cigarette/cigarettes, tobacco products, smoking, smoking cessation, Preventive Medicine. Titles and abstracts were reviewed in duplicate, excluding reports not addressing cigarette smoking. Included reports were categorized by study type (original study, commentary, review). Experimental articles were assessed for impact using iCite, a National Institutes of Health web application that provides bibliometric information for articles in defined topic areas. The review identified 1181 articles on cigarette smoking: 1018 original studies (86.2%), 107 literature reviews (9.1%), and 56 commentaries (4.7%); 166 of the 1018 original studies (16%) were experimental reports. In the iCite analysis these 166 experimental articles received 6366 total citations, a mean (standard error) citation rate/article of 38.35 (±3.21) and mean relative citation ratio of 1.85 (±0.17) which is at the 73rd percentile for NIH-funded field- and time-normalized reports. Overall, this review demonstrates an ongoing and impactful contribution of Preventive Medicine to efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, the most preventable cause of premature death."

Their combined impact on secular trends in life expectancy is unknown but is relevant for understanding these trends. We therefore estimate the combined impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol on life-expectancy trends in Europe. We used estimated national age-specific smoking-, obesity- and alcohol-attributable mortality fractions for 30 European countries by sex, 1990-2014, which we aggregated multiplicatively to obtain lifestyle-attributable mortality. We estimated potential gains in life expectancy by eliminating lifestyle-attributable mortality and compared past trends in life expectancy at birth (e0) with and without lifestyle-attributable mortality. We examined all countries combined, by region and individually. Among men, the combined impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol on e0 declined from 6.6 years in 1990 to 5.8 years in 2014, mainly due to declining smoking-attributable mortality. Among women, the combined impact increased from 1.9 to 2.3 years due to mortality increases in all three lifestyle-related factors. The observed increase in e0 over the 1990-2014 period was 5.0 years for men and 4.0 years for women. After excluding lifestyle-attributable mortality, this increase would have been 4.2-4.3 years for both men and women. Without the combined impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol, the increase over time in life expectancy at birth would have been smaller among men but larger among women, resulting in a stable increase in e0, parallel for men and women."

Vaping has grown in popularity over the past decade, in part propelled by innovations in vape pen design and nicotine flavoring. Teens and young adults have seen the biggest uptake in use of vape pens, which have superseded conventional cigarettes as the preferred modality of nicotine consumption. Relatively little is known, however, about the potential effects of chronic vaping on the respiratory system. Further, the role of vaping as a tool of smoking cessation and tobacco harm reduction remains controversial. The 2019 E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) outbreak highlighted the potential harms of vaping, and the consequences of long term use remain unknown. Here, we review the growing body of literature investigating the impacts of vaping on respiratory health. We review the clinical manifestations of vaping related lung injury, including the EVALI outbreak, as well as the effects of chronic vaping on respiratory health and covid-19 outcomes. We conclude that vaping is not without risk, and that further investigation is required to establish clear public policy guidance and regulation."

        "abstract": "Vaping and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use have grown exponentially in the past decade, particularly among youth and young adults. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for both cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Because of their more limited ingredients and the absence of combustion, e-cigarettes and vaping products are often touted as safer alternative and potential tobacco-cessation products. The outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury in the United States in 2019, which led to >2800 hospitalizations, highlighted the risks of e-cigarettes and vaping products. Currently, all e-cigarettes are regulated as tobacco products and thus do not undergo the premarket animal and human safety studies required of a drug product or medical device. Because youth prevalence of e-cigarette and vaping product use was as high as 27.5% in high school students in 2019 in the United States, it is critical to assess the short-term and long-term health effects of these products, as well as the development of interventional and public health efforts to reduce youth use. The objectives of this scientific statement are (1) to describe and discuss e-cigarettes and vaping products use patterns among youth and adults; (2) to identify harmful and potentially harmful constituents in vaping aerosols; (3) to critically assess the molecular, animal, and clinical evidence on the acute and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary risks of e-cigarette and vaping products use; (4) to describe the current evidence of e-cigarettes and vaping products as potential tobacco-cessation products; and (5) to summarize current public health and regulatory efforts of e-cigarettes and vaping products. It is timely, therefore, to review the short-term and especially the long-term implications of e-cigarettes and vaping products on cardiopulmonary health. Early molecular and clinical evidence suggests various acute physiological effects from electronic nicotine delivery systems, particularly those containing nicotine. Additional clinical and animal-exposure model research is critically needed as the use of these products continues to grow."

Umbrella review (based on major independent reviews, including the 2018 United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM] report) and top-up systematic review of published, peer-reviewed studies in humans examining the relationship of e-cigarette use to health outcomes published since the NASEM report. Umbrella review: eight major independent reviews published 2017-2021. Systematic review: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO (articles published July 2017 - July 2020 and not included in NASEM review). Four hundred eligible publications were included in our synthesis: 112 from the NASEM review, 189 from our top-up review search, and 99 further publications cited by other reviews. There is conclusive evidence linking e-cigarette use with poisoning, immediate inhalation toxicity (including seizures), and e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI; largely but not exclusively for e-liquids containing tetrahydrocannabinol and vitamin E acetate), as well as for malfunctioning devices causing injuries and burns. Environmental effects include waste, fires, and generation of indoor airborne particulate matter (substantial to conclusive evidence). There is substantial evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes can cause dependence or addiction in non-smokers, and strong evidence that young non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are more likely than non-users to initiate smoking and to become regular smokers. There is limited evidence that freebase nicotine e-cigarettes used with clinical support are efficacious aids for smoking cessation. Evidence regarding effects on other clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, development, and mental and reproductive health, is insufficient or unavailable. E-cigarettes can be harmful to health, particularly for non-smokers and children, adolescents, and young adults. Their effects on many important health outcomes are uncertain. E-cigarettes may be beneficial for smokers who use them to completely and promptly quit smoking, but they are not currently approved smoking cessation aids. Better quality evidence is needed regarding the health impact of e-cigarette use, their safety and efficacy for smoking cessation, and effective regulation.

More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco's effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions. These efforts associated with innovative policy regulations (aimed at reducing nicotine content or eliminating tobacco products) have the potential to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and nicotine use and their enormous adverse impact on population health."

Although there has been a decline in teen use of cigarettes in recent years, there has been a huge increase in nicotine vaping. It is therefore critically important to understand the impact of nicotine on this critical phase of brain development. Animal studies have shown that nicotine has unique effects on adolescent brain. The goal of this review is therefore to systematically evaluate age- and sex-differences in the effects of nicotine on brain and behavior. Both acute and chronic effects of nicotine on brain biochemistry and behavior, particularly drug reward, aversion, cognition and emotion, are evaluated. Gaps in our current knowledge that need to be addressed are also highlighted. This review compares and integrates human and animals findings. Although there can be no experimental studies in humans to confirm similar behavioral effects of teen nicotine exposure, an emerging observational literature suggests similarities across species. Given the substantial evidence for long-term negative impact of adolescent nicotine exposure on brain and behavior, further longitudinal assessment of health outcomes in teen and young adult e-cigarette users is warranted."

Airway irritation, mucus hypersecretion, and inflammatory response, including systemic changes, have been observed after the exposure to e-cigarettes, leading to an increase in respiratory symptoms and changes in respiratory function and the host defense mechanisms. E-cigarette has been linked with an increase of symptoms in individuals with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the major concerns in public health is the rise in e-cigarette experimentation among never-smokers, especially children and adolescents, which leads to nicotine addiction and increases the chances of becoming with time a conventional smoker. There is an urgent need to regulate e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems, at least with the same restrictions to those applied to tobacco products, and not to consider them as harmless products."

E-cigarettes are sometimes regarded as a less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking, and there is some evidence of their potential role as a smoking cessation aid. However, there are concerns about their health consequences, particularly in users who are not tobacco smokers, and also when used long term. Given the mode of delivery of these products, there is potential for oral health consequences. Over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of studies conducted to explore their oral health effects. In vitro studies have reported a range of cellular effects, but these are much less pronounced than those resulting from exposure to tobacco smoke. Microbiological studies have indicated that e-cigarette users have a distinct microbiome, and there is some indication this may be more pathogenic compared to nonusers. Evidence of oral health effects from clinical trials is still limited, and most studies to date have been small in scale and usually cross-sectional in design. Epidemiological studies highlight concerns over oral dryness, irritation, and gingival diseases. Interpreting data from e-cigarette studies is challenging, given the different populations that have been investigated and the continual emergence of new products. Overall, studies reveal potential oral health harms, underscoring the importance of efforts to reduce use in nonsmokers. However, in smokers who are using e-cigarettes as an aid to help them quit, the benefits of quitting tobacco smoking may outweigh any negative oral health impacts of e-cigarette use, particularly in the short term. Future research is needed to understand the clinical significance of some of the biological changes observed by following different cohorts of users longitudinally in carefully designed clinical studies and pragmatic trials supported by high-quality in vitro studies."

An estimated 15.4% of all deaths in the world are attributable to tobacco smoking. The present review aims to describe addiction to tobacco smoking and vaping. Tobacco and vaping devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug, which explains why smoking is so prevalent and persistent. Electronic cigarettes are a group of novel nicotine or tobacco products that have rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Electronic cigarette devices allow for the use of other drugs, including THC, while the lax regulation may allow for the introduction of toxic compounds that can lead to acute or subacute toxicity, such as the e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury that has been linked to vitamin E acetate. In addition, regular vapers and heated tobacco devices emit toxins, although at lower concentrations than burned tobacco. However, more and more side effects have been identified. No new effective treatment for nicotine addiction has been developed recently, despite its huge adverse impact on overall health and other outcomes. As for the primary line of medications, the last one started in 2006, the varenicline, demonstrating a low interest in developing new medications against smoking, an unacceptable state of affairs, given the huge impact of smoking on morbidity and mortality."

        "abstract": "Narrative review. What are the implications of new nicotine and tobacco products on adolescent health? E-cigarettes and oral nicotine products such as pouches, lozenges, tablets, gum, and gummies. These products can be addictive and can cause respiratory, cardiovascular and oral potential health problems. They also have effects on brain development. Products are attractive to adolescents, with more than 1:10 American adolescents uses them. The use of nicotine and tobacco products by adolescents puts their health at risk and may, in some instances, lead to nicotine addiction. Those providing healthcare for adolescents have an opportunity to provide advice and signpost people to resources to help them stop using such products. There is also a need for legislation to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products."

        "abstract": "Hookah or waterpipe smoking or use is an emerging trend in the US population, especially among the youth. The misperception of hookah being less harmful than cigarettes and the availability of different but \"appealing\" flavors are considered among the main reasons for this trend. Hookah users however are exposed to many of the same toxic compounds/by-products as cigarette users, but at dramatically higher levels, which might lead to more severe negative health effects. In fact, hookah users are at risks of infections, cancers, lung disease, and other medical conditions. Moreover, because of the overlapping toxicant/chemical profile to conventional cigarettes, hookah smoke effects on the cardiovascular system are thought to be comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. A major source of tobacco addiction is nicotine, whose levels in hookah are extremely variable as they depend on the type of tobacco used. Taken together, in this review of literature, we will provide insights on the negative health effects of hookah in general, with a focus on what is known regarding its impact on the cardiovascular system."

HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2α, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence. Research seems to be necessary to assess the frequency of HTP use and its potential negative health effects."

        "abstract": "Given the rise in teenage use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"vaping\") in congruence with the increasing numbers of drug-related emergencies, it is critical to expand the knowledge of the physical and behavioral risks associated with developmental nicotine exposure. A further understanding of the molecular and neurochemical underpinnings of nicotine's gateway effects allows emergency clinicians to advise patients and families and adjust treatment accordingly, which may minimize the use of tobacco, nicotine, and future substances. Currently, the growing use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes among teenagers represents a major public health concern. Adolescent exposure to tobacco or nicotine can lead to subsequent abuse of nicotine and other substances, which is known as the gateway hypothesis. Adolescence is a developmentally sensitive time period when risk-taking behaviors, such as sensation seeking and drug experimentation, often begin. These hallmark behaviors of adolescence are largely due to maturational changes in the brain. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs of abuse, including tobacco and nicotine products, which activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Disruption of nAChR development with early nicotine use may influence the function and pharmacology of the receptor subunits and alter the release of reward-related neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, serotonin, and glutamate. In this review, we emphasize that the effects of nicotine are highly dependent on timing of exposure, with a dynamic interaction of nAChRs with dopaminergic, endocannabinoid, and opioidergic systems to enhance general drug reward and reinforcement. We analyzed available literature regarding adolescent substance use and nicotine's impact on the developing brain and behavior using the electronic databases of PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published in English between January 1968 and November 2018. We present a large collection of clinical and preclinical evidence that adolescent nicotine exposure influences long-term molecular, biochemical, and functional changes in the brain that encourage subsequent drug abuse."

This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects. To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022. We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies. We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.  MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.  There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported."

However, short- and long-term health effects remain largely unknown due to the novelty of this product. The present study examines the acute effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, with and without nicotine, on vascular and pulmonary function in healthy volunteers. Seventeen healthy subjects inhaled electronic cigarette aerosol with and without nicotine on two separate occasions in a double-blinded crossover fashion. Blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis were assessed at baseline, and then at 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h following exposure. Dynamic spirometry and impulse oscillometry were measured following vascular assessments at these time points, as well as at 6 h following exposure. e-Cigarette aerosol with nicotine caused a significant increase in heart rate and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, e-cigarette aerosol-containing nicotine caused a sudden increase in flow resistance as measured by impulse oscillometry, indicating obstruction of the conducting airways. Both aerosols caused an increase in blood pressure. The present study indicates that inhaled e-cigarette aerosol with nicotine has an acute impact on vascular and pulmonary function. Thus, chronic usage may lead to long-term adverse health effects. Further investigation is warranted."

It is also associated with impaired beta-cell function in humans, but again the mechanisms are poorly understood. Mechanistic studies of the impact of smoking on carbohydrate metabolism mainly evaluated nicotine as the causal agent, and more rarely other tobacco constituents, making it impossible to conclude that the risk of diabetes is linked to the effects of nicotine alone. Active smoking also has negative impact on glycemic control in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of all-cause mortality and worsens the chronic complications of diabetes. Impact on microangiopathic complications in type-2 diabetic patients, however, is more controversial. Data on pharmacological and behavioral strategies for smoking cessation used in the general population are more sparse in diabetic patients, despite opportunities with recent therapeutic trials involving varenicline and GLP-1 analogues. It is essential for diabetic patients to stop smoking, and diabetologists must get involved in smoking cessation as they have done for many years in therapeutic education, which can easily include measures to help patients stop smoking."

Participants used NP for periods ranging from 1 month to 10 years. Among these studies, only one study provided information on the usage pattern between 1 and 5 units for an average of 11 ± 7 min per session. Oral mucosal changes at the site of placement were common among NP users. Oral lesions varied from slight wrinkling to various white lesions, seemingly related to the NP units consumed per day and their duration of usage. Other oral side effects included dry mouth, soreness, gingival blisters, and a strange jaw sensation. Research on the use of NP and its effect on oral health are currently limited. The use of NP should take into consideration the short-and-long-term effects, especially on oral health. Further studies are crucial to understand oral health implications associated with NP usage.

PubMed database, SCOPUS, and PTSDpub were searched for relevant English-language papers. Twenty-nine human clinical studies and nine animal studies were included. No nicotine-replacement product use in human TBI clinical studies were identified. While smoking tobacco prior to injury can be harmful primarily due to systemic effects that can compromise brain function, animal studies suggest that nicotine as a pharmacological agent may augment recovery of cognitive deficits caused by TBI. While tobacco smoking before or after TBI has been associated with potential harms, many clinical studies downplay correlations for most expected domains. On the other hand, nicotine could provide potential treatment for cognitive deficits following TBI by reversing impaired signaling pathways in the brain including those involving nAChRs, TH, and dopamine. Future studies regarding the impact of cigarette smoking and vaping on patients with TBI are needed ."

Germline epigenetic marks are modified by drug exposure and have emerged as promising mechanistic candidates in recent work. Drug exposure also impacts overall germline integrity and reproductive functioning, although the role of these consequences in multi/transgenerational inheritance is unclear. This review synthesizes literature on effects of exposure to alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine on the germline with a focus on epigenetic modifications following drug exposure and broader impacts on germline integrity and reproductive functioning. We discuss potential interactions between reproductive functioning, germline integrity, and germline epigenome/transcriptome in pathways underlying multi/transgenerational inheritance.

To further evaluate the impact of EC use on vascular health, we investigated the effects of brief EC inhalation on flow-dependent thrombus formation and microcirculation in healthy volunteers. The study was performed with a randomised double-blind crossover design. Twenty-two healthy subjects aged between 18 and 45 years with occasional tobacco use were recruited. Subjects inhaled 30 puffs of EC aerosol with and without nicotine on two occasions separated by a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 15 and 60 min following exposure and analysed with the Total-Thrombus-formation analysis system evaluating fibrin-rich thrombus formation and platelet thrombus formation in whole blood under flow. Microvascular function was assessed at baseline and 30 min after exposure by laser speckle contrast imaging and iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to evaluate the endothelium-dependent and independent pathways of vasodilation. Compared with nicotine free EC aerosol, exposure to EC aerosol with nicotine significantly increased platelet thrombus formation and fibrin-rich thrombus formation at 15 min (p = 0.017 and p = 0.037, respectively) with normalisation after 60 min. Peak SNP-mediated microvascular perfusion, i.e. endothelium-independent vasodilation, was reduced following EC vaping with nicotine compared with baseline (p = 0.006). Thirty puffs of EC aerosol with nicotine increased platelet and fibrin-dependent thrombus formation and reduced microvascular dilatation capacity. No compelling effects of EC vaping without nicotine were observed, indicating nicotine as the main effector.

While large variations across studies were observed in ONP youth prevalence estimates, nationally representative U.S. studies find current use at 1.5% and lifetime use below 2.5% through 2023. Between 35% and 42% of U.S. adolescents and young adults have heard of ONPs, and 9-21% of tobacco-naïve youth were susceptible to trying them. U.S. adult-use estimates varied widely (0.8%-3% current; 3%-16% lifetime use) and were limited to populations with a history of tobacco use. The chemical composition of ONPs suggests fewer harmful/potentially harmful compounds at lower levels than cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (SLT), except formaldehyde. Industry-funded studies find substantially less cytotoxicity compared to cigarettes and suggest that higher nicotine-strength ONPs can deliver nicotine at levels comparable to or higher than SLT or cigarettes, although with slower nicotine release than cigarettes. Evidence on the cytotoxicity of ONPs relative to SLT is mixed. ONPs appear to be less toxic than cigarettes and deliver comparable nicotine, presenting an alternative for combustible product users, although key data are mainly available from industry-funded studies. Data from independent research is critically needed. Industry marketing of ONPs may encourage initiation in youth and situational and dual use in adults. The review provides an initial assessment of the potential role of ONPs in harm reduction and aims to determine unintended consequences of their use (youth uptake and dual-use) and identify populations that disproportionately use the product. This information is essential for tobacco regulatory bodies in determining the net public health impact of nicotine pouches."

Such alteration can be a predisposing factor for autoimmune diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This review aims to shed light on the effects of nicotine smoking on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of SpA and RA. This review looked into the studies, excluding case reports and series, which were cited by PubMed/MEDLINE. Patients with established autoimmune conditions may have a different underlying pathophysiology and disease course when exposed to nicotine through cigarette smoking. Through the involvement of several cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, and epigenetic mechanisms, the severity of SpA is more prominent in smokers. The global health status, pain, and fatigue are worse in SpA patients. The evidence on the effect of nicotine smoking on the treatment of SpA is still limited. Nicotine can contribute to RA via the disruption of cellular regulatory activity, inflammatory responses, morphological, physiological, biochemical, and enzymatic responses. As such, smokers with RA have higher disease activity and are more likely to be seropositive through the citrullination of peptides. In addition, these patients are at risk of achieving a suboptimal response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Cigarette smoking can substantially affect the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of patients with SpA and RA. The impact of nicotine on the management of these diseases still needs to be further studied."

One key system that may mediate the association between adolescent stress and nicotine or affective outcomes is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Here we reviewed evidence regarding the effects of adolescent stress on nicotine responses and affective phenotypes and the role of the HPA-axis in these relationships. Literature indicates that stress, possibly via HPA-axis dysfunction, is a risk factor for both nicotine use and affective disorders. In rodent models, adolescent stress modulates behavioural responses to nicotine and increases the likelihood of affective disorders. The exact role that the HPA-axis plays in altering nicotine sensitivity and affective disorder development after adolescent stress remains unclear. However, it appears likely that adolescent stress-induced nicotine use and affective disorders are precipitated by repetitive activation of a hyperactive HPA-axis. Together, these preclinical studies indicate that adolescent stress is a risk factor for nicotine use and anxiety/depression phenotypes. The findings summarized here suggest that the HPA-axis mediates this relationship. Future studies that pharmacologically manipulate the HPA-axis during and after adolescent stress are critical to elucidate the exact role that the HPA-axis plays in the development of nicotine use and affective disorders following adolescent stress."

The neurotoxic properties of nicotine are associated with fetal neurodevelopmental disorders and perinatal morbimortality. Recent research has demonstrated the effects of nicotine toxicity on genetic and epigenetic alterations. Smoking cessation strategies including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) show lack of clear evidence of effectiveness and safety in pregnant women. Limited trials using randomized controls concluded that the intermittent use formulation of NRT (gum, sprays, inhaler) in pregnant women is safe because the total dose of nicotine delivered to the fetus is less than continuous-use formulations (transdermal patch). Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) were hyped as a safer alternative during pregnancy. However, refill liquids of ENDS are suspected to be cytotoxic for the fetus. Animal studies revealed the impact of ENDS on neural stem cells, showing a similar risk of pre- and postnatal neurobiological and neurobehavioral disorders to that associated with the exposure to traditional tobacco smoking during early life. There is currently no clear evidence of impact on fetal brain development, but recent research suggests that the current guidelines should be reconsidered. The safety of NRT and ENDS is increasingly being called into question. In this review, we discuss the special features (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism) of nicotine, NRT, and ENDS during pregnancy and postnatal environmental exposure. Further, we assess their impact on pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment."

Original articles were selected. The behavioral models of rodents described here capture multiple dimensions of human flavored nicotine use behaviors, including advantages and disadvantages.

However, the role of nicotine, the addictive component of all tobacco products, in the development of CVD is incompletely understood. Although increased public awareness of the harms of cigarette smoking has successfully led to a decline in its prevalence, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cig) or electronic nicotine delivery system has increased dramatically in recent years because of the perception that these products are safe. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the expression and function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the cardiovascular system and the impact of nicotine exposure on cardiovascular health, with a focus on nicotine-induced vascular dysfunction. Nicotine alters vasoreactivity through endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent mechanisms, leading to clinical manifestations in both cigarette smokers and e-cig users. In addition, nicotine induces vascular remodelling through its effects on proliferation, migration and matrix production of both vascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. The purpose of this review is to identify critical knowledge gaps regarding the effects of nicotine on the vasculature and to stimulate continued nicotine research."

Although its prevalence is decreasing in high-income countries, it has worsened globally, along with a concerning emergence of electronic-cigarette usage within the last two decades. Extensive epidemiologic and experimental evidence exists from both human and animal studies, demonstrating the detrimental long-term pulmonary outcomes in the offspring of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Even secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure to the developing lung might be as or even more harmful than firsthand smoke exposure. Furthermore, these effects are not limited only to the exposed progeny, but can also be transmitted transgenerationally. There is compelling evidence to support that the majority of the effects of perinatal smoke exposure on the developing lung, including the transgenerational transmission of asthma, is mediated by nicotine. Nicotine exposure induces cell-specific molecular changes in lungs, which offers a unique opportunity to prevent, halt, and/or reverse the resultant damage through targeted molecular interventions. Experimentally, the proposed interventions, such as administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists can not only block but also potentially reverse the perinatal nicotine exposure-induced respiratory morbidity in the exposed offspring. However, the development of a safe and effective intervention is still many years away. In the meantime, electropuncture at specific acupoints appears to be emerging as a more practical and safe physiologic approach to block the harmful pulmonary consequences of perinatal nicotine exposure."

Given that people continue smoking despite associated health risks, delivering nicotine without combustion should be considered a valuable and much less harmful way to reduce the public health burden caused by smoking. E‑cigarettes could play such a role if they were proven to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes. Although the number of clinical trials and human studies assessing the safety of e‑cigarettes is limited, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies reported on the potential harmful effects of the aerosol generated from e‑cigarettes. This article reviews the results of major clinical trials and laboratory studies with regard to cancer as well as cardiovascular and respiratory risk associated with the use of e‑cigarettes. Additionally, it also discusses the potential application of e‑cigarettes as smoking cessation tools. Most studies have indicated so far that e‑cigarettes are less harmful, but this applies only to smokers who completely switched to e‑cigarettes. In the opinion of the authors, good-quality research is crucial to establish the tolerance, safety, efficacy, and harm reduction potential of new technologies. Considering a significant role that physicians and other health providers play in helping smokers, there is an urgent need for evidence‑based guidelines and recommendations for clinical practitioners on potential benefits and risks of e‑cigarette use."

Implementation of the ban will require evidence that it would improve public health. This paper simulates the potential public health impact of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars through its impacts on smoking initiation, smoking cessation and switching to nicotine vaping products (NVPs). After calibrating an established US simulation model to reflect recent use trends in cigarette and NVP use, we extended the model to incorporate menthol and non-menthol cigarette use under a status quo scenario. Applying estimates from a recent expert elicitation on the behavioural impacts of a menthol ban, we developed a menthol ban scenario with the ban starting in 2021. We estimated the public health impact as the difference between smoking and vaping-attributable deaths and life-years lost in the status quo scenario and the menthol ban scenario from 2021 to 2060. As a result of the ban, overall smoking was estimated to decline by 15% as early as 2026 due to menthol smokers quitting both NVP and combustible use or switching to NVPs. These transitions are projected to reduce cumulative smoking and vaping-attributable deaths from 2021 to 2060 by 5% (650 000 in total) and reduce life-years lost by 8.8% (11.3 million). Sensitivity analyses showed appreciable public health benefits across different parameter specifications. Our findings strongly support the implementation of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars."

        "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its intention to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes as a strategy to promote cessation and reduce smoking-related harm. A low nicotine product standard will apply to all cigarettes on the market, including menthol cigarettes. In December 2021, the FDA approved a modified risk tobacco product application for menthol and non-menthol flavoured very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNC) from the 22nd Century Group. Notably, experimentation with menthol cigarettes is linked to smoking progression, as well as greater nicotine dependence relative to non-menthol cigarette use. If menthol VLNCs are perceived as more appealing than non-menthol VLNCs, this would indicate that some aspect of menthol may maintain smoking even in the absence of nicotine and FDA's regulatory authority to ban or restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes should apply to reduced nicotine content of cigarettes. In April 2022, the FDA announced proposed rulemaking to prohibit menthol cigarettes, however it is unclear if a menthol prohibition would apply to VLNCs. This study will recruit 172 young adult menthol smokers (with a specific subsample of n=40 sexual and gender minority young adults) and measure appeal for smoking experimental menthol and non-menthol VLNCs, and the impact of proposed product standards on tobacco product purchasing behaviour using an Experimental Tobacco Marketplace. Appeal across product standards will be assessed in a controlled laboratory and using ecological momentary assessment. The protocol was approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board (#11865). Findings will examine the effects of a reduced nicotine standard and a menthol ban on young adult smoking and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.

Twin studies have suggested a significant genetic contribution underlying most smoking behaviors (40-70% heritability estimates). Candidate gene studies of smoking phenotypes have identified several pharmacogenes implicated in nicotine's pharmacokinetics (CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2A13, FMOs, UGTs, and OCT2), and nicotine's pharmacodynamic response in the central nervous system (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as well as through the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems). Subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed the role of certain pharmacogenes through hypothesis-free approaches. Furthermore, pharmacogenes that alter the efficacy of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, including nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion, and varenicline, may also impact quitting success. In this brief review we highlight the role of pharmacogenes in smoking behaviors, such as smoking status, consumption, nicotine dependence, spontaneous quitting, and altered abstinence to pharmacotherapies; We provide examples from initial candidate gene associations and subsequent GWAS. The genes CYP2A6 and the CHRNA5-A3-B4 confer the most replicated sources of genetic variation in smoking behaviors, likely due to their importance in nicotine's pharmacology. We will also provide examples of genetic scoring approaches, and the role of rare variants in explaining a portion of the missing heritability in smoking behaviors."

Their use does not involve the combustion of tobacco and the creation of harmful combustion products; they have been seen as a \"harm reduction\" tool that may be of assistance in promoting smoking cessation. Recognition that ENDS can deliver an array of chemicals and materials with known adverse consequences has spurred more careful examination of these products. Nicotine, nitrosamines, carbonyl compounds, heavy metals, free radicals, reactive oxygen species, particulate matter, and \"emerging chemicals of concern\" are among the constituents of the heated chemical aerosol that is inhaled when ENDS are used. They raise concerns for cardiovascular and respiratory health that merit the attention of clinicians and regulatory agencies. Frequently cited concerns include evidence of disordered respiratory function, altered hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction, vascular reactivity, and enhanced thrombogenesis. The absence of evidence of the consequences of their long-term use is of additional concern. Their effectiveness as cessation aids and beneficial impact on health outcomes continue to be examined. It is important to ensure that their production and availability are thoughtfully regulated to optimise their safety and permit their use as harm reduction devices and potentially as smoking-cessation aids. It is equally vital to effectively prevent them from becoming ubiquitous consumer products with the potential to rapidly induce nicotine addiction among large numbers of youth. Clinicians should understand the nature of these products and the implications of their use."

        "abstract": "The usage of nicotine and cannabinoids has rapidly grown in popularity, leading to increased research into how they can affect people's health, both positively and negatively. Nicotine, Cannabidiol (CBD), and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have been shown to have significant effects on cytokine function and inflammatory response. This study aimed to review and summarize the current literature on the effects of nicotine and cannabinoids on cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, IFN, and TGF-β. Literature search was conducted on Medline/PubMed electronic databases utilizing the search terms \"nicotine\" OR \"cannabis\" OR \"cannabinoids\" AND \"cytokine\" AND \"inflammation\" AND \"stress\" AND \"immune\" from 11/1973 to 02/2024. THC and CBD usage have been associated with conflicting impacts on immune response, and observed to both exacerbate and inhibit inflammation. Nicotine has been shown to be generally proinflammatory with regards to cytokines. These responses have been reported to have significant effects on bodily response to inflammation-related diseases. Nicotine usage is associated with worsened outcomes for some conditions, like chronic pain, but improved outcomes for others, like arthritis. The impacts of cannabinoid usage tend to be more positive, exerting anti-inflammatory effects across a wide range of diseases. Given the widespread usage of these substances, it is important to understand the nature of their consequences on immune functions and the underlying mechanisms by which they act. This review has covered how cannabinoids and nicotine affect inflammation directly and how these effects can be attributed to the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In summary, the existing research studying the effects of cannabinoids and nicotine supports the major relationship between nicotine and cannabis use and inflammatory diseases."

        "abstract": "Hookah is a single-stemmed or multistemmed instrument for vaporizing and smoking flavored tobacco, whose smoke is passed through a water basin before inhalation. The use of hookah dates back centuries and is believed to have originated in India during the reign of Akbar the Great or the Safavid dynasty of Persia. Outside its native region, hookah smoking has gained popularity throughout the world, especially among younger people. There is generally a misconception among hookah users that it is less addictive than combustible cigarette smoking and that there is little to no nicotine content in hookah, with some even believing that certain additives impart health benefits. Although studies investigating the health hazards of hookah are rather limited, the inhaled smoke contains large quantities of nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, carboxylic compounds, and various inorganic compounds such as heavy metals, all of which are found in combustible cigarette smoking. Regular hookah use is associated with an increased risk of obstructive lung disease as well as lung cancer and malignancies of the head and neck. This narrative review summarizes the available data on the health hazards of hookah, with an emphasis on pulmonary complications. Increased knowledge and awareness of hookah smoking among healthcare providers can potentially lead to better patient education and identification of at-risk populations."

With e-cigarettes becoming more and more popular, smokers have more options other than conventional cigarettes. Under these circumstances, a comprehensive evaluation of the general safety of new tobacco and tobacco-related products, represented by e-cigarettes, to human health is necessary. In this review, we summarize the current research on potential negative impacts of e-cigarette exposure on human health. In particular, studies detailing the relationship between e-cigarettes and the digestive system are summarized, with mechanisms mainly including hepatic metabolic dysfunction, impaired gut barrier, and worsened outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although believed to be safer than traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes exert adverse effects on systemic health and induce the development of multiple diseases including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and IBD. Moreover, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes have a negative impact on the childhood development and increase the risk of arterial stiffness compared to the non-nicotine e-cigarettes. However, non-nicotine e-cigarette components have detrimental effects including promoting liver damage and metabolic disorders."

The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) indicates the rate of nicotine metabolism and is linked to smoking behaviors and responses to tobacco treatments. We conducted this study in order to investigated the relationship between nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) and kidney function. An analysis of cross-sectional data of adults was conducted using a population survey dataset (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data 2013/2018 of the United States). A weighted multivariate regression analysis was conducted to estimate the correlation between NMR and kidney function. Furthermore, we apply fitting smooth curves to make the relationship between NMR and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) more visualized. The research included a total of 16153 participants. Weighted multivariate regression analyses adjusted for possible variables showed a negative relationship between NMR and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).The β (95%CI) of the regression equation between NMR and eGFR was -2.24 (-2.92, -1.55), the trend testing showed consistent results. NMR is positively correlated with urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR), but it is not statistically significant. A stratified analysis found a negative correlation between NMR and eGFR in all age, gender and diabetes subgroups, the results were not statistically significant among Mexican Americans and other races. Notably, each unit rise in NMR corresponded to a 4.54 ml/min·1.73m² lower eGFR in diabetic participants and a 6.04 ml/min·1.73m² lower eGFR in those aged 60 and above. Our study shows that nicotine metabolite ratio is negatively associated with kidney function among most adults. It will be necessary to conduct more well-designed prospective clinical trials in order to determine the exact causal interactions between NMR and kidney function. Specific mechanisms also need to be further explored in basic experiments."

This paper presents insights from three research activities from the preparatory phase of the development of a new self-report health and functioning measure. A scoping literature review was conducted to identify the positive and negative impact of TNP use on health and functioning. Focus groups (n = 29) on risk perception and individual interviews (n = 40) on perceived dependence in people who use TNPs were reanalyzed in the context of health and functioning, and expert opinion was gathered from five key opinion leaders and five technical consultants. Triangulating the findings of the review of 97 articles, qualitative input from people who use TNPs, and expert feedback helped generate a preliminary conceptual framework including health and functioning and conceptually-related domains impacted by TNP use. Domains related to the future health and functioning measurement model include physical health signs and symptoms, general physical appearance, functioning (physical, sexual, cognitive, emotional, and social), and general health perceptions. This preliminary conceptual framework can inform future research on development and validation of new measures for assessment of overall health and functioning impact of TNPs from the consumers' perspective."

        "abstract": "Human behavior can be controlled by physical or psychological dependencies associated with addiction. One of the most insidious addictions in our society is the use of tobacco products which contain nicotine. This addiction can be associated with specific receptors in the brain that respond to the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are ligand-gated ion channels formed by the assembly of one or multiple types of nAChR receptor subunits. In this paper, we review the structure and diversity of nAChR subunits and our understanding for how different nAChR subtypes play specific roles in the phenomenon of nicotine addiction. We focus on receptors containing β2 and/or α6 subunits and the special significance of α5-containing receptors. These subtypes all have roles in regulating dopamine-mediated neurotransmission in the mesolimbic reward pathways of the brain. We also discuss the unique roles of homomeric α7 nAChR in behavioral responses to nicotine and how our knowledge of nAChR functional diversity may help guide pharmacotherapeutic approaches for treating nicotine addiction. While nicotine addiction is a truly global problem, the use of areca nut (betel) products is also a serious addiction associated with public health issues across most of South Asia, impacting as many as 600 million people. We discuss how cholinergic receptors of the brain are also involved with areca addiction and the unique challenges for dealing with addiction to this substance."

However, there was less compliance with the instruction to smoke only VLNC cigarettes in the immediate versus gradual reduction condition. The goal of this study was to test whether nicotine reduction method alters subjective ratings of VLNC cigarettes, and whether subjective ratings mediate effects of nicotine reduction method on smoking behavior, smoke exposure, dependence, and compliance. This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial conducted across 10 sites in the United States. Smokers (n = 1250) were randomized to either a control condition, or to have the nicotine content of their cigarettes reduced immediately or gradually to 0.04 mg nicotine/g of tobacco during a 20-week study period. Participants completed the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ). After Week 20, the immediate reduction group scored significantly lower than the gradual reduction group on multiple subscales of the mCEQ (ps < .001). The Satisfaction subscale of the mCEQ mediated the impact of nicotine reduction method on smoke exposure, smoking behavior, dependence, compliance, and abstinence. Other subscales also mediated a subset of these outcomes. An immediate reduction in nicotine content resulted in lower product satisfaction than a gradual reduction, suggesting that immediate reduction further reduces cigarette reward value. This study will provide the Food and Drug Administration with information about the impact of nicotine reduction method on cigarette reward value. These data suggest that an immediate reduction in nicotine content will result in greater reductions in cigarette satisfaction than a gradual reduction, and this reduction in satisfaction is related to changes in smoking behavior and dependence."

Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg nicotine for 28 days, and their hearts were isolated at end-point for assessment of myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury ex vivo. Rat heart mitochondria were also isolated from a subset of rats for analysis of mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition. Compared to the vehicle controls, rat hearts isolated from nicotine-administered rats exhibited poorer left ventricular function that worsened over the course of I/R. Coronary flow rate was also severely impaired in the nicotine groups at baseline and this worsened after I/R. Nicotine administration significantly increased mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition relative to the vehicle controls. Interestingly, pre-incubation of isolated mitochondria with ROS scavengers (superoxide dismutase and mitoTEMPO) significantly abolished nicotine-induced increase in mitochondria permeability transition in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Overall, our data showed that prolonged nicotine administration enhances myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury in rats and this is associated with mitochondrial ROS-driven increase in mitochondrial permeability transition."

However, possible interactions between oral menthol and nicotine on intake and preference remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of menthol on oral nicotine consumption. Adult Sprague Dawley female and male rats (n = 8 per group) were given a choice of water or drug solution by using two-bottle free choice paradigm for 2 weeks: vehicle (5% ethanol), nicotine (20 mg/L), menthol (1 g/L) and mentholated nicotine groups. At the end of the study, plasma nicotine levels were determined. When rats were given a choice of nicotine or water, nicotine intake was similar between female and male rats. Menthol addition to nicotine solution significantly increased nicotine intake and preference in male but not female rats without a considerable effect on total fluid intake and body weight change in either sex. The average nicotine intake in male rats was 0.5 ± 0.05 and 1.4 ± 0.12 mg/kg/day for nicotine and menthol-nicotine combination (p < .05), respectively. The average nicotine intake in female rats was 0.6 ± 0.05 and 0.6 ± 0.03 mg/kg/day for nicotine and menthol-nicotine combination (p > .05), respectively. Plasma nicotine levels were not significantly different between the groups in either male (nicotine group: 20.8 ± 4.9, mentholated nicotine group: 31.9 ± 3.2 ng/mL) or female (nicotine group: 24.0 ± 3.3, mentholated nicotine group: 17.8 ± 2.9 ng/mL) rats (p > .05).

Hookah users however are exposed to many of the same toxic compounds/by-products as cigarette users, but at dramatically higher levels, which might lead to more severe negative health effects. In fact, hookah users are at risks of infections, cancers, lung disease, and other medical conditions. Moreover, because of the overlapping toxicant/chemical profile to conventional cigarettes, hookah smoke effects on the cardiovascular system are thought to be comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. A major source of tobacco addiction is nicotine, whose levels in hookah are extremely variable as they depend on the type of tobacco used.

There is substantial evidence that adolescent e-cigarette use leads to use of combustible tobacco products. E-cigarette companies commonly advertise that e-cigarettes contain nicotine, flavoring chemicals, and humectants (propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin), but toxicants, ultrafine particles, and carcinogens have also been found in e-cigarette solutions and emissions, many of which are known to cause adverse health effects. Most major e-cigarette brands are owned by big tobacco companies that use similar marketing and advertising strategies to attract youth users as they did with traditional tobacco products. In this review, we provide an overview of e-cigarettes and vape devices with an emphasis on the impact for the pediatric population. We describe the vast array of e-cigarette devices and solutions, concern for nicotine addiction, and the scientific background on the known health harms. There are accompanying visual depictions to assist in identifying these products, including newer e-cigarette products and JUUL. Because current federal regulations are insufficient to protect youth from e-cigarette use, exposure, and nicotine addiction, there are recommendations for pediatricians and pediatric health care providers to counsel and advocate for a tobacco-free lifestyle for patients and families."

        "abstract": "Tobacco continues to kill about 0.48 million Americans per year and there are currently 34.3 million smokers in the USA. As a consequence of the First Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco in 1964, tobacco control interventions on part of the government led to a significant decline in conventional tobacco product usage over the last few decades. However, more recently, a new entity in the form of electronic cigarettes has risen rapidly and has exposed a younger population to a plethora of dangerous consequences. Looking at e-cigarettes from the perspective of tobacco control however raises a lot of challenges. There is little doubt that existing smokers of combustible cigarettes who switch to e-cigarettes will be switching to a less harmful product. However, if the younger generation begins using e-cigarettes as a result of targeted marketing, appealing flavors and 'safer alternative' perception, decades of progress made in conventional tobacco control will be negated. Governments at the federal, state, and local levels have a mandate to once again implement new public health policies to ensure that non-conventional tobacco products like e-cigarettes are available as smoking cessation tools for existing smokers but at the same time do not play a role in ruining the health of future generations through addiction and disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the present scenario of regulations and policies impacting public health with respect to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) with the objective of providing a meaningful and balanced view of the challenges at hand with plausible recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Nicotine in tobacco is known to cause addiction and dependence. It is particularly potent in children and young adults. E-cigarettes can deliver high concentrations of nicotine, and these concentrations can vary depending on the numerous constituents within the e-cigarette which vary greatly from one another. Use of e-cigarettes is implicated as a risk factor for future cigarette use in young adults. Moreover, e-cigarette usage patterns also depend on several sociodemographic factors. Banning tobacco products has shown to reduce smoking risk in youth and as such, strong e-cigarette regulation measures are needed for prevention. Effective regulation of ENDS faces a multitude of challenges. One such challenge is to prevent youth and non-smokers from getting habituated to nicotine through e-cigarettes. The intention of tobacco companies to sustain sales through harmful marketing strategies that tone down the risks and highlight e-cigarettes as a \"much safer alternative\" while promoting flavors appealing to children should be immediately prohibited. Another hazard is the endorsement of ENDS as devices meant for enhancing social interaction which opens a path for youth to make erroneous choices under peer pressure. On the other hand, several studies have reported that e-cigarettes significantly reduce an existing smoker's risk of being exposed to toxic tobacco smoke constituents that are normally present in cigarette smoke. This leads to the conclusions that e-cigarettes can be a tool for smoking cessation for current smokers. Public policy must take a multi-dimensional approach to balance these two extremes."

        "abstract": "There is a common perception that smoking generally helps people to manage stress, and may be a form of 'self-medication' in people with mental health conditions. However, there are biologically plausible reasons why smoking may worsen mental health through neuroadaptations arising from chronic smoking, leading to frequent nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression, irritability), in which case smoking cessation may help to improve rather than worsen mental health. To examine the association between tobacco smoking cessation and change in mental health. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the trial registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from 14 April 2012 to 07 January 2020. These were updated searches of a previously-conducted non-Cochrane review where searches were conducted from database inception to 13 April 2012.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included controlled before-after studies, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysed by smoking status at follow-up, and longitudinal cohort studies. In order to be eligible for inclusion studies had to recruit adults who smoked tobacco, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. They also had to measure a mental health outcome at baseline and at least six weeks later. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcomes were change in depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms or mixed anxiety and depression symptoms between baseline and follow-up. Secondary outcomes  included change in symptoms of stress, psychological quality of life, positive affect, and social impact or social quality of life, as well as new incidence of depression, anxiety, or mixed anxiety and depression disorders. We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using a modified ROBINS-I tool.  For change in mental health outcomes, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference in change in mental health from baseline to follow-up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For the incidence of psychological disorders, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. For all meta-analyses we used a generic inverse variance random-effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using I We included 102 studies representing over 169,500 participants. Sixty-two of these were identified in the updated search for this review and 40 were included in the original version of the review.  Sixty-three studies provided data on change in mental health, 10 were included in meta-analyses of incidence of mental health disorders, and 31 were synthesised narratively.  For all primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with an improvement in mental health symptoms compared with continuing to smoke: anxiety symptoms (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.13; 15 studies, 3141 participants; I Taken together, these data provide evidence that mental health does not worsen as a result of quitting smoking, and very low- to moderate-certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with small to moderate improvements in mental health.  These improvements are seen in both unselected samples and in subpopulations, including people diagnosed with mental health conditions. Additional studies that use more advanced methods to overcome time-varying confounding would strengthen the evidence in this area."

        "abstract": "Tobacco, in addition to being one of the greatest public health threats facing our world, is believed to have deleterious effects on bone metabolism and especially on bone healing. It has been described in the literature that patients who smoke are approximately twice as likely to develop a nonunion following a non-specific bone fracture. For clavicle fractures, this risk is unclear, as is the impact that such a complication might have on the initial management of these fractures. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for conservatively treated displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to 12 May 2022, with supplementary searches in Open Grey, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Google Scholar. The searches were performed without limits for publication date or languages. The meta-analysis included eight studies, 2,285 observations, and 304 events (nonunion). The random effects model predicted a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.68 (95% confidence interval 1.87 to 7.23), which can be considered significant (p = 0.003). It indicates that smoking more than triples the risk of nonunion when a fracture is treated conservatively. Smoking confers a RR of 3.68 for developing a nonunion in patients with a displaced middle third clavicle fracture treated conservatively. We know that most patients with pseudarthrosis will have pain and a poor functional outcome. Therefore, patients should be informed of the significantly higher risks of nonunion and offered smoking cessation efforts and counselling. Moreover, surgery should be considered for any patient who smokes with this type of fracture."

        "abstract": "The 2019/2020 Australian bushfires were unprecedented in terms of total area burned and impact on livestock and wildlife populations. However, there is currently limited literature available relating the consequences of bushfire or smoke exposure to livestock health, welfare, and carcase quality. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using historical monitoring data from a Meat Standards Australia (MSA) accredited abattoir located on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia. The spatiotemporal association between exposure to bushfire smoke (specifically the duration of the bushfires, distance from closest bushfire, annual bushfire season, proportion of the property of origin burned during the bushfires and time frame since exposure to bushfires) and effects on carcase meat quality metrics and pathology were measured, by building linear, generalised linear and cumulative link mixed models. Our findings indicate that hot carcase weight increased as the distance between the property of origin and the closest bushfire became greater and decreased with exposure to bushfires of longer duration or when greater proportions of the property of origin were burnt during bushfires. Subcutaneous rib fat of carcases also increased with an increasing distance of properties from the closest recorded bushfire and decreased with exposure to bushfires during the 2019/2020 season. Higher meat colour scores (darker meat colour) were associated with exposure to bushfires during the 2019/2020 season and exposure to bushfires of longer durations. There was only a weak association between increasing distance to the closest bushfire and higher marbling scores. Evidence of pneumonia in carcases was associated with exposure to bushfires of longer duration, specifically increasing risk of pneumonia was associated with fires of longer durations. Greater periods of time since exposure (i.e., >6 months) to bushfires were also associated with a higher risk of evidence of pneumonia at the time of processing. With increasing incidence of bushfires in Australia forecasted as a result of climate change, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of bushfires on livestock, to limit the effects on livestock health and mitigate the risk of significant socioeconomic impacts to the livestock industry. By providing a greater understanding of the impact of bushfires, the findings of this study can support producers to make informed decisions to mitigate the effects of bushfires on livestock health and carcase meat quality."

Thereby, this study aimed to assess the oral health status of children subjected to household smoking and the impact of smoking patterns on the severity of oral health deterioration. A total of 210 healthy children were enrolled in this case-control study and allocated into children subjected to household smoking (HS) and control groups. Participants' guardians were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and parental smoking habits. All participants were subjected to clinical dental examination to assess dental caries (ICDAS), hypomineralized primary molars (HSPM), and gingival status (GI). Stimulated saliva samples were collected to assess saliva composition and characteristics. Urine samples were collected and analyzed for cotinine concentration. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v.25) software at a test value of p ≤ 0.05. The t-student test was used to find significant differences between participants' age, gingival index score, saliva pH, flow rate, sIgA, and cotinine level. The Chi-square test was used to test for the significance of parental employment, number of rooms, gender, sweets consumption, brushing frequency, and HMPM. The correspondence analysis was used to test for significance of parents' levels of education, type of house ventilation, ICDAS score, smoking form, frequency, and smoking pattern. The correlation between cotinine level and sIgA was tested for association using Bivariate correlation test. The HS group showed a significantly increased risk for dental caries (p < 0.000), HSPM lesions (p = 0.007), and GI score (p < 0.000). A significant reduction in salivary flow rate, saliva pH, and sIgA were evident in HS group (p < 0.000). Parental consumption of more than 20 cigarettes/day was accompanied by increased dental caries activity (p < 0.000) and higher risk for increased severity of gingival inflammation (p < 0.000) of children in the HS group. Children of parents who smoke cigarettes and use the hubble/bubble anywhere in the house found to have greater distribution of HSPM (p < 0.000). Reduced sIgA values were found to be significantly associated with increased cotinine concentrations in HS children (p < 0.000). Frequent exposure to household smoking could be associated with an increased risk of dental caries progression, enamel hypomineralization, gingival inflammation, and saliva characteristics changes in children."

We meta-analysed data from up to 15,014 adults across 5 cohorts with DNA methylation measured in blood using Illumina's EPIC array for current smoking (2560 exposed), quit < 1 year (500 exposed), in utero (286 exposed), and ETS exposure (676 exposed). We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking with sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C). Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent quitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs attenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in adults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential methylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary intake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K array were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero smoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy drugs. Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with Illumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers within a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood.

Implementation of the ban will require evidence that it would improve public health. This paper simulates the potential public health impact of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars through its impacts on smoking initiation, smoking cessation and switching to nicotine vaping products (NVPs). After calibrating an established US simulation model to reflect recent use trends in cigarette and NVP use, we extended the model to incorporate menthol and non-menthol cigarette use under a status quo scenario. Applying estimates from a recent expert elicitation on the behavioural impacts of a menthol ban, we developed a menthol ban scenario with the ban starting in 2021. We estimated the public health impact as the difference between smoking and vaping-attributable deaths and life-years lost in the status quo scenario and the menthol ban scenario from 2021 to 2060. As a result of the ban, overall smoking was estimated to decline by 15% as early as 2026 due to menthol smokers quitting both NVP and combustible use or switching to NVPs. These transitions are projected to reduce cumulative smoking and vaping-attributable deaths from 2021 to 2060 by 5% (650 000 in total) and reduce life-years lost by 8.8% (11.3 million). Sensitivity analyses showed appreciable public health benefits across different parameter specifications. Our findings strongly support the implementation of a ban on menthol in cigarettes and cigars."

During the vaporization of e-liquids, toxins, carcinogens, and various other chemicals can be released and inhaled by the user. Limited data exist regarding the potential health impact of exposure to e-vapors, primarily derived from animal studies and in vitro research. The oral tissues are the first site of direct interaction with the components of the inhaled vapor.

We explored the effect of county-level SFO strength with smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence in Indiana. We obtained county-level lung cancer incidence from the Indiana State Cancer Registry and county-level characteristics from the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission's policy database between 1995 and 2016. Using generalized estimating equations, we performed multivariable analyses of smoking prevalence and age-adjusted lung cancer rates with respect to the strength of smoke-free ordinances at the county level over time. Of Indiana's 92 counties, 24 had a SFO by 2011. In 2012, Indiana enacted a state-wide SFO enforcing at least moderate level SFO protection. Mean age-adjusted lung cancer incidence per year was 76.8 per 100,000 population and mean smoking prevalence per year was 25% during the study period. Counties with comprehensive or moderate SFO had a smoking prevalence 1.2% (95% CI [-1.88, -0.52]) lower compared with counties with weak or no SFO. Counties that had comprehensive or moderate SFO also had an 8.4 (95% CI [-11.5, -5.3]) decrease in new lung cancer diagnosis per 100,000 population per year compared with counties that had weak or no SFO. Counties with stronger smoke-free air ordinances were associated with decreased smoking prevalence and fewer new lung cancer cases per year. Strengthening SFO is paramount to decreasing lung cancer incidence."

Infants exposed to environmental smoke during pregnancy or postnatally were found to have increased gut bacterial richness, particularly Firmicutes at 3 months of age, while 6-month-old infants born to smoking mothers had an increased abundance of Bacteroides and Staphylococcus. Elevated Firmicutes richness at 3 months of age was associated with elevated odds of child overweight and obesity at 1 and 3 years of age. The limited evidence to date warrants further large scale, longitudinal studies to explore the impact of maternal smoking and environmental tobacco smoke on the infant gut microbiome and its relation to child overweight."

        "abstract": "Smoke from bushfires (also known as wildfires or forest fires) has blanketed large regions of Australia during the southern hemisphere summer of 2019/2020, potentially endangering residents who breathe the polluted air. While such air pollution is known to cause respiratory irritation and damage, its effect on the brain is not well described. In this review, we aim to outline the potentially damaging effects of bushfire smoke on brain health. We also describe the composition of air pollution, including ambient particulate matter (PM) and bushfire PM, before covering the general health effects of each. The investigated entry routes for ambient PM and postulated entry routes for bushfire PM are discussed, along with epidemiological and experimental evidence of the effect of both PMs in the brain. It appears that bushfire PM may be more toxic than ambient PM, and that it may enter the brain through extrapulmonary or olfactory routes to cause inflammation and oxidative stress. Ultimately, this review highlights the desperate requirement of greater research into the effects of bushfire PM on brain health."

They are promoted as a safer alternative to combustible cigarette smoking and as an effective smoking cessation aid. E‑cigarettes are designed to provide smokers with the desired nicotine dose without burning tobacco. They contain flavoured humectants that include nicotine in concentrations of 0-36 mg/mL. Evidence suggests that e‑cigarettes are a better nicotine delivery method than combustible cigarettes and have reduced adverse general and oral health effects, compared with combustible cigarettes. However, although e‑cigarettes might be an acceptable harm-reduction strategy, the differential effects of e‑cigarettes and combustible cigarettes have been based on self-reported perceptions. In addition, a growing number of young people, who have never engaged in combustible cigarette smoking, are smoking e‑cigarettes, which may not be harmless. We analyzed peer-reviewed publications available through PubMed to summarize the effects of e‑cigarettes on oral health."

Brazil is a very fire-prone region where few studies have investigated the impact of wildfires on air quality and health. We proposed to test two hypotheses in this study: i) the wildfires in Brazil have increased the levels of air pollution and posed a health hazard in 2003-2018, and ii) the magnitude of this phenomenon depends on the type of land use and land cover (e.g., forest area, agricultural area, etc.). Satellite and ensemble models derived data were used as input in our analyses. Wildfire events were retrieved from Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), provided by NASA; air pollution data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS); meteorological variables from the ERA-Interim model; and land use/cover data were derived from pixel-based classification of Landsat satellite images by MapBiomas. We used a framework that infers the \"wildfire penalty\" by accounting for differences in linear pollutant annual trends (β) between two models to test these hypotheses. The first model was adjusted for Wildfire-related Land Use activities (WLU), considered as an adjusted model. In the second model, defined as an unadjusted model, we removed the wildfire variable (WLU). Both models were controlled by meteorological variables. We used a generalized additive approach to fit these two models. To estimate mortality associated with wildfire penalties, we applied health impact function. Our findings suggest that wildfire events between 2003 and 2018 have increased the levels of air pollution and posed a significant health hazard in Brazil, supporting our first hypothesis. For example, in the Pampa biome, we estimated an annual wildfire penalty of 0.005 μg/m"

Although some systematic reviews have shown the impact of maternal SDP on particular conditions, a systematic review examining the overall health outcomes has not been published. Hence, this paper aimed to conduct an umbrella review on this issue. A systematic review of systematic reviews (umbrella review) was conducted according to a protocol submitted to PROSPERO ( CRD42018086350 ). CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CRD Database and HMIC databases were searched to include all studies published in English by 31 December 2017, except those focusing exclusively on low-income countries. Two researchers conducted the study selection and quality assessment independently. The review included 64 studies analysing the relationship between maternal SDP and 46 health conditions. The highest increase in risks was found for sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, stillbirth, low birth weight and obesity amongst infants. The impact of SDP was associated with the number of cigarettes consumed. According to the causal link analysis, five mother-related and ten infant-related conditions had a causal link with SDP. In addition, some studies reported protective impacts of SDP on pre-eclampsia, hyperemesis gravidarum and skin defects on infants. The review identified important gaps in the literature regarding the dose-response association, exposure window, postnatal smoking. The review shows that maternal SDP is not only associated with short-term health conditions (e.g. preterm birth, oral clefts) but also some which can have life-long detrimental impacts (e.g. obesity, intellectual impairment). This umbrella review provides a comprehensive analysis of the overall health impacts of SDP. The study findings indicate that while estimating health and cost outcomes of SDP, long-term health impacts should be considered as well as short-term effects since studies not including the long-term outcomes would underestimate the magnitude of the issue. Also, interventions for pregnant women who smoke should consider the impact of reducing smoking due to health benefits on mothers and infants, and not solely cessation."

The aim is to synthesize data on the impact of passive smoking on oral health of infants, preschoolers, and children. A search was conducted across Medline (via EBSCOhost), PubMed, and Scopus up to February 2023. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The initial search produced 1221 records and after removal of duplicates, screening by title and abstract, and full-text assessment, 25 studies were eligible for review and data extraction. The majority of studies (94.4%) found a correlation between passive smoking and increased prevalence of dental caries with three studies suggesting a dose-response relationship. Prenatal passive smoking exposure in 81.8% of studies indicated an increased dental caries experience compared to postnatal exposure. Low parental education, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, oral hygiene, and gender affected the level of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and dental caries risk. The results of this systematic review strongly suggest a significant association between dental caries in the deciduous dentition and passive smoking. Early intervention and education on the effects of passive smoking on infants and children will allow for the improvement in oral health outcomes and reduction in smoking-associated systemic conditions. The results justify all health professionals paying more attention to passive smoking when conducting pediatric patient histories, contributing to improved diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning with more suitable follow-up schedules. The evidence from this review that environmental tobacco smoke and passive smoking is a risk factor for oral health conditions, both prenatally and postnatally during early childhood, justifies all health professionals paying more attention to passive smoking when conducting pediatric patient histories. Early intervention and appropriate parental education regarding the effects of secondhand smoke on infants and children will allow for the minimization of dental caries, improvement in oral health outcomes and overall reduction in smoking-associated systemic conditions for the children exposed."

The following variables were recorded: sociodemographic (age, educational level, marital status, social class, type of cohabitation, nationality), health-related habits (physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol consumption), health conditions, and medication intake. Four lifestyle habits were compared between the pre-conception and pregnancy periods: diet, physical activity, and alcohol and tobacco use. The proportion of women who consumed alcohol (42.8 % vs 3.4 %) or smoked (19.3 % vs 12.4 %) was significantly higher before conception (p < 0.01). Conversely, the proportion of inactive women was lower before pregnancy, with 23.3 % (CI95%: 18.7-27.9) formerly classified as active versus 35.3 % (CI95%: 30.2-40.5) (p < 0.01). Similarly, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased during pregnancy (62.9 % vs 75.0 %; p < 0.01). Furthermore, 53.2 % (CI95%: 47.8-58.5) of women reported a change from non-healthy to healthy in at least one of the evaluated habits. Logistic regression analyses revealed the variables associated with a positive change, which were being national Spanish (OR: 6.9) and experiencing the first pregnancy (OR: 1.8). The lifestyles of women undergo changes between the pre-gestation and pregnancy periods. However, such variations do not affect all health-related habits similarly. A positive change was observed in diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking habit, whereas pregnancy negatively impacted on physical activity and sedentary behaviours."

Rates of medical use were determined for citizens of a wildfire-affected area in the Eastern Yeongdong region and a non-affected area in the Western Yeongseo region. Logistic regression analysis was performed considering an increase in medical use per individual as a dependent variable; age, sex, income, smoking, drinking, and exercise were included as confounding variables. The odds ratio for medical use in Yeongdong region increased significantly after 3 days, 3 months, and 1 year after a fire occurred, compared with Yeongseo region. The results of this study confirmed that the use of medical care increased for residents of a wildfire-affected area, compared with those of an adjacent non-affected area.

Regulation on smoking in the workplace and public places has made the home the dominant unregulated source of ETS, with important potential impacts on children. Between 40% and 60% of cbildren in the United Kingdom are exposed to ETS in the home. Many experimental and human and studies have investigated the adverse health effects of ETS. Substantial evidence shows that in adults ETS is associated with increased risk of chronic respiratory illness, including lung cancer, nasal cancer, and cardiovascular disease. In children, ETS increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, middle ear disease, lower respiratory tract illness, prevalence of wheeze and cough, and exacerbates asthma. Although banning smoking in the home would be the optimal reduction strategy, several barrier and ventilation methods can be effective. Nevertheless, such methods are not always practical or acceptable, particularly when social pressures contribute to a lack of support for ETS control in the home. Smoking cessation interventions have bad limited success. Research is needed to explore the barriers to adopting ETS risk-reducing behaviors."

Specific mechanisms by which toxins present in smoke impair cell repair are still being researched and are of prime interest for developing more effective treatments. Current literature suggests toxins present in cigarette smoke and aerosolized e-vapor trigger abnormal intercellular responses, damage mitochondrial function, and consequently disrupt the homeostasis of the organelle's biochemical processes by increasing reactive oxidative species. Increased oxidative stress sets off a cascade of molecular events, disrupting optimal mitochondrial morphology and homeostasis. Furthermore, smoking-induced oxidative stress may also amalgamate with other health factors to contribute to various pathophysiological processes. An increasing number of studies show that toxins may affect mitochondria even through exposure to secondhand or thirdhand smoke. This review assesses the impact of toxins present in tobacco smoke and e-vapor on mitochondrial health, networking, and critical structural processes, including mitochondria fission, fusion, hyper-fusion, fragmentation, and mitophagy. The efforts are focused on discussing current evidence linking toxins present in first, second, and thirdhand smoke to mitochondrial dysfunction."

While many studies have documented the physical health harms of wildfire smoke, less is known about the effects on mental health and well-being. Understanding the effects of wildfire smoke on mental health and well-being is crucial as the world enters a time in which wildfire smoke events become more frequent and severe. We conducted a scoping review of the existing information on wildfire smoke's impact on mental health and well-being and developed a model for understanding the pathways in which wildfire smoke may contribute to mental health distress. We conducted searches using PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google, Scopus, and ProQuest for 1990-2022. These searches yielded 200 articles. Sixteen publications met inclusion criteria following screening and eligibility assessment. Three more publications from the bibliographies of these articles were included for a total of 19 publications. Our review suggests that exposure to wildfire smoke may have mental health impacts, particularly in episodes of chronic and persistent smoke events, but the evidence is inconsistent and limited. Qualitative studies disclose a wider range of impacts across multiple mental health and well-being domains. The potential pathways connecting wildfire smoke with mental health and well-being operate at multiple interacting levels including individual, social and community networks, living and working conditions, and ecological levels. Priorities for future research include: 1) applying more rigorous methods; 2) differentiating between mental illness and emotional well-being; 3) studying chronic, persistent or repeated smoke events; 4) identifying the contextual factors that set the stage for mental health and well-being effects, and 5) identifying the causal processes that link wildfire smoke to mental health and well-being effects. The pathways model can serve as a basis for further research and knowledge synthesis on this topic. Also, it helps public health, community mental health, and emergency management practitioners mitigate the mental health and well-being harms of wildfire smoke."

While research has begun to measure disparities, there is a gap in examining wildfire-specific disasters. To address this gap, this scoping review analyzed literature to explore the nexus of wildfires and older adults. We searched peer-reviewed literature using the following inclusion criteria: (1) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) available in English; (3) examines at least one topic related to wildfires; and (4) examines how criterion three relates to older adults in at least one way. Authors screened 261 titles and abstracts and 138 were reviewed in full, with 75 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Findings heavily focused on health impacts of wildfires on older adults, particularly of smoke exposure and air quality. While many articles mentioned a need for community-engaged responses that incorporate the needs of older adults, few addressed firsthand experiences of older adults. Other common topics included problems with evacuation, general health impacts, and Indigenous elders' fire knowledge. Further research is needed at the nexus of wildfires and older adults to highlight both vulnerabilities and needs as well as the unique experience and knowledge of older adults to inform wildfire response strategies and tactics."

Legalization of cannabis may facilitate use in the college population, with 38% of college students, whose brains are still maturing, regularly using marijuana products. Earlier and increased use, higher potency, pre-existing issues, and genetic predispositions increase negative outcomes by precipitating or worsening mental illness and ultimately impacting academic success. In the USA, the sharpest increase in cannabis users following legalization has been in the college age population (18-25 years of age). This population is especially vulnerable to the negative impacts and risks associated with cannabis use, including risk for the onset of major psychiatric illness. College mental health practitioners should remain informed about health effects of cannabis use, assess patient use on a regular basis, provide education and be familiar with interventions to reduce harm."

While mounting evidence exists regarding an array of associated adverse health effects, to date limited evidence exists regarding the health effects of e-cigarette use on cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD). The present review summarizes the effects of e-cigarette use on CV health. A search strategy of in vivo experimental, observational studies (including population-based cohort studies), and interventional studies was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science (April 1, 2009-April 1, 2022). The main findings revealed that the influence of e-cigarette on health are attributed mainly to the individual and interactive effects of flavors and additives used in e-cigarette fluids, along with the extended heating. The above collectively stimulate prolonged sympathoexcitatory CV autonomic effects, such as increased heart rate and diastolic blood pressure (BP), as well as decreased oxygen saturation. Hence, e-cigarette users are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Such risks are anticipated to increase, especially among the young who are increasingly adopting e-cigarette use particularly with flavored additives. Further investigations are urgently needed to evaluate the long-term effects of e-cigarette use, particularly among susceptible population groups such as youth."

Few studies have explored the association between parental smoking and adolescent's health-promoting behaviors. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of SHS and the relationship between parental smoking at home and adolescent's health-promoting behaviors in rural areas. A school-based and cross-sectional study was conducted from March to December 2019 in western coastal Yunlin County, Taiwan. A total of 1227 adolescents, including 51% boys, anonymously participated in this study. Three parental smoking situations and eight questions of adolescents' habits extracted from previous studies were applied. A linear regression model was used to analyze the factors associated with adopting health-promoting behaviors. More than half (67.7%) of adolescents experienced parental smoking at home, 90.2% reported their family smoked around them, and 48.8% of participants \"sometimes\" or \"never\" avoided SHS. Many participants showed a low frequency of water (49.6%), vegetable (49.1%), and fruit (63.2%) intake, using dental floss (84.7%), and regular exercise (60.6%). The determinants of adolescents' health-promoting scores were highly associated with avoidance of SHS, less associated with parental smoking, and parents smoking at home and around adolescents. The findings showed that in the rural area, a high prevalence of parental smoking at home and parental smoking around adolescents was noted. It is an important issue that parental smoking was negatively associated with adolescent's health-promoting behaviors."

        "abstract": "Many lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity and cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary diseases, are associated with chronic systemic inflammation, which has been shown to contribute to the disease initiation and progression, and also for co-morbidities of these diseases. While the source of inflammation in obese subjects is suggested to be mainly the visceral adipose tissue, smoke-induced inflammation originates in the pulmonary system. Here, chronic cigarette smoking induces oxidative stress, resulting in severe cellular damage. During obesity, metabolic stress pathways in adipocytes induce inflammatory cascades which are also accompanied by fibrotic processes and insulin resistance. In both diseases, local inflammatory signals induce progressive immune cell infiltration, release of cytokines and a subsequent spill-over of inflammation to the systemic circulation. Exercise training represents an effective therapeutic and immune regulating strategy for both obese patients, as well as for patients with smoke induced pulmonary inflammation. While the immuneregulating impact of exercise might primarily depend on the disease state, patients with pulmonary inflammation seem to be less responsive to exercise therapy. The current review tries to identify similarities and differences between inflammatory processes, and the consequences for the immunoregulatory effects of exercise as a therapeutic agent."

Mais il existe peu de données rdatives à l’impact du fait de fumer sur le résultat du traitement de la TB comme les pertes de vue et la conversion de culture. Cette méta analyse a évalué les données actuelles relatives à l’impact du tabagisme actif sur les résultats du traitement de la TB. Les articles en langue anglaise publiés du début de la base de données jusqu’en 2017 ont été recherchés sur PubMed, Scopus, Embase et la Cochrane Library. Les articles abordant la TB pulmonaire active et la consommation de cigarettes ont été identifiés et les données résumées. Les fumeurs ont été définis comme ceux qui fumaient chaque jour ou certains jours au moment de l’entretienldu diagnostic. Les non-fumeurs ne fumaient pas au moment de l’entretienldu diagnostic. Les résultats défavorables ont indus tous les résultats autres que la guérison ou l’achévement du traitement de TB. Trois ensembles de données différents ont été examinés : 8 articles abordant les résultats defavorables du traitement, 9 analysant seulement les pertes de vue et 5 abordant le retard de la conversion du frottis ou de la culture. Les études comprenant moins de 20 sujets ou consacrées seulement à des populations ayant des comorbidités ont été exclues. Nous avons identifié 1030 études ; 21 études ont rempli les critères d’inclusionlexclusion. Les fumeurs ont eu des risques plus élevés de résultats défavorables (odds ratio combinés [pOR] 1,23; IC95% 1,14–1,33), retard de conversion du frottis ou de la culture (pOR 1,55; IC95% 1,04–2,07), et pertes de vue (pOR 1,35; IC95% 1,21–1,50). Le fait de fumer des cigarettes est associé à un résultat négatif du traitement et à un retard de conversion du frottis ou de la culture, suggérant qu’il s’agit d’un facteur important dont il faut tenir compte dans les activités d’étimination de la TB. El consumo de cigarrillos es uno de los factores que modifican las características epidemiológicas de la tuberculosis (TB). Sin embargo, se cuenta con poca evidencia sobre la influencia del tabaquismo en los desenlaces terapéuticos de la enfermedad como Ia pérdida durante el seguimiento y la conversión dd cultivo. En el presente metanàlisis se evaluó la evidencia existente sobre el efecto del tabaquismo activo en los desenlaces del tratamiento antituberculoso. Se realizó una búsqueda en las bases de datos PubMed, Scopus, Embase y la biblioteca Cochrane de artículos en inglés publicados desde el inicio de las rnismas hasta el 2017. Se escogieron los artículos que abordaban la TB pulmonar activa y el consumo de cigarrillos y se extrajeron los datos. Se definió como fumador la persona que fumaba todos los días o algunos días en el momento de la entrevista o del diagnóstic. Los no fumadores, no fumaban en el momento de la entrevista o del diagnóstico. Los desenlaces desfavorables incluyeron todo desenlace diferente de la curación o la compleción del tratamiento antituberculoso. Se analizaron tres conjuntos de datos, a saber: ocho artículos que examinaban los desenlaces desfavorables, nueve que abordaban solo la pérdida durante el seguimiento y 15 artículos que examinaban el retraso de conversión de la baciloscopia o el cultivo. Se excluyeron los estudios que contaban con menos de 20 participantes o que solo analizaban poblaciones con enfermedades concomitantes. Se encontraron 1030 estudios; 21 satisfacían los criterios de inclusión y exclusión. En los fumadores era mayor la probabilidad de un desenlace desfavorable (OR combinado [ORp] 1,23; IC95% 1,14–1,33), un retraso en la conversión de la baciloscopia o el cultivo (ORp 1,55; IC95% 1,04–2,07) y la pérdida durante el seguimiento del tratamiento (ORc 1,35; IC95% 1,21–1,50). El consumo de cigarrillos se asoció con resultados desfavorables del tratamiento y retrasos en la conversión a una baciloscopia o un cultivo negativos, lo cual indica que el tabaquismo es un aspecto importante que debe tenerse en cuenta en las iniciativas de eliminación de la TB."

The objectives of this review were to describe the incidence and/or prevalence of IBD in the era of advanced therapies, and to describe the association between environmental risk factors and both pathogenesis and disease course across the ages. We performed a search of English language publications listed in PubMed regarding the epidemiology of IBD and key environmental factors implicated in IBD from January 2000 to December 2023. Annual incidence rates varied by geographical region with IBD estimates ranging from 10.5 to 46.14 per 100 000 in Europe, 1.37 to 1.5 per 100 000 in Asia and the Middle East, 23.67 to 39.8 per 100 000 in Oceania, 0.21 to 3.67 per 100 000 in South America, and 7.3 to 30.2 per 100 000 in North America. The burden of IBD among children and adolescents, and older people is rising globally. Key environmental factors implicated in IBD pathogenesis include exposure to tobacco smoking, antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, infections, and ultra-high processed foods. Breastfeeding and a high-quality diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish, and other fibre sources are important protective factors. Smoking has consistently been shown to negatively impact disease outcomes for Crohn's disease. The epidemiology of IBD has undergone considerable change in recent decades, with an increase in the burden of disease worldwide. Optimally studying and targeting environmental triggers in IBD may offer future opportunities for disease modification."

Vaping has grown in popularity over the past decade, in part propelled by innovations in vape pen design and nicotine flavoring. Teens and young adults have seen the biggest uptake in use of vape pens, which have superseded conventional cigarettes as the preferred modality of nicotine consumption. Relatively little is known, however, about the potential effects of chronic vaping on the respiratory system. Further, the role of vaping as a tool of smoking cessation and tobacco harm reduction remains controversial. The 2019 E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) outbreak highlighted the potential harms of vaping, and the consequences of long term use remain unknown. Here, we review the growing body of literature investigating the impacts of vaping on respiratory health. We review the clinical manifestations of vaping related lung injury, including the EVALI outbreak, as well as the effects of chronic vaping on respiratory health and covid-19 outcomes. We conclude that vaping is not without risk, and that further investigation is required to establish clear public policy guidance and regulation."

Evidence suggests that air pollution has a negative impact on asthma outcomes in both adult and pediatric populations. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the effect of various outdoor and indoor pollutants on asthma outcomes, their burden on its management, as well as to highlight the measures that could result in improved asthma outcomes. Traffic-related air pollution, nitrogen dioxide and second-hand smoking (SHS) exposures represent significant risk factors for asthma development in children. Nevertheless, a causal relation between air pollution and development of adult asthma is not clearly established. Exposure to outdoor pollutants can induce asthma symptoms, exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Active tobacco smoking is associated with poorer asthma control, while exposure to SHS increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, respiratory symptoms and healthcare utilization. Other indoor pollutants such as heating sources and molds can also negatively impact the course of asthma. Global measures, that aim to reduce exposure to air pollutants, are highly needed in order to improve the outcomes and management of adult and pediatric asthma in addition to the existing guidelines."

Umbrella review: eight major independent reviews published 2017-2021. Systematic review: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO (articles published July 2017 - July 2020 and not included in NASEM review). Four hundred eligible publications were included in our synthesis: 112 from the NASEM review, 189 from our top-up review search, and 99 further publications cited by other reviews. There is conclusive evidence linking e-cigarette use with poisoning, immediate inhalation toxicity (including seizures), and e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI; largely but not exclusively for e-liquids containing tetrahydrocannabinol and vitamin E acetate), as well as for malfunctioning devices causing injuries and burns. Environmental effects include waste, fires, and generation of indoor airborne particulate matter (substantial to conclusive evidence). There is substantial evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes can cause dependence or addiction in non-smokers, and strong evidence that young non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are more likely than non-users to initiate smoking and to become regular smokers. There is limited evidence that freebase nicotine e-cigarettes used with clinical support are efficacious aids for smoking cessation. Evidence regarding effects on other clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, development, and mental and reproductive health, is insufficient or unavailable. E-cigarettes can be harmful to health, particularly for non-smokers and children, adolescents, and young adults. Their effects on many important health outcomes are uncertain. E-cigarettes may be beneficial for smokers who use them to completely and promptly quit smoking, but they are not currently approved smoking cessation aids. Better quality evidence is needed regarding the health impact of e-cigarette use, their safety and efficacy for smoking cessation, and effective regulation.

Airway irritation, mucus hypersecretion, and inflammatory response, including systemic changes, have been observed after the exposure to e-cigarettes, leading to an increase in respiratory symptoms and changes in respiratory function and the host defense mechanisms. E-cigarette has been linked with an increase of symptoms in individuals with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the major concerns in public health is the rise in e-cigarette experimentation among never-smokers, especially children and adolescents, which leads to nicotine addiction and increases the chances of becoming with time a conventional smoker. There is an urgent need to regulate e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems, at least with the same restrictions to those applied to tobacco products, and not to consider them as harmless products."

        "abstract": "The tobacco epidemic has been one of the biggest public health threats, and smoking is one of the world's largest preventable causes of premature death. An estimated 15.4% of all deaths in the world are attributable to tobacco smoking. The present review aims to describe addiction to tobacco smoking and vaping. Tobacco and vaping devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug, which explains why smoking is so prevalent and persistent. Electronic cigarettes are a group of novel nicotine or tobacco products that have rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Electronic cigarette devices allow for the use of other drugs, including THC, while the lax regulation may allow for the introduction of toxic compounds that can lead to acute or subacute toxicity, such as the e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury that has been linked to vitamin E acetate. In addition, regular vapers and heated tobacco devices emit toxins, although at lower concentrations than burned tobacco. However, more and more side effects have been identified. No new effective treatment for nicotine addiction has been developed recently, despite its huge adverse impact on overall health and other outcomes. As for the primary line of medications, the last one started in 2006, the varenicline, demonstrating a low interest in developing new medications against smoking, an unacceptable state of affairs, given the huge impact of smoking on morbidity and mortality."

        "abstract": "An estimated 58 million people have survived tuberculosis since 2000, yet many of them will suffer from post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD). PTLD results from a complex interplay between organism, host, and environmental factors and affects long-term respiratory health. PTLD is an overlapping spectrum of disorders that affects large and small airways (bronchiectasis and obstructive lung disease), lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature, and pleura and may be complicated by co-infection and haemoptysis. People affected by PTLD have shortened life expectancy and increased risk of recurrent tuberculosis, but predictors of long-term outcomes are not known. No data are available on PTLD in children and on impact throughout the life course. Risk-factors for PTLD include multiple episodes of tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis, delays in diagnosis, and possibly smoking. Due to a lack of controlled trials in this population, no evidence-based recommendations for the investigation and management of PTLD are currently available. Empirical expert opinion advocates pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and vaccinations (pneumococcal and influenza). Exacerbations in PTLD remain both poorly understood and under-recognised. Among people with PTLD, the probability of tuberculosis recurrence must be balanced against other causes of symptom worsening. Unnecessary courses of repeated empiric anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy should be avoided. PTLD is an important contributor to the global burden of chronic lung disease. Advocacy is needed to increase recognition for PTLD and its associated economic, social, and psychological consequences and to better understand how PTLD sequelae could be mitigated. Research is urgently needed to inform policy to guide clinical decision-making and preventative strategies for PTLD."

        "abstract": "Whether the positive associations of smoking and alcohol consumption with gastrointestinal diseases are causal is uncertain. We conducted this Mendelian randomization (MR) to comprehensively examine associations of smoking and alcohol consumption with common gastrointestinal diseases. Genetic variants associated with smoking initiation and alcohol consumption at the genome-wide significance level were selected as instrumental variables. Genetic associations with 24 gastrointestinal diseases were obtained from the UK Biobank, FinnGen study, and other large consortia. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were conducted to estimate the overall and independent MR associations after mutual adjustment for genetic liability to smoking and alcohol consumption. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was associated with increased risk of 20 of 24 gastrointestinal diseases, including 7 upper gastrointestinal diseases (gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal cancer, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer), 4 lower gastrointestinal diseases (irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis), 8 hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver cancer, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and acute and chronic pancreatitis), and acute appendicitis. Fifteen out of 20 associations persisted after adjusting for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Genetically predicted higher alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of duodenal ulcer, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis; however, the association for duodenal ulcer did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for genetic predisposition to smoking initiation. This study provides MR evidence supporting causal associations of smoking with a broad range of gastrointestinal diseases, whereas alcohol consumption was associated with only a few gastrointestinal diseases. The Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Hunan Province; the Swedish Heart Lung Foundation; the Swedish Research Council; the Swedish Cancer Society. People who smoke cigarettes or drink large amounts of alcohol are more likely to develop disorders with their digestive system. But it is difficult to prove that heavy drinking or smoking is the primary cause of these gastrointestinal diseases. For example, it is possible that having a digestive disorder makes people more likely to take up these habits to reduce pain or discomfort caused by the illness (an effect known as reverse causation). The association may also be the result of confounding factors, such as age or diet, which contribute to digestive problems as well as the health outcomes of smoking and drinking. Additionally, many people who smoke also drink alcohol and vice versa, making it challenging to determine if one or both behaviors contribute to the disease. One solution is to employ Mendelian randomization which uses genetics to determine if two variables are linked. Using this statistical approach, Yuan, Chen, Ruan et al. investigated if people who display genetic variants that predispose someone to becoming a smoker or drinker are at greater risk of developing certain digestive disorders. This reduces the possibility of confounding and reverse causation, as any association between genetic variants will have been present since birth, and will have not been impacted by external factors. Yuan, Chen, Ruan et al. used data from two studies that had collected the genetic and health information of thousands of people living in the United Kingdom or Finland. The analyses revealed that genetic variants associated with cigarette smoking increase the risk of 20 of the 24 gastrointestinal diseases investigated. This risk persisted for most of the disorders, even after adjusting for genes linked with alcohol consumption. Further analysis showed that genetic variants linked to heavy drinking increase the risk of duodenal ulcer, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis. However, accounting for smoking-linked genes eliminated the relationship with duodenal ulcer. These findings suggest that smoking has detrimental effects on gastrointestinal health. Reducing the number of people who start smoking or encouraging smokers to quit may help prevent digestive diseases. Even though there were fewer associations between heavy alcohol consumption and gastrointestinal illness, further studies are needed to investigate this relationship in more depth."

Importantly, recent data by the World Health Organizations (WHO) indicate that in the last two decades global tobacco use has significantly dropped, which was largely driven by decreased numbers of female smokers. Despite such advances, the use of e-cigarettes and waterpipes (shisha, hookah, narghile) is an emerging trend, especially among younger generations. There is growing body of evidence that e-cigarettes are not a harm-free alternative to tobacco cigarettes and there is considerable debate as to whether e-cigarettes are saving smokers or generating new addicts. Here, we provide an updated overview of the impact of tobacco/waterpipe (shisha) smoking and e-cigarette vaping on endothelial function, a biomarker for early, subclinical, atherosclerosis from human and animal studies. Also their emerging adverse effects on the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and the circadian clock are summarized. We briefly discuss heat-not-burn tobacco products and their cardiovascular health effects. We discuss the impact of the toxic constituents of these products on endothelial function and subsequent CVD and we also provide an update on current recommendations, regulation and advertising with focus on the USA and Europe. As outlined by the WHO, tobacco cigarette, waterpipe, and e-cigarette smoking/vaping may contribute to an increased burden of symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to severe health consequences."

The misperception of hookah being less harmful than cigarettes and the availability of different but \"appealing\" flavors are considered among the main reasons for this trend. Hookah users however are exposed to many of the same toxic compounds/by-products as cigarette users, but at dramatically higher levels, which might lead to more severe negative health effects. In fact, hookah users are at risks of infections, cancers, lung disease, and other medical conditions. Moreover, because of the overlapping toxicant/chemical profile to conventional cigarettes, hookah smoke effects on the cardiovascular system are thought to be comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. A major source of tobacco addiction is nicotine, whose levels in hookah are extremely variable as they depend on the type of tobacco used. Taken together, in this review of literature, we will provide insights on the negative health effects of hookah in general, with a focus on what is known regarding its impact on the cardiovascular system."

We review the research on the effects of e-cigarettes on multiple physiological systems, examine the association between e-cigarette use and combustible cigarette uptake and cessation, and highlight research necessary to build consensus. Although the levels of known toxicants and carcinogens tend to be significantly lower in e-cigarettes than in combustible cigarette smoke, toxicants in e-cigarette e-liquid and those that form as part of the vaporization process may produce adverse health consequences in their own right. Acute effects have been noted in the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and immune systems, which highlight the need for research on long-term exposure. The specific chemical constituents and the levels of those constituents that pose harm remain largely uncharacterized. In addition, the efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation has yet to be established. As the e-cigarette has evolved rapidly, so has the methodology across studies, making cross-study comparisons more difficult to synthesize. The latest generation of e-cigarette devices deliver nicotine and toxicants at higher levels than earlier devices, especially in experienced users. E-cigarettes pose a risk for nicotine exposure, dependence, and combustible cigarette uptake. E-cigarettes and their delivered toxicants appear harmful to multiple organ systems, although the current body of evidence is limited, especially in terms of long-term effects. Further research is warranted with a focus on individual devices, e-liquid constituents, user characteristics, and patterns of use. Any potential benefit of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation must be weighed against the risks. Given the potential longer-term effects, efforts to prevent e-cigarette use in youth are critical."

HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2α, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence. Research seems to be necessary to assess the frequency of HTP use and its potential negative health effects."

        "abstract": "The diminished perception of the health risks associated with the consumption of cannabis (marijuana) lead to a progressive increase in its inhalational use in many countries. Cannabis can be smoked through the use of joints, spliffs and blunts, and it can be vaporised with the use of hookah or e-cigarettes. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis smoke but contains numerous other substances. While the recreational use of cannabis smoking has been legalised in several countries, its health consequences have been underestimated and undervalued. The purpose of this review is to critically review the impact of cannabis smoke on the respiratory system. Cannabis smoke irritates the bronchial tree and is strongly associated with symptoms of chronic bronchitis, with histological signs of airway inflammation and remodelling. Altered fungicidal and antibacterial activity of alveolar macrophages, with greater susceptibility to respiratory infections, is also reported. The association with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised subjects is particularly concerning. Although cannabis has been shown to produce a rapid bronchodilator effect, its chronic use is associated with poor control of asthma by numerous studies. Cannabis smoking also represents a risk factor for the development of bullous lung disease, spontaneous pneumothorax and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. On the other hand, no association with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was found. Finally, a growing number of studies report an independent association of cannabis smoking with the development of lung cancer. In conclusion, unequivocal evidence established that cannabis smoking is harmful to the respiratory system. Cannabis smoking has a wide range of negative effects on respiratory symptoms in both healthy subjects and patients with chronic lung disease. Given that the most common and cheapest way of assumption of cannabis is by smoking, healthcare providers should be prepared to provide counselling on cannabis smoking cessation and inform the public and decision-makers."

These mucosal tissues bear commonalities in embryology, structure and physiology. Inherent similarities in immune responses at the two sites, as well as overlapping environmental risk factors, help to explain the increase in prevalence of IBD amongst COPD patients. Over the past decade, a tremendous amount of research has been conducted to define the microbiological makeup of the intestine, known as the intestinal microbiota, and determine its contribution to health and disease. Intestinal microbial dysbiosis is now known to be associated with IBD where it impacts upon intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and leads to augmented immune responses and the perpetuation of chronic inflammation. While much less is known about the lung microbiota, like the intestine, it has its own distinct, diverse microflora, with dysbiosis being reported in respiratory disease settings such as COPD. Recent research has begun to delineate the interaction or crosstalk between the lung and the intestine and how this may influence, or be influenced by, the microbiota. It is now known that microbial products and metabolites can be transferred from the intestine to the lung via the bloodstream, providing a mechanism for communication. While recent studies indicate that intestinal microbiota can influence respiratory health, intestinal dysbiosis in COPD has not yet been described although it is anticipated since factors that lead to dysbiosis are similarly associated with COPD. This review will focus on the gut-lung axis in the context of IBD and COPD, highlighting the role of environmental and genetic factors and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on chronic inflammation in the intestinal tract and lung."

However, SPLC risk factors have not been established and the impact of tobacco smoking remains controversial. We examined the risk factors for SPLC across multiple epidemiologic cohorts and evaluated the impact of smoking cessation on reducing SPLC risk. We analyzed data from 7059 participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) diagnosed with an initial primary lung cancer (IPLC) between 1993 and 2017. Cause-specific proportional hazards models estimated SPLC risk. We conducted validation studies using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (N = 3423 IPLC cases) and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (N = 4731 IPLC cases) cohorts and pooled the SPLC risk estimates using random effects meta-analysis. Overall, 163 MEC cases (2.3%) developed SPLC. Smoking pack-years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18 per 10 pack-years, p < 0.001) and smoking intensity (HR = 1.30 per 10 cigarettes per day, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased SPLC risk.

Additional strategies for SPLC surveillance and screening are warranted."

E-cigarettes have been presented as safer alternatives to combustion cigarettes that can mitigate the harm associated with tobacco products; however, the degree to which e-cigarette use itself can lead to morbidity and mortality is not fully defined. Herein we describe how e-cigarettes function; discuss the current knowledge of the effects of e-cigarette aerosol on lung cell cytotoxicity, inflammation, antipathogen immune response, mucociliary clearance, oxidative stress, DNA damage, carcinogenesis, matrix remodelling and airway hyperresponsiveness; and summarise the impact on lung diseases, including COPD, respiratory infection, lung cancer and asthma. We highlight how the inclusion of nicotine or flavouring compounds in e-liquids can impact lung toxicity. Finally, we consider the paradox of the safer cigarette: the toxicities of e-cigarettes that can mitigate their potential to serve as a harm reduction tool in the fight against traditional cigarettes, and we summarise the research needed in this underinvestigated area."

The United States and China have distinct and diverse populations and geographic environmental exposures that contribute to unique patterns of lung cancer incidence and mortality. In this paper, the authors compare trends of incidence and mortality of lung cancer in the US and China, and the impact on lung cancer screening programs in the two countries. It is worth noting that the mortality of lung cancer in the US has decreased gradually while in China it is still increasing over recent years. While decreasing smoking prevalence and the impact of clean air legislation have helped to mitigate the trend in the US relative to China, the increasingly widespread implementation of lung cancer chest CT screening is expected to impact lung cancer incidence and mortality in both countries. Currently there are few studies to compare the environmental and genetic risk factors for US and Chinese populations with regards to lung cancer incidence and mortality. The authors discuss the impact of gender and exposure risks, mainly smoking and environmental pollutants. Of high importance is the incidence of lung cancer in never smokers that is significantly higher in China than in the United States; this is particularly notable in women. These data suggest inclusion of ambient air pollution exposure and gender into lung cancer risk prognostic models to better capture high-risk individuals, especially for non-smoking women."

While electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been advocated as harm reduction alternatives to tobacco products, recent studies have revealed potential detrimental effects, highlighting the urgent need for further research into the molecular and health impacts of e-cigarettes. Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to dissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or e-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, cervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and indirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci [cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG)] clustered into four functional groups, including detoxification or growth signaling, based on cell type and anatomic site. Loci hypermethylated in buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with NOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor receptor signaling also exhibited elevated methylation in cancer tissue and progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and hypermethylation of these sites predicted lung cancer development in buccal samples collected from smokers up to 22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a potential role in driving carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also hypermethylated in e-cigarette users with a limited smoking history. This study sheds light on the cell type-specific changes to the epigenetic landscape induced by smoking-related products. The use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes elicits cell- and exposure-specific epigenetic effects that are predictive of carcinogenesis, suggesting caution when broadly recommending e-cigarettes as aids for smoking cessation."

Seventeen healthy subjects inhaled electronic cigarette aerosol with and without nicotine on two separate occasions in a double-blinded crossover fashion. Blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis were assessed at baseline, and then at 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h following exposure. Dynamic spirometry and impulse oscillometry were measured following vascular assessments at these time points, as well as at 6 h following exposure. e-Cigarette aerosol with nicotine caused a significant increase in heart rate and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, e-cigarette aerosol-containing nicotine caused a sudden increase in flow resistance as measured by impulse oscillometry, indicating obstruction of the conducting airways. Both aerosols caused an increase in blood pressure. The present study indicates that inhaled e-cigarette aerosol with nicotine has an acute impact on vascular and pulmonary function. Thus, chronic usage may lead to long-term adverse health effects. Further investigation is warranted."

Given the devastating impact that COVID-19 can have on the lung, it is natural to fear for patients with underlying COPD. Estimating their excess risk for contracting COVID-19 and, in particular, its more severe respiratory manifestations has been a challenging exercise in this pandemic for various reasons. First, the reporting on cases has concentrated on hospitalised and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, rather than on mild, outpatient cases. This is in part also due to the variability in testing strategies across the world, where some nations with stricter testing requirements and scarce testing resources have focused on testing only those requiring hospitalisation."

        "abstract": "In 2020, 32.6% of the world's population used tobacco. Smoking contributes to many illnesses that require hospitalisation. A hospital admission may prompt a quit attempt. Initiating smoking cessation treatment, such as pharmacotherapy and/or counselling, in hospitals may be an effective preventive health strategy. Pharmacotherapies work to reduce withdrawal/craving and counselling provides behavioural skills for quitting smoking. This review updates the evidence on interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients, to understand the most effective smoking cessation treatment methods for hospitalised smokers. To assess the effects of any type of smoking cessation programme for patients admitted to an acute care hospital. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 7 September 2022. We included randomised and quasi-randomised studies of behavioural, pharmacological or multicomponent interventions to help patients admitted to hospital quit. Interventions had to start in the hospital (including at discharge), and people had to have smoked within the last month. We excluded studies in psychiatric, substance and rehabilitation centres, as well as studies that did not measure abstinence at six months or longer. We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was abstinence from smoking assessed at least six months after discharge or the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, preferring biochemically-validated rates where reported. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We included 82 studies (74 RCTs) that included 42,273 participants in the review (71 studies, 37,237 participants included in the meta-analyses); 36 studies are new to this update. We rated 10 studies as being at low risk of bias overall (low risk in all domains assessed), 48 at high risk of bias overall (high risk in at least one domain), and the remaining 24 at unclear risk. Cessation counselling versus no counselling, grouped by intensity of intervention Hospitalised patients who received smoking cessation counselling that began in the hospital and continued for more than a month after discharge had higher quit rates than patients who received no counselling in the hospital or following hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.49; 28 studies, 8234 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might account for an additional 76 quitters in every 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 103). The evidence was uncertain (very low-certainty) about the effects of counselling interventions of less intensity or shorter duration (in-hospital only counselling ≤ 15 minutes: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.89; 2 studies, 1417 participants; and in-hospital contact plus follow-up counselling support for ≤ 1 month: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20; 7 studies, 4627 participants) versus no counselling. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that smoking cessation counselling for at least 15 minutes in the hospital without post-discharge support led to higher quit rates than no counselling in the hospital (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.58; 12 studies, 4432 participants). Pharmacotherapy versus placebo or no pharmacotherapy Nicotine replacement therapy helped more patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67; 8 studies, 3838 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 62 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 9 to 126). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision (as CI encompassed the possibility of no difference), that varenicline helped more hospitalised patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 4 studies, 829 participants). Evidence for bupropion was low-certainty; the point estimate indicated a modest benefit at best, but CIs were wide and incorporated clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.43, 4 studies, 872 participants). Hospital-only intervention versus intervention that continues after hospital discharge Patients offered both smoking cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge had higher quit rates than patients offered counselling in hospital but not offered post-discharge support (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38; 7 studies, 5610 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 34 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 to 55). Post-discharge interventions offering real-time counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.60, 8 studies, 2299 participants; low certainty-evidence) and those offering unscheduled counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 2 studies, 1598 participants; very low-certainty evidence) may have little to no effect on quit rates compared to control. Telephone quitlines versus control To provide post-discharge support, hospitals may refer patients to community-based telephone quitlines. Both comparisons relating to these interventions had wide CIs encompassing both possible harm and possible benefit, and were judged to be of very low certainty due to imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias (post-discharge telephone counselling versus quitline referral: RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.51; 3 studies, 3260 participants; quitline referral versus control: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.96; 2 studies, 1870 participants). Offering hospitalised patients smoking cessation counselling beginning in hospital and continuing for over one month after discharge increases quit rates, compared to no hospital intervention. Counselling provided only in hospital, without post-discharge support, may have a modest impact on quit rates, but evidence is less certain. When all patients receive counselling in the hospital, high-certainty evidence indicates that providing both counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge increases quit rates compared to no post-discharge intervention. Starting nicotine replacement or varenicline in hospitalised patients helps more patients to quit smoking than a placebo or no medication, though evidence for varenicline is only moderate-certainty due to imprecision. There is less evidence of benefit for bupropion in this setting. Some of our evidence was limited by imprecision (bupropion versus placebo and varenicline versus placebo), risk of bias, and inconsistency related to heterogeneity. Future research is needed to identify effective strategies to implement, disseminate, and sustain interventions, and to ensure cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy initiated in the hospital is sustained after discharge."

        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "Despite a gradual decline in smoking rates over time, exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) continues to cause harm to nonsmokers, who are disproportionately children and women living in low- and middle-income countries. We comprehensively reviewed the literature published by July 2022 concerning the adverse impacts of SHS exposure on nine health outcomes. Following, we quantified each exposure-response association accounting for various sources of uncertainty and evaluated the strength of the evidence supporting our analyses using the Burden of Proof Risk Function methodology. We found all nine health outcomes to be associated with SHS exposure. We conservatively estimated that SHS increases the risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and lung cancer by at least around 8%, 5%, 1% and 1%, respectively, with the evidence supporting these harmful associations rated as weak (two stars). The evidence supporting the harmful associations between SHS and otitis media, asthma, lower respiratory infections, breast cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was weaker (one star). Despite the weak underlying evidence for these associations, our results reinforce the harmful effects of SHS on health and the need to prioritize advancing efforts to reduce active and passive smoking through a combination of public health policies and education initiatives."

        "abstract": "This article reviews the published studies dealing with the influence of cigarette smoking on metabolic changes and effectiveness of drugs used in the systemic chemotherapy of the lung cancer. The literature search of interactions between cigarette smoking and drugs used for lung cancer was carried out. The abstracted data mostly involved some induction of key drug-metabolizing enzymes of cytochrome CYP1A1/2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and isoforms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Metabolic changes are important both in the non-chemotherapy and for the drugs used in the chemotherapy. They can change pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of drugs. Primarily, we addressed potential differences in drug effects on smokers and non-smokers. The increased clearance of erlotinib and irinotecan may have impact on effectiveness of the lung cancer therapy. The effects of taxanes and gemcitabine are more complex. The evaluated studies show that continued smoking after lung cancer diagnosis is related to poor prognosis, reduced survival, risk of second primary malignancies, and increased cancer recurrence. Of particular importance is the deterioration in the quality of life and an increased incidence of the adverse drug reactions in smokers. The patient's cigarette smoking history should be considered carefully and smoking cessation must be taken into account."

        "abstract": "Smoking history is a heterogeneous situation for different populations, and numerous studies suggest that smoking cessation is conducive to reduce the mortality of lung cancer. However, no quantitative meta-analysis regarding smoking cessation duration based on different populations has demonstrated it clearly. We systematically searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scoups) till February 2023. Eligible studies reported the association between lung cancer survival and duration of smoking cessation. Additionally, we stratified the study population according to whether they had lung cancer at the time they quit smoking. Studies were pooled with the random-effects model. Out of the 11,361 potential studies initially identified, we included 24 studies involving 969,560 individuals in our analysis. Lung cancer mortality varied across two groups: general quitters and peri-diagnosis quitters. For general quitters, those who had quit smoking for less than 10 years exhibited an RR of 0.64 (95% CI [0.55-0.76]), while those who quit for 10-20 years had an RR of 0.33 (0.25-0.43), over 20 years had an RR of 0.16 (0.11-0.24), and never-smokers had an RR at 0.11 (0.07-0.15). Among peri-diagnosis quitters, the 1-year Overall Survival (OS) showed an RR of 0.80 (0.67-0.96), the 2-year OS had an RR of 0.89 (0.80-0.98), the 3-year OS had an RR of 0.93 (0.84-1.03), and the 5-year OS had an RR of 0.85 (0.76-0.96). Earlier and longer smoking cessation is associated with reduced lung cancer mortality, no matter in which cessation stage for two different populations."

Accelerated lung aging and inflammation mutually reinforce each other, creating a detrimental cycle that contributes to disease progression. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD45) family has been reported to involve in multiple biological processes, including inflammation and senescence. However, the role of GADD45 family in COPD remains elusive. To investigate the role and mechanism of GADD45 family in COPD pathogenesis. Expressions of GADD45 family were evaluated by bioinformatic analysis combined with detections in clinical specimens. The effects of GADD45B on inflammation and senescence were investigated via constructing cell model with siRNA transfection or overexpression lentivirus infection and animal model with Gadd45b knockout. Targeted bisulfite sequencing was performed to probe the influence of DNA methylation in GADD45B expression in COPD. GADD45B expression was significantly increased in COPD patients and strongly associated with lung function, whereas other family members presented no changes. GADD45B upregulation was confirmed in mice exposed by cigarette smoke (CS) and HBE cells treated by CS extract as well. Moreover, experiments involving bidirectional modulation of GADD45B expression in HBE cells further substantiated its positive regulatory role in inflammatory response and cellular senescence. Mechanically, GADD45B-facilitated inflammation was directly mediated by p38 phosphorylation, while GADD45B interacted with FOS to promote cellular senescence in a p38 phosphorylation-independent manner. Furthermore, Gadd45b deficiency remarkably alleviated inflammation and senescence of lungs in CS-exposed mice, as well as improved emphysema and lung function. Eventually, in vivo and vitro experiments demonstrated that GADD45B overexpression was partially mediated by CS-induced DNA hypomethylation. Our findings have shed light on the impact of GADD45B in the pathogenesis of COPD, thereby offering a promising target for intervention in clinical settings."

        "abstract": "The widespread use of marijuana in the context of increasing legalization has both short- and long-term health implications. Although various modes of marijuana use-smoked, vaped, or ingested-may lead to a wide scope of potential systemic effects, we focus here on inhalational use of marijuana as the most common mode with the lung as the organ that is most directly exposed to its effects. Smoked marijuana has been associated with symptoms of chronic bronchitis and histopathologic changes in airway epithelium, but without consistent evidence of long-term decline in pulmonary function. Its role in immunomodulation, both for risk of infection and protection against a hyperinflammatory host response to infection, has been suggested in animal models and in vitro without conclusive extrapolation to humans. Marijuana smoke contains carcinogens like those found in tobacco, raising concern about its role in lung cancer, but evidence is mixed and made challenging by concurrent tobacco use. Vaping may offer a potential degree of harm reduction when compared with smoking marijuana with reduction of exposure to several toxins, including carbon monoxide, and reduction in chronic respiratory symptoms. However, these potential benefits are counterbalanced by risks including vaping-associated lung injury, potentially more intense drug exposure, and other yet not well-understood toxicities. As more states legalize marijuana and the federal government considers changing this from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance, we anticipate an increase in prospective medical studies concerning the risks related to marijuana use. This review is based on currently available data concerning the impact of inhaled marijuana on lung health."

Limited research has investigated risk factors for different RA-ILD subtypes. Therefore, we examined demographic, serologic, and lifestyle associations with RA-ILD subtypes. We systematically identified RA-ILD cases and RA controls without ILD (RA-noILD) in the Brigham RA Sequential Study and Mass General Brigham Biobank RA cohort. We determined RA-ILD subtype (usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP], nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP], and other/indeterminate) through chest high-resolution computed tomography imaging pattern. We investigated associations of demographic, lifestyle, and serologic factors with major RA-ILD subtypes using multivariable logistic regression. Among 3,328 patients with RA, we identified 208 RA-ILD cases and 547 RA-noILD controls. RA-UIP was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per year, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.01-1.05), male sex (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.33-3.48), and seropositivity (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.24-3.48), whereas RA-NSIP was significantly associated only with seropositive status (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.36-7.56). Nonfibrotic ILDs were significantly associated with smoking (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52-5.21). Having three RA-ILD risk factors (male, seropositive, smoking) had an OR of 6.89 (95% CI 2.41-19.7) for RA-UIP compared with having no RA-ILD risk factors. Older age, seropositivity, and male sex were strongly associated with RA-UIP, whereas RA-related autoantibodies were associated with RA-NSIP. These findings suggest RA-ILD sex differences may be driven by RA-UIP and emphasize the importance of further studies to clarify RA-ILD heterogeneity and optimize screening and treatment approaches."

These effects occur throughout childhood, from the antenatal period through to adolescence. Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of environmental insults, and children living in socioeconomic deprivation globally are more likely to breathe air both indoors and outdoors, which poses an acute and long-term risk to their health. Adult respiratory health is, at least in part, determined by exposures and respiratory system development in childhood, starting in utero. This narrative review will discuss, from a global perspective, what contributes to poor IAQ in the child's home and school environment and the impact that indoor air pollution exposure has on respiratory health throughout the different stages of childhood. All children have the right to a living and educational environment without the threat of pollution affecting their health. Action is needed at multiple levels to address this pressing issue to improve lifelong respiratory health. Such action should incorporate a child's rights-based approach, empowering children, and their families, to have access to clean air to breathe in their living environment."

This study investigated the prevalence of tobacco use and nicotine dependence among college students and their stress levels to inform targeted interventions for smoking prevention and cessation. A total of 429 participants were interviewed face-to-face, of which 71.6% were female and 28.4% were male. Pulmonary function tests were exclusively administered to the 9.8% of participants who reported using tobacco. Our findings revealed a low prevalence of nicotine dependence among college students, with only 6.8% exhibiting moderate or high levels of dependence. Students who reported tobacco use were found to have moderate stress levels,suggesting a potential association between smoking and stress. Chi-square tests revealed that gender, school affiliation,and nicotine dependence were significantly associated with smoking behavior. Long-term smoking (>5 years) was found to be associated with negative health outcomes, such as higher BMI, and increased smoking per day. The analysis of lung function parameters showed that smoking frequency and duration were negatively associated with lung function, while nicotine dependence increased with smoking frequency and duration. Our study suggests that targeted prevention and cessation programs should address these factors to reduce smoking rates among college students."

We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking with sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C). Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent quitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs attenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in adults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential methylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary intake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K array were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero smoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy drugs. Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with Illumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers within a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood.

We explored the effect of county-level SFO strength with smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence in Indiana. We obtained county-level lung cancer incidence from the Indiana State Cancer Registry and county-level characteristics from the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission's policy database between 1995 and 2016. Using generalized estimating equations, we performed multivariable analyses of smoking prevalence and age-adjusted lung cancer rates with respect to the strength of smoke-free ordinances at the county level over time. Of Indiana's 92 counties, 24 had a SFO by 2011. In 2012, Indiana enacted a state-wide SFO enforcing at least moderate level SFO protection. Mean age-adjusted lung cancer incidence per year was 76.8 per 100,000 population and mean smoking prevalence per year was 25% during the study period. Counties with comprehensive or moderate SFO had a smoking prevalence 1.2% (95% CI [-1.88, -0.52]) lower compared with counties with weak or no SFO. Counties that had comprehensive or moderate SFO also had an 8.4 (95% CI [-11.5, -5.3]) decrease in new lung cancer diagnosis per 100,000 population per year compared with counties that had weak or no SFO. Counties with stronger smoke-free air ordinances were associated with decreased smoking prevalence and fewer new lung cancer cases per year. Strengthening SFO is paramount to decreasing lung cancer incidence."

The use of hookah dates back centuries and is believed to have originated in India during the reign of Akbar the Great or the Safavid dynasty of Persia. Outside its native region, hookah smoking has gained popularity throughout the world, especially among younger people. There is generally a misconception among hookah users that it is less addictive than combustible cigarette smoking and that there is little to no nicotine content in hookah, with some even believing that certain additives impart health benefits. Although studies investigating the health hazards of hookah are rather limited, the inhaled smoke contains large quantities of nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, carboxylic compounds, and various inorganic compounds such as heavy metals, all of which are found in combustible cigarette smoking. Regular hookah use is associated with an increased risk of obstructive lung disease as well as lung cancer and malignancies of the head and neck. This narrative review summarizes the available data on the health hazards of hookah, with an emphasis on pulmonary complications. Increased knowledge and awareness of hookah smoking among healthcare providers can potentially lead to better patient education and identification of at-risk populations."

With e-cigarettes becoming more and more popular, smokers have more options other than conventional cigarettes. Under these circumstances, a comprehensive evaluation of the general safety of new tobacco and tobacco-related products, represented by e-cigarettes, to human health is necessary. In this review, we summarize the current research on potential negative impacts of e-cigarette exposure on human health. In particular, studies detailing the relationship between e-cigarettes and the digestive system are summarized, with mechanisms mainly including hepatic metabolic dysfunction, impaired gut barrier, and worsened outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although believed to be safer than traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes exert adverse effects on systemic health and induce the development of multiple diseases including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and IBD. Moreover, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes have a negative impact on the childhood development and increase the risk of arterial stiffness compared to the non-nicotine e-cigarettes. However, non-nicotine e-cigarette components have detrimental effects including promoting liver damage and metabolic disorders."

        "abstract": "Smoking is associated with an increased risk of cancer, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, but the precise mechanisms by which such risk is mediated remain poorly understood. Additionally, smoking can impact the oral, nasal, oropharyngeal, lung and gut microbiome composition, function, and secreted molecule repertoire. Microbiome changes induced by smoking can bear direct consequences on smoking-related illnesses. Moreover, smoking-associated dysbiosis may modulate weight gain development following smoking cessation. Here, we review the implications of cigarette smoking on microbiome community structure and function. In addition, we highlight the potential impacts of microbial dysbiosis on smoking-related diseases. We discuss challenges in studying host-microbiome interactions in the context of smoking, such as the correlations with smoking-related disease severity versus causation and mechanism. In all, understanding the microbiome's role in the pathophysiology of smoking-related diseases may promote the development of rational therapies for smoking- and smoking cessation-related disorders, as well as assist in smoking abstinence."

        "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts to combat cigarette smoking/tobacco use, it still remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, killing more than eight million people each year. While tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases related to the four main groups-cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes-its impact on neuropsychiatric risk is rather elusive. The aim of this review article is to emphasize the importance of smoking as a potential risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease and to identify central pathophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship. There is strong evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies indicating that smoking may increase the risk of various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dementia/cognitive decline, schizophrenia/psychosis, depression, anxiety disorder, and suicidal behavior induced by structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system, mainly centered on inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. From a public health perspective, preventive measures and policies designed to counteract the global epidemic of smoking should necessarily include warnings and actions that address the risk of neuropsychiatric disease."

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is turning out to be one of the most devastating global pandemics in the history of humankind. There is a shortage of effective therapeutic strategies or preventative vaccines for this disease to date. A rigorous investigation is needed for identifying and developing more effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis, has been identified as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. Smoking and vaping are potential risk factors for COVID-19 that are also shown to upregulate ACE2 expression. In this review, we have discussed the pathobiology of COVID-19 in the lungs and brain and the role of ACE2 in the transmission and pathobiology of this disease. Furthermore, we have shown possible interactions between nicotine/smoking and ACE2 in the lungs and brain, which could aggravate the transmission and pathobiology of COVID-19, resulting in a poor disease outcome. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review addresses the present global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with respect to its pathobiology in the lungs and brain. It focuses on the potential negative impact of tobacco and nicotine exposure on the outcomes of this disease by interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. It adds to the time-sensitive and critically important growing knowledge about the risk factors, transmission, pathobiology, and prognosis of COVID-19."

        "abstract": "Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with an increased risk of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following lung cancer resection. It remains unclear whether smoking cessation reduces this risk. Retrospective review of a large, prospectively collected database of over 1000 consecutive resections for lung cancer in a quaternary lung cancer centre over a 23-year period. One thousand and thirteen patients underwent curative-intent lobectomy or pneumonectomy between 1995 and 2018. Three hundred and sixty-two patients (36%) were ex-smokers, 314 (31%) were current smokers and 111 (11%) were never smokers. A pre-operative diagnosis of COPD was present in 57% of current smokers, 57% of ex-smokers and 20% of never smokers. Just over 25% of patients experienced a PPC. PPCs were more frequent in current smokers compared to never smokers (27% vs 17%, p = 0.036), however, no difference was seen between current and ex-smokers (p = 0.412) or between never and ex-smokers (p = 0.113). Those with a diagnosis of COPD, independent of smoking status, had a higher frequency of both PPCs (65% vs 35%, p<0.01) and overall complications (60% vs 40%, p<0.01) as well as a longer length of hospital stay (10 vs 9 days, p<0.01). Smoking and COPD are both associated with a higher rate of PPCs post lung cancer resection. COPD, independent of smoking status, is also associated with an increased overall post-operative complication rate and length of hospital stay. An emphasis on COPD treatment optimisation, rather than smoking cessation in isolation, may help improve post-operative outcomes."

        "abstract": "The antecedents of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lie before school age. Adverse effects are transgenerational, antenatal and in the preschool years. Antenatal adverse effects impair spirometry by causing low birth weight, altered lung structure and immune function, and sensitizing the foetus to later insults. The key stages of normal lung health are lung function at birth, lung growth to a plateau age 20-25 years, and the phase of decline thereafter; contrary to perceived wisdom, accelerated decline is not related to smoking. There are different trajectories of lung function. Lung function usually tracks from preschool to late middle age. Asthma is driven by antenatal and early life influences. The airflow obstruction, emphysema and multi-morbidity of COPD all start early. Failure to reach a normal plateau and accelerated decline in lung function are risk factors for COPD. Airway disease cannot be prevented in adult life; prevention must start early."

        "abstract": "Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can be a major constituent of air pollution in indoor environments, including the home. Regulation on smoking in the workplace and public places has made the home the dominant unregulated source of ETS, with important potential impacts on children. Between 40% and 60% of cbildren in the United Kingdom are exposed to ETS in the home. Many experimental and human and studies have investigated the adverse health effects of ETS. Substantial evidence shows that in adults ETS is associated with increased risk of chronic respiratory illness, including lung cancer, nasal cancer, and cardiovascular disease. In children, ETS increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, middle ear disease, lower respiratory tract illness, prevalence of wheeze and cough, and exacerbates asthma. Although banning smoking in the home would be the optimal reduction strategy, several barrier and ventilation methods can be effective. Nevertheless, such methods are not always practical or acceptable, particularly when social pressures contribute to a lack of support for ETS control in the home. Smoking cessation interventions have bad limited success. Research is needed to explore the barriers to adopting ETS risk-reducing behaviors."
