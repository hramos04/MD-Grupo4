Good posture is essential for maintaining long-term musculoskeletal health, as it helps to prevent unnecessary strain on the muscles and joints. According to the study Effects of laptop screen height on neck and shoulder muscle fatigue and spine loading for office workers, published in 2024, poor posture can lead to unfavorable neck-shoulder muscle loads, increasing the risk of neck and shoulder injuries. This is particularly relevant for individuals who spend extended periods using laptops or computers, as they may be more likely to adopt poor postures that can lead to muscle fatigue and discomfort.

The importance of good posture is also highlighted in the study Intraoperative musculoskeletal discomfort and risk for surgeons during open and laparoscopic surgery, published in 2021, which found that surgeons often spend a significant amount of time in high-risk musculoskeletal postures, particularly in the neck, during surgical procedures. This can result in increased levels of fatigue, pain, and subjective workload, emphasizing the need for interventions to protect musculoskeletal health and promote optimal performance. Similarly, the study The Impact of Body Posture on Heart Rate Strain during Tree Felling, published in 2022, demonstrates the impact of posture on musculoskeletal health in physically demanding occupations, such as tree felling, where maintaining good posture can help to prevent unnecessary loadings on the spine and reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

Furthermore, the study Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on low back pain in computer using working adults, published in 2024, highlights the importance of proper ergonomics in preventing musculoskeletal issues, particularly low back pain, in individuals who work from home using computers. The study found that working from home during the COVID-19 lockdown was associated with increased low back pain, which may be attributed to poor ergonomics at home. This emphasizes the need for raising awareness about adopting proper ergonomic practices, both at home and work, to promote spinal health and prevent musculoskeletal issues. Overall, maintaining good posture is crucial for reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and promoting long-term musculoskeletal health, particularly in occupations or activities that involve prolonged periods of sitting, standing, or physical exertion.
