Good posture is crucial for maintaining long-term musculoskeletal health as it reduces muscle fatigue, prevents injuries, and lowers the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Studies show that poor posture, particularly in the neck and shoulders, can lead to increased muscle load and fatigue, as seen in laptop users and surgeons. Surgeons, for instance, experience higher fatigue and pain, especially during longer procedures, highlighting the impact of poor posture on occupational health. In physically demanding tasks like tree felling, maintaining good posture reduces spinal strain and physical exertion, as evidenced by lower heart rate strain in proper postures. Additionally, the shift to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of ergonomics, with poor posture contributing to increased low back pain. Thus, adopting proper posture and ergonomic practices is essential to prevent musculoskeletal issues, enhance productivity, and support overall well-being.
