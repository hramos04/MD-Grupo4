Poor office ergonomics can significantly contribute to chronic back pain, particularly in the low back area. According to the article "Telework-related risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders" (2023), teleworkers who experience musculoskeletal pain and discomfort often do so due to poor ergonomic solutions in their workstation design, resulting in prolonged sitting in non-neutral positions. This can lead to the development and aggravation of musculoskeletal disorders, including chronic back pain. Furthermore, working with inadequately placed screens and laptops, as well as sitting in maladjusted seats without proper ergonomic support, can also exacerbate musculoskeletal pain and discomfort.

The article "Home office versus ergonomic workstation-is the ergonomic risk increased when working at the dining table" highlights the importance of ergonomic adjustments, such as seat and desk height adjustment, as well as armrest adjustment, in reducing the ergonomic risk in the shoulder region, which is closely related to neck pain and, by extension, low back pain. Additionally, the study "A comparison of the effects of ergonomic organization and education interventions on reducing musculoskeletal disorders in office workers" notes that various psychosocial factors, including monotonous work and lack of job satisfaction, can increase complaints of lower back pain, underscoring the complex interplay of factors that contribute to chronic back pain.

The "Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on low back pain in computer using working adults" (2024) study further emphasizes the importance of proper ergonomics in preventing musculoskeletal issues, including low back pain, particularly in the context of remote work. The study found that working from home during the COVID-19 lockdown was associated with increased low back pain in both male and female employees, with poor ergonomics at home being a potential contributing factor. This highlights the need for individuals to adopt proper ergonomic practices, both at home and in the office, to mitigate the risk of chronic back pain and promote overall spinal health.
