 Poor office ergonomics significantly contributes to chronic back pain through several key factors. Firstly, inadequate workstation setups, such as improper chair height, lack of armrests, and insufficient backrest, force individuals into non-neutral postures. Prolonged sitting in such positions strains the lower back, leading to discomfort and pain. Additionally, psychosocial factors like monotonous work and job dissatisfaction can exacerbate back pain, potentially stemming from an uncomfortable work environment. The connection between shoulder and upper arm strain due to poor ergonomics can also affect back posture, as the body may compensate poorly, increasing the risk of back issues. Furthermore, the shift to working from home, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the importance of proper ergonomics, as makeshift workspaces often lack necessary adjustments, leading to increased back pain. Overall, poor ergonomics creates a cycle of strain and discomfort, contributing to chronic back pain if not addressed with proper adjustments and awareness.
