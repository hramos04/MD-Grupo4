Remote workers can significantly improve their home ergonomics by focusing on several key strategies. First, it is crucial to set up an ergonomic workspace. This involves using appropriate furniture, such as a chair with proper lumbar support and a desk that allows for a neutral posture, where elbows are at a 90-degree angle and the computer screen is at eye level. Ensuring the workspace is well-organized to minimize reaching and stretching is also essential.   

Second, regular movement is vital. Prolonged sitting can lead to musculoskeletal issues, so incorporating short breaks every hour to stand, stretch, or walk can help mitigate this risk. Engaging in physical activity outside of work hours further supports overall health and reduces the likelihood of ergonomic-related discomfort.

Third, organizations play a significant role in supporting remote workers. They should provide resources and policies that promote home ergonomics, such as offering ergonomic equipment or guidelines for setting up a home workspace. This support can help address the increased health risks associated with remote work, as highlighted by the 2022 systematic review.

By addressing these areas—workspace setup, movement, and organizational support—remote workers can create a healthier and more efficient work environment, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal issues and enhancing their overall well-being.
