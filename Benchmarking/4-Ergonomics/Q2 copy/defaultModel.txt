To improve their home ergonomics, remote workers should prioritize implementing ergonomic design recommendations, as the absence of such support has been linked to increased health risks, particularly musculoskeletal issues. The necessity for ergonomic design is underscored by the fact that most studies have reported teleworkers experiencing musculoskeletal problems due to inadequate working conditions. Organizations' lack of awareness regarding home-based policies and ergonomics programs further exacerbates the issue, highlighting the need for remote workers to take proactive steps in creating an ergonomic workspace at home. This may involve assessing their current workspace, such as a dining table, to determine if it poses an increased ergonomic risk, and making adjustments accordingly to promote a healthier working environment. By doing so, remote workers can mitigate the health-related consequences associated with poor ergonomics and create a more supportive and comfortable workspace.
