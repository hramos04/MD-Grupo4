You are an expert evaluator. I will give you:

A question

A candidate answer (the response to evaluate)

Evaluate how well the candidate answer responds to the question in terms of accuracy, relevance, clarity, and completeness. Then, give a score from 1 to 10, where:

10 = Excellent, fully answers the question with accuracy and clarity

1 = Very poor, does not answer the question at all or is completely incorrect

Important:
Only output a single number from 1 to 10. Do not explain or justify.

Example Format:

Question: [Insert question]
Candidate Answer: [Insert answer]

Your Output:
[Only a number from 1 to 10]
