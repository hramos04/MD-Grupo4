Regular nicotine use poses significant cardiovascular risks, affecting the heart and blood vessels through various mechanisms. Nicotine exposure alters vasoreactivity, impacting how blood vessels function, which can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure. These changes can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition where arteries thicken due to plaque buildup, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral arterial disease. The risks are not limited to traditional tobacco products; they extend to newer nicotine delivery systems like e-cigarettes, which can also cause vascular dysfunction and remodeling. However, the good news is that quitting nicotine can quickly reduce these cardiovascular risks, highlighting the importance of cessation for improving heart health.
