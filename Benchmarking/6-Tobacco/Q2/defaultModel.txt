The cardiovascular risks of regular nicotine use are a significant concern, as nicotine is the addictive component of all tobacco products and has been shown to have a negative impact on cardiovascular health. According to the article "Nicotine and vascular dysfunction" (2021), nicotine alters vasoreactivity through endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent mechanisms, leading to clinical manifestations in both cigarette smokers and e-cig users. This can result in nicotine-induced vascular dysfunction, which is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, nicotine induces vascular remodelling through its effects on proliferation, migration, and matrix production of both vascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, as noted in the same article.

The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes, has increased dramatically in recent years, partly due to the perception that these products are safe. However, the article "A scoping review of studies on the health impact of electronic nicotine delivery systems" suggests that there is a lack of studies on the impact of switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarettes on cardiovascular disease outcomes. Nevertheless, the article "Tobacco use disorder and cardiovascular health" (2022) emphasizes that smoking increases the incidence of both acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and the harmful effects are substantially and relatively quickly reversible after quitting. This implies that regular nicotine use, regardless of the delivery method, poses a significant risk to cardiovascular health.

The article "The impact of health taxes on consumption of tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages in the Eastern Mediterranean Region" (2024) highlights the significant risk that tobacco and nicotine consumption poses to public health, contributing to increases in noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Globally, deaths related to tobacco and nicotine consumption exceed 8 million annually, including 1.3 million due to exposure to second-hand smoke. This underscores the urgent need for effective public health interventions to curb the consumption of these harmful products and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with regular nicotine use.
