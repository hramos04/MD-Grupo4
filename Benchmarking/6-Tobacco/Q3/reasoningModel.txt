Tobacco is considered a leading preventable cause of death due to its significant impact on global health. It is responsible for over seven million deaths annually, with the majority attributed to cigarette smoking. The addictive nature of nicotine in tobacco products contributes to the persistence of smoking habits, making it challenging for users to quit. Smoking is a major risk factor for various fatal diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. Additionally, it has links to neuropsychiatric conditions, further increasing its deadly impact. The preventable nature of these deaths underscores the importance of public health efforts to reduce tobacco use and save millions of lives.
