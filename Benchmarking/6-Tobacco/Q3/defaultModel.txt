Tobacco is considered a leading preventable cause of death due to its significant contribution to global morbidity and mortality, accounting for more than seven million deaths each year. The majority of these deaths are caused by cigarette smoking, which is the most common form of tobacco use in most countries. According to the available data, an estimated 15.4% of all deaths in the world are attributable to tobacco smoking, making it one of the world's largest preventable causes of premature death. The addictive nature of nicotine, a highly addictive drug found in tobacco and vaping devices, explains why smoking is so prevalent and persistent, leading to a substantial public health threat. Furthermore, tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes, as well as neuropsychiatric diseases, highlighting the importance of addressing tobacco use as a critical factor in preventing premature deaths.

The widespread use of tobacco among young people, with an estimated 25 million youth aged 13-15 years smoking cigarettes globally, further exacerbates the problem, underscoring the need for effective tobacco control measures to prevent the initiation of tobacco use and reduce its harmful effects. The fact that tobacco use is a preventable cause of death emphasizes the potential for interventions, such as pictorial warning labels and public health campaigns, to reduce the burden of tobacco-related illnesses and deaths. Overall, the significant impact of tobacco use on global health and mortality rates warrants continued efforts to combat cigarette smoking and tobacco use, and to develop effective strategies for preventing and treating tobacco addiction.
