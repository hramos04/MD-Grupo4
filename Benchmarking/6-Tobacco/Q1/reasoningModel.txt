Tobacco smoke causes long-term lung damage through several mechanisms. Firstly, it leads to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition that restricts airflow and impairs lung function. Smoking also exacerbates asthma, worsening symptoms and increasing the risk of developing the condition. Additionally, tobacco smoke increases the susceptibility to respiratory infections, such as COVID-19, by elevating ACE2 receptors in the lungs, making them more vulnerable to viral entry. The chemicals in tobacco smoke induce chronic inflammation and damage to lung tissues, further compromising respiratory health. Nicotine's addictive properties prolong exposure to these harmful effects, as smokers continue to inhale toxic substances despite the associated health risks. Overall, tobacco smoke's impact on the lungs is multifaceted, leading to severe and often irreversible damage over time.
