Tobacco smoke damages the lungs over time by causing a range of serious and potentially life-threatening health problems. According to the article "Effects of smoking and tobacco" (2025), smoking is the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a serious, progressive, and disabling condition that limits airflow in the lungs. Additionally, active smoking worsens asthma in active smokers and is associated with an increased risk for asthma in adolescents and adults. The article "The impact of tobacco use on COVID-19 outcomes a systematic review" also notes that tobacco use is a well-documented risk factor for lung disease, and that cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for contracting infectious respiratory diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and MERS, as well as exacerbating the outcomes of those infections. Furthermore, research has found that smoking increases ACE2 receptors in the lungs, indicating that smokers may be more vulnerable to infection. Overall, the cumulative effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs can lead to significant and long-lasting damage, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases and other serious health problems.
