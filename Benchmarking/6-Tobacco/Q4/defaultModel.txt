The effects of passive smoking on children are multifaceted and can have long-lasting consequences on their overall health and well-being. According to the systematic review "Passive Smoking and Oral Health of Infants, Preschoolers, and Children: A Systematic Review" published in 2023, there is a significant association between dental caries in the deciduous dentition and passive smoking, with the majority of studies finding a correlation between passive smoking and increased prevalence of dental caries. Furthermore, prenatal passive smoking exposure has been linked to an increased dental caries experience compared to postnatal exposure, highlighting the importance of early intervention and education on the effects of passive smoking on infants and children.

In addition to oral health conditions, passive smoking has also been linked to other adverse childhood outcomes, including congenital anomalies, infant and teenager overweight and obesity, and neuropsychiatric sequelae, as noted in the article "Impact of Prenatal Exposure to Smoking on Child Health" published in 2022. The indoor environment also plays a significant role in children's pulmonary health, with exposure to poor indoor air quality contributing to potentially lifelong respiratory morbidity, as discussed in the article "Impact of indoor environment on children's pulmonary health" published in 2023. It is estimated that almost half of the world's children experience passive smoking, which is linked to numerous oral health conditions, emphasizing the need for health professionals to pay attention to passive smoking when conducting pediatric patient histories and for early intervention and parental education to minimize the risks associated with secondhand smoke.

The evidence suggests that passive smoking can have a profound impact on children's health, from prenatal exposure to postnatal effects, and that it is essential to address this issue through education and intervention to improve oral health outcomes and reduce smoking-associated systemic conditions. By acknowledging the risks associated with passive smoking and taking steps to minimize exposure, parents and healthcare professionals can work together to promote healthier outcomes for children and reduce the long-term consequences of secondhand smoke exposure.
