Passive smoking has several adverse effects on children, impacting their oral health, overall systemic health, and respiratory well-being.

Oral health is significantly affected, with studies showing a strong correlation between passive smoking and an increased prevalence of dental caries. Prenatal exposure appears to have a more pronounced effect compared to postnatal exposure. Factors such as socioeconomic status and parental education further exacerbate the risk, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

Beyond oral health, passive smoking is linked to systemic health issues. Prenatal exposure is associated with congenital anomalies, obesity, neuropsychiatric conditions, and certain childhood cancers. These effects underscore the broader, long-term health risks that extend beyond childhood.

Respiratory health is another critical area impacted by passive smoking. Poor indoor air quality contributes to potentially lifelong respiratory issues, affecting children from the prenatal stage through adolescence. This emphasizes the importance of addressing environmental factors early to protect respiratory development.

In summary, passive smoking poses significant risks to children's oral, systemic, and respiratory health, necessitating early intervention and parental education to mitigate these effects.
