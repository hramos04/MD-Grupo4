Quitting smoking within the first year significantly improves health outcomes, particularly for individuals with cancer. Studies indicate that cessation reduces cancer mortality by 30-40%, enhances treatment effectiveness, and improves survival rates. For example, one-year survival rates for lung cancer patients who quit around diagnosis show a 20% improvement. Additionally, quitting smoking decreases overall mortality risks associated with cardiovascular diseases and respiratory conditions. The benefits are most pronounced when cessation occurs early, with substantial reductions in smoking-related deaths for those who quit before age 40. Thus, the first year of quitting is crucial for achieving these positive health changes.
