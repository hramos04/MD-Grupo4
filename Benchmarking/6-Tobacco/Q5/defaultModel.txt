Quitting smoking can significantly improve health within the first year, particularly in terms of reducing mortality rates. According to the 2014 US Surgeon General's report, as mentioned in the article "Smoking cessation health system challenges and opportunities", if patients stopped smoking after a cancer diagnosis, cancer mortality could be reduced by 30%â€“40%. Furthermore, the article "A scoping review of studies on the health impact of electronic nicotine delivery systems" notes that quitting before the age of 40 reduces smoking-related deaths by 90%, highlighting the substantial benefits of smoking cessation.

The article "Impact of smoking cessation duration on lung cancer mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis" from 2024 provides more specific data on the benefits of quitting smoking, particularly in the context of lung cancer. The study found that among peri-diagnosis quitters, the 1-year Overall Survival showed a reduced risk ratio of 0.80, indicating a significant improvement in survival rates within the first year of quitting. Additionally, the article "Tobacco smoking after diagnosis of cancer clinical aspects" suggests that stopping smoking within one year before diagnosis can lead to decreased overall mortality among patients, with a 20% lower mortality rate compared to those who continued smoking.

The provision of cessation medication and support, as discussed in the article "Smoking cessation health system challenges and opportunities", can also play a crucial role in helping individuals quit smoking and reducing the discomfort of nicotine withdrawal. Overall, the evidence suggests that quitting smoking can have a significant impact on improving health within the first year, particularly in terms of reducing mortality rates and improving survival rates among cancer patients.
