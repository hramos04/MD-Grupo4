The long-term health effects of regular alcohol use are multifaceted and can have severe consequences on an individual's physical and mental well-being. According to the article "Alcohol and the vasculature: a love-hate relationship?" (2023), alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for various health issues, including liver diseases, cancers, tuberculosis, and injuries. Furthermore, the relationship between alcohol use and cardiovascular risk is complex, with heavy alcohol use and binge drinking harming cardiovascular health, while the effect of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption remains controversial.

Regular alcohol use can also lead to social problems, such as family issues, problems at work, financial difficulties, and unemployment, as stated in the article "Health risks of alcohol use" (2025). Additionally, alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries, and other health conditions, including noncommunicable diseases like liver diseases, heart diseases, and various types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioral conditions such as depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders. The article "Acute alcohol intoxication: a clinical overview" (2022) also highlights the detrimental effects of alcohol intake on the physical, mental, social, and economic health of individuals, causing tissue damage and increasing the risk of certain cancers, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhagic strokes.

It is essential to note that the impact of alcohol use is not limited to the individual, as prenatal alcohol exposure can have severe consequences on fetal health and social outcomes later in life, placing a significant economic burden on countries, as discussed in the article "Alcohol's Impact on the Fetus" (2021). Overall, the long-term health effects of regular alcohol use are far-reaching and can have devastating consequences on an individual's overall health and well-being, as well as on their social and economic stability.
