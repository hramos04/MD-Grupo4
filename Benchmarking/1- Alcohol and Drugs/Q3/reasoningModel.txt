Mixing alcohol with prescription or illegal drugs poses significant health risks, as highlighted by several studies. The combination of alcohol and methamphetamine, for instance, can lead to additive or synergistic effects on behavior and physiology, potentially causing greater harm than the use of each substance alone. This combination impacts key neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems, and may result in neurotoxic effects mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 activity (Combined and sequential effects of alcohol and methamphetamine in animal models, 2021).

Additionally, the use of alcohol with opioids significantly increases road safety risks. Polysubstance use, particularly involving alcohol and opioids, is associated with a higher likelihood of motor vehicle crashes, injuries, and fatalities. This is further supported by studies showing impaired driving performance and an increased risk of driving under the influence (Impacts of alcohol and opioid polysubstance use on road safety: Systematic review, 2022).

Moreover, combining alcohol with other drugs can lead to severe health consequences such as overdose, which may result in death or permanent damage. Alcohol's immunosuppressive effects also increase the risk of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and HIV. The risks associated with alcohol use are dose-dependent, with higher volumes and frequencies of consumption leading to greater harm. Furthermore, counterfeit alcohol can contain toxic contaminants, exacerbating health risks (Alcohol, 2025).      

In summary, mixing alcohol with other substances can lead to enhanced neurological damage, increased risk of accidents, severe health complications, and legal consequences. These risks underscore the importance of avoiding such combinations to protect both individual and public health.
