Mixing alcohol with prescription or illegal drugs poses significant health and societal concerns, as it can lead to additive or synergistic effects on behavior and physiology. The combined exposure to alcohol and other substances, such as methamphetamine, can impact various systems in the body, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems, and can result in neurotoxic effects. Furthermore, the use of alcohol and other drugs can seriously affect driving skills, increasing the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Taking too much of a drug, including prescription drugs, can also result in an overdose, which can be fatal or cause permanent damage to the body.

The risks associated with mixing alcohol and other substances are not limited to individual health consequences, but also have broader societal implications. For instance, polysubstance use, including the combination of alcohol and opioids, can have a significant impact on road safety, increasing the risk of motor vehicle crashes, injuries, and deaths. Additionally, alcohol use is classified as carcinogenic and can increase the risk of several cancer types, as well as communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. The risks associated with alcohol consumption increase in a dose-dependent manner with the volume of alcohol consumed and with frequency of drinking, and can be further exacerbated by the use of surrogate or illegally produced alcohols that may contain toxic contaminants.

Overall, the risks of mixing alcohol with prescription or illegal drugs are substantial and can have severe consequences for individual and public health. It is essential to be aware of these risks and to take steps to minimize them, such as avoiding the use of multiple substances, following prescribed medication regimens, and seeking help if struggling with substance use. By understanding the potential consequences of polysubstance use, individuals can make informed decisions about their health and well-being, and work to reduce the risks associated with alcohol and other substance use.
