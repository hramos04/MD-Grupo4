Recreational drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis, have significant effects on both liver and brain function, as highlighted by several studies. Alcohol consumption, for instance, leads to elevated liver enzymes and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause damage to the liver and other vital organs, including the brain (2024). Similarly, cannabis exposure, particularly when combined with alcohol, has been shown to impair spatial and working memory, suggesting adverse effects on cognitive function (2023). The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying drugs, and changes in drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes can alter drug disposition and toxicity (2021). Additionally, acute alcohol intoxication can severely impact the nervous system and contribute to various health issues, including cancers and cardiovascular problems (2022). Overall, recreational drug use can lead to liver damage, cognitive impairments, and a range of other health complications.
