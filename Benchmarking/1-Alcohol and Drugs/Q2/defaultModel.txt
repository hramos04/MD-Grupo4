Recreational drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis, can have detrimental effects on brain and liver function. According to the study "Prenatal alcohol and tetrahydrocannabinol exposure: Effects on spatial and working memory" (2023), exposure to these substances during critical periods of development can lead to cognitive impairments, including spatial and working memory deficits. Additionally, "Uncovering the impact of alcohol on internal organs and reproductive health: Exploring TLR4/NF-kB and CYP2E1/ROS/Nrf2 pathways" (2024) highlights that excessive alcohol intake can cause damage to vital organs, including the brain, liver, and lungs, by elevating liver enzymes and promoting oxidative stress.

The liver plays a crucial role in eliminating and detoxifying substances, including drugs, and changes in the expression of drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes can impact drug disposition and toxicity, as noted in "Ontogeny of Hepatic Transporters and Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes in Humans and in Nonclinical Species" (2021). Furthermore, "Acute alcohol intoxication: a clinical overview" (2022) emphasizes that alcohol intake can cause a range of tissue damages, including severe impacts on the nervous system, digestive system, and liver, increasing the risk of various cancers and other health problems.

It is also important to consider the broader effects of drug use, as outlined in "Drug Addiction" (2025), which notes that drug use can increase the risk of mental health issues, financial problems, and relationship difficulties, as well as the risk of injury, assault, and legal consequences. Overall, the use of recreational drugs can have far-reaching and devastating consequences for brain and liver function, as well as overall health and wellbeing.
