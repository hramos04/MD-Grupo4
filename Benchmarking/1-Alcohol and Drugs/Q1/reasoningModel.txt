egular alcohol consumption has several long-term health implications, affecting various bodily systems and overall well-being. According to the 2023 article "Alcohol and the vasculature: a love-hate relationship?" and the 2025 WHO fact sheet on "Health risks of alcohol use," alcohol use is linked to an increased risk of liver diseases, multiple types of cancers, and cardiovascular conditions. The 2022 article "Acute alcohol intoxication: a clinical overview" further details that alcohol can damage the nervous, digestive, and cardiovascular systems, contributing to conditions such as diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhagic strokes.

Mental health is also impacted, as noted in the 2025 WHO fact sheet, with associations between alcohol use and disorders like depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders. Socially, harmful alcohol consumption can lead to issues such as family problems, workplace difficulties, financial instability, and unemployment, as highlighted in the same WHO fact sheet.

Additionally, the 2021 article "Alcohol's Impact on the Fetus" underscores the risks of prenatal alcohol exposure, which can result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and associated long-term health and social challenges. This emphasizes the importance of considering alcohol's effects beyond individual health to include societal and economic impacts.

In summary, regular alcohol use poses significant risks to physical health, mental well-being, and social stability, with particular concerns for pregnant individuals. The potential benefits of moderate drinking are debated, while the harms of heavy and binge drinking are well-documented.
