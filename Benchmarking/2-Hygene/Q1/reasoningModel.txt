Personal hygiene plays a crucial role in preventing infectious diseases by effectively reducing the presence of germs on the body and in the environment. Practices such as washing hands with soap and water are highlighted as one of the most effective methods to remove germs that can cause illnesses like gastroenteritis, colds, flu, and COVID-19 ("Personal Hygiene," 2025). This simple act not only protects an individual from getting sick but also prevents the spread of diseases to others.

In addition to handwashing, other hygiene practices such as covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands after handling animals, and maintaining cleanliness in various settings like swimming contribute to disease prevention ("Hygiene Basics," 2025). These practices are part of a broader approach to personal hygiene, which includes washing body parts and hair with soap, grooming nails, and proper menstrual hygiene. Such habits help maintain cleanliness and promote overall health ("Hygiene Basics," 2025).       

The importance of handwashing is further emphasized, especially in settings like healthcare, where it is a critical measure against infections. Even in general contexts, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are unavailable is a recommended alternative ("About Handwashing," 2025). These practices underscore the significance of personal hygiene in both personal health and public health, effectively breaking the chain of infection transmission.

In summary, personal hygiene practices, particularly handwashing, along with other habits like covering coughs and maintaining body cleanliness, are essential in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. They not only protect individuals but also contribute to a healthier community.
