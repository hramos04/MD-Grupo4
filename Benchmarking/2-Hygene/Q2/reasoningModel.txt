Poor hygiene is associated with a range of health issues, both physical and mental. Physically, inadequate hygiene practices can lead to infections such as gastroenteritis, colds, flu, and COVID-19, as germs are not effectively removed from the body. This can result in the spread of diseases to others, highlighting the importance of personal hygiene in public health. Mentally, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions are linked to increased stress and depression, particularly among women, as noted in studies on sanitation access and mental health outcomes. Additionally, poor hygiene contributes to the global burden of disease, as supported by research from 2012 and 2014. Therefore, maintaining good hygiene is crucial for overall well-being, preventing both physical infections and mental health challenges.
