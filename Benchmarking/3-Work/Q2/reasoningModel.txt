Night shift work significantly impacts both sleep patterns and hormone regulation, leading to various health issues. The disruption of the body's internal clock affects the secretion of hormones such as melatonin, cortisol, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Melatonin suppression makes it difficult to fall asleep during the day, while cortisol levels may remain elevated, causing alertness at night. TSH levels increase, indicating potential thyroid strain. Sleep quality diminishes, with reduced REM sleep, contributing to mood disturbances. Additionally, appetite-regulating hormones like ghrelin and leptin are disrupted, increasing the risk of obesity and metabolic issues. Overall, the combination of circadian disruption and poor sleep quality leads to hormonal imbalances that can affect mental and physical health.
