Working over 60 hours a week is associated with several significant health consequences. Prolonged working hours can lead to sleep disturbances, including insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are linked to shift work but also applicable to long hours. Additionally, such extended work periods increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, and mortality. Mental health is also affected, with a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms, particularly in men and those with lower socioeconomic status or limited job resources. Furthermore, long working hours can result in poor physical health, injuries, increased alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. The strain on social and personal time exacerbates these issues, contributing to an overall decline in health and well-being.
