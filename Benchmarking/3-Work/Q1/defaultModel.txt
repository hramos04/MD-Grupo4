Working over 60 hours per week can have severe health consequences, including physical and mental health problems. According to various studies, long working hours are associated with high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality. For instance, research indicates that working 41 hours or more per week can lead to these health issues, and working 55 hours or more per week can further exacerbate them. Additionally, long working hours can lead to sleep disturbances, including insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, which can have a significant impact on overall health and well-being.

The negative health effects of long working hours can vary depending on factors such as gender and socioeconomic status. For example, one study found that the negative health effects of long working hours on males are four times greater than those on females. Furthermore, long working hours can lead to poor physical health, injuries, and depression, as well as increased alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. The impact of long working hours on health can also be influenced by job resources and the level of investment in career development, with more complex jobs potentially having a greater impact on health.

It is essential to consider the cumulative effects of long working hours on health, as the evidence suggests that working extended hours can have detrimental consequences for both physical and mental health. The relationship between long working hours and health is complex, and more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and potential moderators. However, it is clear that working over 60 hours per week can have significant health consequences, and it is crucial to prioritize work-life balance and take steps to mitigate the negative effects of long working hours.
