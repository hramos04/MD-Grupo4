To reduce health risks in shift workers, effective strategies can be implemented, focusing on minimizing circadian disruption, optimizing sleep, and reducing fatigue. Scheduling night shifts in a way that reduces circadian disruption may help decrease the risk of certain health outcomes, such as cancer, particularly breast cancer. Additionally, schedules that optimize sleep and reduce fatigue may lower the occurrence of injuries. It is also essential to consider the concept of fatigue risk management, which encompasses sleepiness countermeasures beyond optimal shift scheduling, including the use of prior-sleep-wake data, fatigue detection technologies, and fatigue-proofing strategies.

At the workplace level, various measures can be applied to counteract the adverse health and safety risks associated with night shift work. For instance, implementing fatigue risk management, adjusting lighting conditions, and allowing self-rostering according to personal preference can be beneficial. These strategies can help mitigate the short-term physiological effects of night shift work, such as circadian disruption, inadequate sleep duration and quality, and fatigue, which are linked to various health and safety risks, including cardio-metabolic disease, injuries, and pregnancy-related outcomes. By adopting these approaches, employers and employees can work together to reduce the health risks associated with shift work and create a safer and healthier work environment.

The importance of addressing the health risks of shift work is underscored by the increasing amount of research on the topic, which has prompted requests from policy-makers, employers, and employees for scientifically based recommendations on scheduling night shift work. As a result, regulations and preventive measures have been implemented by governments and manufacturers to minimize the health risks of shift work. By building on this knowledge and continuing to explore effective strategies for reducing health risks in shift workers, it is possible to promote better health and well-being among this group of workers.
