Sleep is especially important for teenagers and young adults due to the significant physical, mental, and emotional changes they undergo during this stage of life. As described in the article "Normal Sleep in Children and Adolescence" (2021), adequate sleep contributes to good physical health, immune function, mental health, and academic performance, all of which are crucial for healthy development. The regulation and architecture of sleep change greatly across childhood and adolescence, and factors such as early school start times, technology use, and changes to circadian rhythms can impact the ability to obtain sufficient sleep.

The importance of sleep for teenagers and young adults is further emphasized by the fact that they are undergoing rapid growth and daily development, as noted in the article "When to Put Devices to Bed" (2025). This requires a significant amount of sleep, with children and teens needing anywhere between 8 and 13 hours of sleep a night, depending on their age. However, screen use, especially before bed, can negatively impact the quality and quantity of sleep, highlighting the need for responsible technology use habits. Additionally, the article "Sleep, Nutrition, and Injury Risk in Adolescent Athletes: A Narrative Review" (2023) suggests that inadequate sleep during adolescence can increase the likelihood of injury, particularly in adolescent athletes, due to the significant burden it places on their ability to recover.

The article "Adolescent sleep and the foundations of prefrontal cortical development and dysfunction" (2022) also highlights the critical role of sleep in brain development during adolescence, particularly in the refinement of neural connectivity and the maturation of the prefrontal cortex. This brain region is responsible for decision-making, reward processing, social interactions, and emotion, and even subtle disruption of its development during adolescence may have enduring impacts. Furthermore, the article "Sleep deprivation sleep disorders and chronic disease" notes that inadequate sleep can have uncertain effects on brain development, mental health, and vascular health, and may even contribute to the risk of chronic diseases, making it essential for teenagers and young adults to prioritize sleep as a vital aspect of their overall health and well-being.
