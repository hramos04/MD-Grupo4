Poor sleep quality has profound effects on both mental and physical health, impacting various aspects of daily functioning and long-term well-being. Mentally, it can lead to mood disturbances such as irritability and anxiety, as well as more severe conditions like depression and substance use disorders. Cognitively, poor sleep impairs alertness, attention, and memory, making it difficult to perform daily tasks efficiently.

Physically, inadequate sleep is linked to serious health issues, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. It also weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections. Additionally, poor sleep can affect reproductive health and hormone regulation, which are crucial for overall bodily functions.    

Chronic sleep deficiency can lead to increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases and exacerbate existing psychiatric and medical conditions. Factors such as occupation, social demands, and psychiatric disorders can contribute to sleep deficiency, which in turn affects renal function, immune response, and respiratory health.

In summary, poor sleep quality not only disrupts daily life by causing fatigue and reducing productivity but also poses significant long-term risks to both mental and physical health, highlighting the importance of addressing sleep issues to maintain overall well-being.
