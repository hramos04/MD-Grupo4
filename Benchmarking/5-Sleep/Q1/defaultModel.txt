Poor sleep quality has a profound impact on both mental and physical health, as it plays a fundamental role in maintaining and improving overall well-being. Sleep is involved in emotion regulation and immune functions, and a single night of sleep deprivation can lead to significant mood disturbances and lower immune defenses. Chronic insomnia and prolonged sleep loss increase the risks of long-term adverse consequences, including mental depression, substance use, physical hypertension, diabetes, and occupational health disability. Furthermore, sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders can lead to significant morbidity and contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The consequences of poor sleep quality include fatigue, irritability, daytime dysfunction, slowed responses, and increased caffeine or alcohol intake, ultimately contributing to disease and poor health outcomes.

The importance of sleep quality cannot be overstated, as it affects every organ and system of the body, from the brain to the heart and from cellular metabolism to immune function. A consistent daily schedule of quality sleep is essential for overall health and well-being, and poor quality sleep over time increases the risk of developing serious medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, sleep deficiency, resulting from short sleep or suboptimal sleep quality, is highly prevalent in modern society and influences various aspects of health, including cognition, alertness, mood, behavior, diabetes, cardiovascular health, renal function, immune system, and respiratory physiology. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize sleep quality and address any sleep-related issues to maintain optimal physical and mental health.     

The attributes of sleep quality, including sleep efficiency, sleep latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset, are influenced by various factors, such as physiological, psychological, and environmental factors, as well as family and social commitments. Good sleep quality has positive effects, such as feeling rested, normal reflexes, and positive relationships, highlighting the need to adopt healthy sleep habits and lifestyle interventions to improve sleep quality. By doing so, individuals can reduce the risk of sleep-related disorders and promote overall health and well-being. As sleep is a critical part of daily routine, it is essential to make a consistent effort to prioritize sleep quality and seek help if sleep-related issues arise.
